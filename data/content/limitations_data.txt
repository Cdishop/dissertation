Definition of affiliative OCB

common items of affiliative OCB

This data source is posisitive because it captures helping prompts that are definitely not part of someone’s formal job description. 

The limitation of this data source is that requests could come from outside the organization. Is that an issue?

In these github data sources, people act to enhance the functioning of a collective, but the collective is broader than just a single organization. 
- perhaps that’s ocb, perhaps it isn’t.


(b)


The limitation of this data source is that prompts can come from people who are not direct colleagues.
- but they are in a sense…they are colleagues in the sense that they want to use the package
- is there any definition that says you have to help people within the same company?
