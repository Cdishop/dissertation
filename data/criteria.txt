# What am I trying to show?

Opportunities follow a random walk.




(a) data on opportunities over time

- where to look
- how hard is it to scrape?
- what am I actually scraping?
- how many walks do I need?
- how many time points?


(b) how do you know it is actually an opportunity?

- nature of the person where the data comes from (academics)
++ if academic, then issues are not part of formal rewards

- definition
- SME sorting: read email, sort it into respect OCB dimension
- participant questionnaire: read definition of OCB, read data source. Agree or disagree that the data source captures OCBs?


(c) assuming that people actually respond to the opportunity

How to deal with this attack
- yes, that's my assumption
- quotes about OCBs are "responses to..."
- data on people actually responding

I'm selecting for people with long issue histories. There are people that create packages with no issues.
