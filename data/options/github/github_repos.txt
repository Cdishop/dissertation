Future scraping by starting with all github issues:
- filter to only "question" tags
- filter to only those who opened an issue that differ from the person who owns the repo
- filter to only those who closed the issue that match the person who owns the repo


Next steps
- something with projects
- the amount of "just wait and let the person say 'oops ok i figured it out'"
- people who have "helper engineers". E.g., guy below seems to have people responding for him
