# 1 - yielding extra milers by creating accumulation

Both agents resolve all requests in their environment, they are equally altruistic. After time 1 point, both have requests at 0. Then, A receives 2 requests and B receives 4. Both resolve all of them. Then, A receives 1 request and B receives 0. Both resolve all of them. Over time, neither will emerge as the extra miler. 


What is required for an extra miler to emerge?

You need to allow the requests to accumulate somehow. 


(a) people can only respond to a fraction of the incoming requests

50% rather than 100%. 

(b) the agents have a set number of requests that they resolve and requests come in in larger amounts than what they can resolve

Agent A and B can resolve 3 requests per time point (i.e., they resolve all requests if 3 or under). If the error term on the random walk is greater than 3, then an extra miler will emerge. 

They could satisfice on 0 requests per time point or on resolving X number of requests per time point and this effect would still work

(c) the requests are allowed to accumulate on their own for 10 time points before the agents resolve them

For 10 time points requests compile. Now the agents act. For 10 time points the requests compile. Now the agents act.

All of these are equivalent



## creating accumulation by adding a delay or by receiving so many requests that you cannot resolve them all.



## Nick's point is that I need to cite some literature showing that "people have an ability or desire to respond to 2 requests per time point" is legit
- discrepancy theory
- satisfycing
- need theory


## this should turn into a theory paper

The 4 mechanisms that generate extra milers.
- accumulation is what you need. How do you get accumulation?
++ delay
++ people desire only to complete some of their requests
++ the requests come in at such large amounts that they cannot keep up

Make all of these propositions. Have a theory explaining each. This is an AMR paper. 



## the perspective is accumulation, not chance.

Point to requests in someone's environment. Point to accumulating. 



AMR theory Paper
- Extra Milers and Good Soldiers
- Individual characteristics predictors
- we know that behaviors are the result of both person and environment interactions.
- You can think of this behavior pattern as a "long-lead"
- We point to a mechanism that generates long-leads: accumulation

- person things that generate accumulation
++ desire to resolve only a fraction of requests
++ desire to resolve only a specific number of requests
++ desire to respond only a given number of times

- environment things that generate accumulation
++ delay
++ many requests coming in at a single time point
++ autoregression, effects have long lasting impacts (theory of cumulative advantage)

None of these things on their own generate the effect. You have to consider their interaction. A person has an ability and desire to respond to requests. If that's more than what the environment is providing...etc.










# 2 - you observe equivalent results regardless of whether people respond to high vs low numbers of requests

(a) more requests = more help

At each time point, I resolve 20% of my requests. 20% of 100 is more than 20% of 10, so if I have more opportunities then I help more.

This yields extra milers.

(b) fewer requests = more help

At each time point, the help I provide is 1/(1 + X), X being the number of requests that I have

This yields extra milers. 




## perspectives

- theory about opportunities and actions. More opportunity = more action
- limited resources (paper that's similar to my ocb aggregate) theory











# 3 - sheer number vs rate/trend/tik


(a) sheer number

At each time point, agents resolve 20% (or 1 / (1 + x)) of their requests. 

This yields extra milers.


(b) trend/rate/tik

-- (included sheer notion)

Agents only resolve issues when they witness an uptick (or receive number of requests at a given time point that is an outlier). Once that happens, they resolve 20% (or 1 / (1 + x)) of their requests.

This yields extra milers.

-- just trend

At each time point, agents respond to an uptick but not down tick or same number in their requests. 

This does not yield extra milers.










# 4 - compare against individual differences


Agent A resolves 4, agent B resolves 2. Agent A is the more altruistic person...but he or she may have fewer opportunities. 











# 5 - conformity and mimicing others

I try to match my partner. If he or she responds, then I respond.
- if sheer number, this yields no extra miler
- if fraction, this yields extra miler







# Next question. Which do I want to combine? Do I want all of these?
