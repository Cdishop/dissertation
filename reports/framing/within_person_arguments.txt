Two issues with within-person ideas and OCBs. The first is easy to understand, the second is not.


First, many people who examine within-person variance in OCBs argue that they have contracted the idea of good soldiers. Prior research discussed good soldiers, meaning that some people demonstrates sustained, superior levels of OCBs compared to his or her peers. I then go and examine OCBs over time and find that they exhibit within-person variance, arguing that I've contradicted the notion of good soldiers. So, there's an assumption that both cannot be true at the same time. But they can. Three employees could all show within-person fluctuations in OCBs but one could be fluctuating around a higher set point compared to the others. This person would show dips and peaks in their OCBs, but at each time point he or she would still be higher than his or her peers, and so she would still be a good soldier. Both can be true simultaneously.

The second has to do with the stability of causes and outcomes. People often assume that unstable outcomes must have unstable causes. Complex outcomes must have complex causes. Similarly, complex causes must cause complex outcomes. Unstable causes must cause unstable outcomes. We know that this is not true. Causes that show no systematic variance can produce what looks like systematic outcomes. Similarly, causes that demonstrate systematic variance can cause what looks like no systematic outcomes. In the OCB literature, there is a study or two that has implied that, because the causes of OCBs are unstable or demonstrate variance, then OCBs must also exhibit variance and be unstable. The idea of static, sutained, high OCB cannot be true because the causes fluctuate. I want to show that fluctuating causes can actually produce what looks like long-run stability. No systematic variance in the cause can produce what looks like systematic variance in the outcome.
