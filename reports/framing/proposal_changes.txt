# My questions

1) ok to drop facebook posts?

2) you still have to be PI




# Rick's points


* persuading rather than just giving it
* broadened, better at selling goods


1) broad, then narrow

bandura
FAE
notion of situation and person and the interaction
rich get richer social capital and receiving requests

then you say. if you don't have the opportunity, none of this other stuff matters. That's what i'm focusing on. what's the impact of the opportunity?


what about chance and back discussion of that yielding stuff
- yes, keep
- have it be part of the zoom in approach

2)

solicited. Not opportunities. Requests.

3)

don't include academics in github requests.

4)

facebook no data. That's cool. Just make sure they know about te decisions. 











2) add person into simulation


1) framing

Situation by person interaction. Full model then zoom.

Maybe fred wants me to mimic his adaptive portfolio idea
- bandura
- SOR murray / skinner. Stimulus, response , org 
- people are functions of both persons and environment

2) assumption part needs to be different ways of responding

Here are 4 ways people might respond (based on the literature)
- constant percent
- variance

3) solicited helping

requests for help
- don't say opportunities



# writing about proposal comments that I want to reflect on


AM1) I was thinking fundamental attribution error. How is this more than that?

It's silly, but I didn't go to FAE because I didn't want to make it sound like I was saying that other researchers were making an "error." That seems mean and unecessary. 

The other aspect is it has to do with a comparison. In my mind, and perhaps I'm wrong, but in my mind FAE says that I infer personal characteristics about you when I witness your outcomes and actions, whereas I focus much more on context when I think about myself. When I think about myself, I'm much more likely to acknowledge that uncontrollable situational things happen compared to when I'm thinking aout you. So my reading of that literature is that you have to be making such a comparison. 

In this research, I'm not talking about a comparison really. I'm saying that a mechanism on requests can yield a pattern. And if you view that pattern from the outside it could look a lot like someone's personal characteristics are driving the pattern. 

My paper is about the driving force that creates a pattern, FAE is about the person on the outside who is viewing the pattern. But yes I suppose I could cite it and just mention it.


Fred1) Missing the altnerative of social capital and how people accumulate requests through it

I respond to a request and I get AM to like me. Subsequently, she sends me more requests. Or, I help more than AM so people send requests my way in the future. Through the accumulation of social capital I acquare requests.

You should have competing models. Here is a model of random requests -- it's just a coin flip. Independent from moment to moment. And here is a model of social capital. Which one fits the data better?


** my response ** 

First, random walks aren't coin flips and independent from moment to moment. It's a coin flip about which way the walk moves, but the continuity is there. There is autoregression from moment to moment, there is a relationship between now and the next step. That's crucial. 

The second piece is really hard. It's a challenging idea to consider: the random walk isn't a competing model, it's a permission model. Here's the trajectory of someone's requests over time. This could be generated by any number of processes. One of them may be a social capital process, or it could be due to any other process. If I find evidence of a random walk, then I do not have permission to carry on. This trajectory is not sufficiently "non-random" to be able to parse meaningful from random variance. So we're done. It's a random walk, no meaningful model can be parsed.

It's just like a t test on a mean difference in a cross-sectional study. I have a mean difference but the difference is not so large that I can say it probably wasn't due to chance. Chance could have created this small mean difference. I'm done, there is no meaningful model to be parsed. There is no social capital effect to be understood. In cross-sectional research we typically don't focus on how cool it is that randomness can produce stuff, we focus on minimizing randomness to draw attention to other effects. The equivalent of my research in a cross-sectional study would be, look at this mean difference that randomness can create!! In my paper, I'm saying, "look at this trajectory over time that randomness can create"!!

Also keep in mind that it's possible that a social capital accumulation process could yield a random walk. In other words, you are describing it as if such a social capital approach wouldn't be consistent with a random walk trajectory. I actually think it could be because a random walk can have trend. 


Nick1) I think your two big statements are, (1) pay attention to the situation and (2) requests are random.

Yes and no. I am saying, (1) pay attention to the situation and (2) IF requests are random they can yield a meaningful pattern. (2) Requests need not be systematic to produce a seemingly meaningful pattern. Random requests may only be 15% of the population, or 5%, but they can produce a pattern.

Nick2) Ok, then people are going to downplay you.

Hmm, if requests are random then they can create this outcome. Cool. But the effects I'm studying aren't random so throw it aside.
