While methods existed to measure event weighting and the utility for gains and losses separately, there was no method to measure loss aversion under ambiguity. Our method allows this and thereby it can measure prospect theory’s entire utility function. Consequently, we can properly identify properties of utility and perform new tests of prospect theory. We implemented our method in an experiment and obtained support for prospect theory. Utility was concave for gains and convex for losses and there was substantial loss aversion. Both utility and loss aversion were the same for risk and ambiguity, as assumed by prospect theory, and sign-comonotonic trade-off consistency, the central condition of prospect theory, held.},

  abstract = {Based mainly on the results of cross-sectional studies, the dominant trend in the extant literature on job stress and organizational commitment posits a one-way directional relationship in which job stress negatively impacts organizational commitment. Moreover, research shows that job satisfaction fully mediates this relationship. The present study revisits the conceptual and methodological issues related to these relationships by employing a three-wave longitudinal design with 252 employees in two industrial organizations to test a model that involves a mutual relationship between job stress and organizational commitment in which job satisfaction partially mediates this reciprocal relationship. This proposed model was tested against and was preferable to numerous competing models. This study presents a new framework with more elaborate relationships between job stress, organizational commitment, and job satisfaction. It contributes to the current body of knowledge by revealing a dynamic relationship between organizational commitment and job stress (i.e., a feedback loop) and the dual mediating roles of job satisfaction in this mutual relationship, thereby providing greater insight into the mechanism by which these variables are interrelated. On a practical level, based on the supported mutual relationships between job stress, organizational commitment, and job satisfaction, focusing on the factors that commonly have beneficial effects on these three constructs is expected to intensify employees’ well-being and provide more flexibility to intervening organizational actions aimed at managing these variables.},

In two separate experiments, subjects performed a laboratory task and completed a task satisfaction instrument. Subjects were then randomly told that their scores indicated either a high or low level of satisfaction. In the first experiment, in which the task was performed individually, subjects given satisfaction feedback rated the task as higher in job scope on the Job Diagnostic Survey than subjects given dissatisfaction feedback. In the second experiment, in which the task was performed in three-person groups, subjects given satisfaction feedback, as compared with those given dissatisfaction feedback, rated the group atmosphere, the physical environment, and other characteristics of the task situation as having been more positive. The results of these experiments raise serious questions about the previous causal interpretations for job characteristics—job satisfaction correlations based on cross-sectional, self-report data.},

  abstract = {Sex differences in children’s toy preferences are thought by many to arise from gender socialization. However, evidence from patients with endocrine disorders suggests that biological factors during early development (e.g., levels of androgens) are influential. In this study, we found that vervet monkeys (Cercopithecus aethiops sabaeus) show sex differences in toy preferences similar to those documented previously in children. The percent of contact time with toys typically preferred by boys (a car and a ball) was greater in male vervets (n = 33) than in female vervets (n = 30) ( P {$<$} .05), whereas the percent of contact time with toys typically preferred by girls (a doll and a pot) was greater in female vervets than in male vervets ( P {$<$} .01). In contrast, contact time with toys preferred equally by boys and girls (a picture book and a stuffed dog) was comparable in male and female vervets. The results suggest that sexually differentiated object preferences arose early in human evolution, prior to the emergence of a distinct hominid lineage. This implies that sexually dimorphic preferences for features (e.g., color, shape, movement) may have evolved from differential selection pressures based on the different behavioral roles of males and females, and that evolved object feature preferences may contribute to present day sexually dimorphic toy preferences in children.

Here we show that the same problems can be solved by maximum likelihood (ML) estimation implemented with standard software packages for structural equation modeling (SEM). Monte Carlo simulations show that the ML-SEM method is less biased and more efficient than the GMM method under a wide range of conditions. ML-SEM also makes it possible to test and relax many of the constraints that are typically embodied in dynamic panel models.},

Results indicate that teams engage in vertical communications aimed at molding the views of top management, horizontal communication aimed at coordinating work and obtaining feedback, and horizontal communication aimed at general scanning of the technical and market environment. Organizational teams appear to develop distinct strategies toward their environment: some specialize in particular external activities, some remain isolated from the external environment, and others engage in multiple external activities. The paper shows that the type of external communication teams engage in, not just the amount, determines performance. Over time, teams following a comprehensive strategy enter positive cycles of external activity, internal processes, and performance that enable long-term team success.},

The results of model comparison tests in both samples supported the importance of specifying correlations among the residuals, and many of the residual correlations were statistically significant. Moreover, specifying residual correlations resulted in most of the significant parameter estimates representing reciprocal effects becoming nonsignificant.

  abstract = {Dispersed teams—teams whose members are geographically distributed across different locations—are becoming more prevalent in today's organizations. Despite their increasing prevalence, the empirical research on these teams has been surprisingly scant. The research that has been conducted in this area has typically occurred in the laboratory or with the use of student teams.
In this dissertation, I uncover the effect of geographical dispersion on team communication, coordination, and performance and examine whether task interdependence and task uncertainty moderate the effect of dispersion on teams. I introduce two theoretical lenses through which I explore how dispersion can impact teams. While theoretical and empirical work on proximity suggests that dispersed teams will be associated with communication and coordination problems, and, hence with lower levels of performance, network theory suggests that dispersed teams may be associated with non-redundant information benefits that can increase team performance. Writings of organizational theory suggest that task interdependence and task uncertainty would exacerbate the negative effect of dispersion on coordination problems and team performance. Data was collected through a field study of 85 process improvement teams in a large, multinational organization in the high-tech industry. The members of these teams are distributed across geographies and time zones. Spatial and temporal dispersion were not related to the amount of communication problems experienced by the team, but they were positively related to the amount of coordination problems experienced by the team. Interestingly, when controlling for such process loss, spatial and temporal dispersion were found to be positively and significantly associated with team performance. No evidence was found for the existence of boundary conditions; task interdependence and task uncertainty did not moderate the effect of dispersion on coordination problems and performance in the expected direction. This study therefore reveals countervailing effects of geographical dispersion on teams: while dispersion appears to negatively impact coordination, it appears to be beneficial for the team's output.},

We agree that situational judgment tests (SJTs) can be considered a type of gamified assessment, and gamification provides a toolkit to make SJTs even more gameful. However, the term gamification refers to a much broader and potentially more impactful set of tools than just SJTs, which are incremental, versatile, and especially valuable to practitioners in an era moving toward business-to-consumer (B2C) assessment models. In this commentary, we contend that gamification is commonly misunderstood and misapplied by I-O psychologists, and our goals are to remedy such misconceptions and to provide a research agenda designed to improve both the science and the practice surrounding gamification of human resource processes.},

  abstract = {Dynamic panel models are a popular approach to study interrelationships between repeatedly measured variables. Often, dynamic panel models are specified and estimated within a structural equation modeling (SEM) framework. An endemic problem threatening the validity of such models is unmodelled heterogeneity. Recently, individual parameter contribution (IPC) regression was proposed as a flexible method to study heterogeneity in SEM parameters as a function of observed covariates. In the present paper, we derive how IPCs can be calculated for general maximum likelihood estimates and evaluate the performance of IPC regression to estimate group differences in dynamic panel models in discrete and continuous time. We show that IPC regression can be slightly biased in samples with large group differences and present a bias correction procedure. IPC regression showed generally promising results for discrete time models. However, due to highly nonlinear parameter constraints, caution is indicated when applying IPC regression to continuous time models.},

What is less well understood is that conventional estimation practices for observational studies may produce the same problem even with a representative sample. Causal effects estimated via multiple regression differentially weight each unit's contribution. The “effective sample” that regression uses to generate the estimate may bear little resemblance to the population of interest, and the results may be nonrepresentative in a manner similar to what quasi-experimental methods or experiments with convenience samples produce. There is no general external validity basis for preferring multiple regression on representative samples over quasi-experimental or experimental methods. We show how to estimate the “multiple regression weights” that allow one to study the effective sample. We discuss alternative approaches that, under certain conditions, recover representative average causal effects. The requisite conditions cannot always be met.},

Background: Although an analysis of task and job interdependence has important implications and uses in domains such as job design, selection, and training, the job analysis literature has been slow to develop an effective method to identify team-based tasks and jobs.
Method: To achieve the study’s objectives, 140 F-16 fighter pilots (35 four-person teams) rated 34 task and activity statements in terms of their team relatedness and team workflow.
Results: The results indicated that team relatedness and team workflow effectively differentiated between tasks with varying levels of interdependency (as identified by instructor pilots who served as subject matter experts) within the same job. In addition, teams that accurately perceived the level of interdependency performed better on a four-ship F-16 flight-training program than those that did not.
Conclusion: Team relatedness and team workflow ratings can effectively differentiate between tasks with varying levels of interdependency.},

  abstract = {Computational methods combined with traditional empirical techniques offer a powerful new approach to the study of human performance. In this collection of three studies, I first review the state of modern computational modeling and find a steady increase in the incorporation of dynamic, adaptive, and realistic behaviors of agents in social network settings. However, my analysis suggests areas that can be addressed in the next generation of organizational simulation systems. I compare 28 models according to more than 200 evaluation criteria, ranging from simple representations of agent demographic and performance characteristics, to more richly defined instantiations of behavioral attributes, interaction with non-agent entities, model flexibility, communication channels, simulation types, knowledge, transactive memory, task complexity, and resource networks. I assess trends across these criteria, discuss practical applications, and propose an agenda for future research and development.
In the second study, using a modified version of one of the models reviewed in the first study, I examine the link between individual performance and group outcomes. Using newly created network-based measures of individual knowledge and task exclusivity along with simulations based on empirical data obtained from a software development firm, I investigate the relative effectiveness of social network theory and resource dependency theory as predictors of individuals' contributions to group performance. Results indicate that individual impacts on group performance are even more closely associated with knowledge and task dimensions than with social network structure. Furthermore, given that knowledge may be assessed a priori, I explore factors that may provide useful guidance for structuring teams and predicting team performance.
In the third study, I integrate psychological, social network, and organizational learning theories to investigate the extent to which the amount and structure of a work group's transactive memory explains the relationship between the group's collective experience and its performance. I use network surveys and archival data obtained from 1,456 individuals and 87 managers on 118 diverse work teams in four Fortune 500 companies as the basis for analyzing relationships between transactive memory, group experience, and group performance. I find that group transactive memory partially mediates the link between group experience and performance. In addition, the degree of "small-worldness" exhibited in the structure of group transactive memory moderates the memory's mediating effect on group learning. I discuss the study's findings, practical implications, and limitations as well as how the findings may extend to inter-group, organization, interorganizational, and even societal levels.
Finally, I provide a path for computational extensions of these studies in future research efforts. In particular, I propose modifications of the multi-agent model used in the second study ("Construct") that will enable dynamic simulation of agent-level learning that builds to group and organizational level learning. I also suggest a step-by-step methodology for calibrating, validating, and conducting a multi-agent simulation-based study of organizational learning.},

Health economic analyses generally ignore ambiguity preferences and assume that they are the same as preferences under risk. We show how health preferences can be measured under ambiguity, and we compare them with health preferences under risk. We assume a general ambiguity model that includes many of the ambiguity models that have been proposed in the literature. For health gains, ambiguity preferences and risk preferences were indeed the same. For health losses, they differed with subjects being more pessimistic in decision under ambiguity. Utility and loss aversion were the same for risk and ambiguity. Our results imply that reducing the clinical ambiguity of health losses has more impact than reducing the ambiguity of health gains, that utilities elicited with known probabilities may not carry over to an ambiguous setting, and that ambiguity aversion may impact value of information analyses if losses are involved. These findings are highly relevant for medical decision making, because most medical interventions involve losses.},

We propose a method to separate ambiguity attitudes from subjective probabilities and to decompose ambiguity attitudes into two components. Under models like prospect theory that represent ambiguity through nonadditive decision weights these components reflect pessimism and likelihood insensitivity. Under multiple priors models, they reflect ambiguity aversion and perceived ambiguity. We apply our method in an experiment where we elicit the ask prices of options with payoffs depending on the returns of initial public offerings (IPOs) on the New York Stock Exchange. IPOs are a natural context to study the effect of learning, as prior information about their returns is unavailable. Subjects perceived substantial ambiguity and they were insensitive to likelihood information. We observed only little pessimism and ambiguity aversion. Subjective probabilities were well-calibrated and close to the true frequencies. Subjects’ behavior moved towards expected utility with more information, but substantial deviations remained even in the maximum information condition.},

  abstract = {The carbon and oxygen isotopic composition of the mineral phase of tooth enamel is linked to diet and environment. Enamel is not remodelled once formed. Several studies of intra-tooth isotopic variability in hypsodont mammal teeth have involved sequential sampling of enamel in order to detect changes in diet and environment during tooth formation. The possibility of exploring individual history opens the door to many applications, particularly in palaeoenvironment and herd management reconstruction. However, previous histological investigations have shown that enamel mineralization is a progressive and discontinuous process. The goal of the present study is to determine if this pattern significantly influences the time resolution of an intra-tooth sequential sampling. Isotopic analyses (δ13C) were performed on tooth enamel from steers (Bos taurus) that had changed from a C3 plant-based diet to a C4 plant-based diet with very different carbon isotopic compositions. The change of diet was reflected in the mineral phase of enamel. The pattern of intra-tooth isotopic variation suggests that completion of enamel mineralization required six to seven months. Such a lag in enamel mineralization will decrease the time resolution of enamel sequential sampling. The effects of prolonged mineralization of enamel have to be considered when interpreting patterns of intra-tooth isotopic variations. Copyright © 2002 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Psychological theories have neglected the fundamental issue of what determines people's life paths. The central thesis of this article is that chance encounters play a prominent role in shaping the course of human lives. In a chance encounter the separate chains of events have their own causal determinants, but their intersection occurs fortuitously rather than through deliberate plan. Some fortuitous encounters touch only lightly, others leave more lasting effects, and still others branch people into new trajectories of life. A science of psychology cannot shed much light on the occurrence of fortuitous encounters, but it can provide the basis for predicting the impact they will have on human lives. An analysis is presented of personal factors and milieu properties that govern the branching power of chance encounters.},

  abstract = {Personnel selection involves exchanges of information between job market actors (applicants and organizations). These actors do not have an incentive to exchange accurate information about their ability and commitment to the employment relationship unless it is to their advantage. This state of affairs explains numerous phenomena in personnel selection (e.g., faking). Signaling theory describes a mechanism by which parties with partly conflicting interests (and thus an incentive for deception) can nevertheless exchange accurate information. We apply signaling theory to personnel selection, distinguishing between adaptive relationships between applicants and organizations, among applicants, and among organizations. In each case, repeated adaptations and counteradaptations between actors can lead to situations of equilibrium or escalation (arms races). We show that viewing personnel selection as a network of adaptive relationships among job market actors enables an understanding of both classic and underexplored micro- and macro-level selection phenomena and their dynamic interactions.

We begin with a useful general description of what open science in organizational research represents and adopt a question-and-answer format. Through this format, we then focus on the application of specific open science practices and explore future directions of open science. All of this builds up to a series of specific actionable recommendations provided in conclusion, to help individual researchers, reviewers, journal editors, and other stakeholders develop a more open research environment and culture.},

Much evidence supports this perspective, but some important tests are missing, casting doubts on studies that relied on the perspective for inference. We used a multimethod multitrait design to extensively test the validity of the dual perspective. The dataset (N ϭ 24,015) included measurements of attitudes in 3 domains (race, politics, the self) with 7 indirect measures, and at least 3 self-report measures for each attitude domain. The dual-attitude model fit the data better than a single-attitude model. Six of the 7 indirect measures were related to the implicit construct more than to the explicit construct. The evidence supports the dual-attitude perspective, bolsters the validation of 6 indirect measures, and clears doubts from countless previous studies that used only one indirect measure to draw conclusions about implicit attitudes.},

Until recently, this literature has been completely isolated from the organizational psychology literature. The purpose of this paper is to further extend the sleep literature into the organizational psychology literature, with a focus on self-regulation in the workplace. I summarize the sleep literature into a model of sleep self-regulation. Next, I highlight initial research in organizational psychology which has drawn from basic sleep physiology research. Following this, I generate new propositions linking sleep to work withdrawal, goal level, incivility, and defection in workplace social dilemmas. Finally, I close with a discussion of methods for conducting sleep research in organizational psychology, as well as some promising areas for future research.},

With a longitudinal sample of 179 teams at Time 1 and 154 teams at Time 2, the authors tested their predictions using a combined polynomial regression and response surface analyses approach. The results supported the authors’ predictions. When team managers and team members’ perceptions of organizational support were high and in agreement, outcomes were maximized. When team managers and team members disagreed, team negative affect increased and team performance and team positive affect decreased. The negative effects of disagreement were most amplified when managers perceived that the team received higher levels of support than did the team itself.},

A second sample of 130 undergraduate students was used to determine the relationships between the proactive scale and the ’Big Five‘ personality domains: neuroticism, extraversion, openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness. In a third sample of 148 MBA students, we assessed the proactive scale's relationships with three personality traits and three criterion measures. Consistent with hypotheses, scores on the proactive scale correlated with need for achievement, need for dominance, and independent measures of the nature of subjects' extracurricular and civic activities, the nature of their major personal achievements, and peer nominations of transformational leaders. We discuss the potential of the proactive construct to enhance our understanding of, and ability to predict, a wide range of behaviors.},

However, reputation fails across groups when the members of the groups cannot identify each other individually. Two mechanisms have been proposed in the literature to foster inter-group cooperation: collective sanctions and in-group policing. I use an agent-based model in an evolutionary environment to determine the effectiveness of these two mechanisms. Examining them separately, I find in-group policing results in high-levels of inter-group cooperation while collective sanctions do not. When employed concurrently, collective sanctions do nothing to enhance the effectiveness of the in-group policing mechanism and may impede its functioning.},

  abstract = {This article describes empirical and theoretical results from two multi-attribute sequential search tasks. In both tasks, the DM sequentially encounters options described by two attributes and must pay to learn the values of the attributes. In the continuous version of the task the DM learns the precise numerical value of an attribute when she pays to view it. In the threshold version the DM learns only whether the value of an attribute is above or below a threshold that she sets herself. Results from the continuous condition reveal that DMs tended to terminate their searches too early relative to the optimal policy. The pattern reversed in the threshold condition: DMs searched for too long. Maximum likelihood comparisons of two different stochastic decision models showed that DMs under both information conditions performed in ways consistent with the optimal policies. Those offered continuous-valued attribute information did not, however, spontaneously degrade this information into binary (acceptable/unacceptable) form, despite the theoretical finding that satisficing can be a very effective and efficient search strategy.},

  abstract = {Scholars who study negotiation increasingly recognize the importance of social context, seeing negotiations not merely as 1-shot interactions but as influenced by what came before. Under this longitudinal conceptualization of negotiation, a number of recent studies demonstrate that social psychological outcomes from prior negotiations are positively related to economic performance in subsequent negotiations when negotiating repeatedly with the same counterpart. In this report, we investigate a counterexample in the context of “sequential negotiations,” which we define as multiple negotiation sessions that occur within a short time frame but facing different counterparts in each session. We theorize, in sequential negotiations, that subjective value from 1 negotiation should be negatively related to objective outcomes in a subsequent negotiation because of spillover effects of incidental anger and pride. We test this model in 2 studies: a multiround lab study with a student sample and a longitudinal field study with employees negotiating as part of their jobs. Results from both studies support the hypothesized negative relationship between subjective value from an initial negotiation and the objective outcome from a subsequent negotiation with a different counterpart. The mediating role of pride is supported partially in Study 1 and fully in Study 2, whereas the mediating role of anger is not supported in either study. We discuss implications for negotiation theory and practice.},

The current study, however, explores the possibility that workplace social interactions, even if intended to be helpful, can sometimes be harmful. University employees (N ϭ 403) completed an online survey examining three types of potentially supportive interactions with other people in the workplace that might be harmful: Interactions that make the person focus on how stressful the workplace is, help that makes the recipient feel inadequate or incompetent, and help that is unwanted. Results suggest that these types of social interactions at work were indeed likely to be related to worse rather than to improved psychological and physical health. The most potentially harmful forms of these three social interactions were those that drew the person’s attention to stress in the workplace. These results indicate that in some instances social interactions, even if ostensibly helpful, may be harmful.},

  abstract = {Across the social sciences, lagged explanatory variables are a common strategy to confront challenges to causal identification using observational data. We show that “lag identification”—the use of lagged explanatory variables to solve endogeneity problems—is an illusion: lagging independent variables merely moves the channel through which endogeneity biases causal estimates, replacing a “selection on observables” assumption with an equally untestable “no dynamics among unobservables” assumption. We build our argument intuitively using directed acyclic graphs, then provide analytical results on the bias resulting from lag identification in a simple linear regression framework. We then present simulation results that characterize how, even under favorable conditions, lag identification leads to incorrect inferences. These findings have important implications for current practice among applied researchers in political science, economics, and related disciplines. We conclude by specifying the conditions under which lagged explanatory variables are appropriate for identifying causal effects.},

  abstract = {Substantial mean score differences and significant adverse impact have long motivated the question of whether cognitive ability tests are biased against certain non-White subgroups. This article presents a framework for understanding the interrelated issues of adverse impact and test bias, with particular focus on two forms of test bias especially relevant for personnel selection: differential validity and differential prediction. Ethical and legal reasons that organizations should be concerned about differential validity/prediction are discussed. This article also serves as a critical review of the research literature on differential validity/prediction. The general conclusion is that available evidence supports the existence of differential validity/prediction in the form of correlation/slope and intercept differences between White and non-White subgroups. Implications for individuals and organizations are outlined, and a future research agenda is proposed highlighting the need for new, better data; new, better methods of testing for differential validity/prediction; and investigation of substantive factors causing differential validity/prediction.},

Structural equation modeling results indicated that an increased need to belong and an increased need for popularity were associated with an increased use of Facebook. These relationships were mediated by FoMO. Increased FoMO was associated with increased stress related to Facebook use. These results emphasize the important role that FoMO plays in adolescents’ media use and well-being.},

The problem occurs in the context of automatic database design, when a tool is needed to assist the database designer in the process of specifying logical dependencies. The complexity of the dependency inference problem is inherently exponential. However, algorithms could be developed that perform well when the input relation has certain characteristics. We have implemented and optimized two recently proposed algorithms for dependency inference. An extensive set of experiments is presented, where dependencies were inferred from example relations with different cardinalities, number of attributes, and degree of normalization. We conclude that for practical example relations an adequate implementation of a dependency inference function leads to acceptable interactive response times.},

In this paper, we introduce a nomothetic perspective of job stress. The nomothetic perspective assumes that despite individual differences there will be consistencies in how groups of individuals perceive and respond to similar work environments. To contrast the individual and nomothetic perspectives, we analyzed data from 7,382 respondents from 99 groups. In the analyses, we examined individual-and group-level relationships using both real groups and randomly formed groups. The results revealed that respondents from the same work group agreed about perceptions of the work climate. The results also revealed that both individual and nomothetic perspectives were useful in describing the relationship between cohesion and psychological well-being. The relationship between work hours and psychological well-being, however, was best modeled from a nomothetic perspective.},

An understanding of the motivation underlying managers’ intention to accept such assignments would therefore be valuable. The purpose of this research was to examine relations between work attitudes and interest in international assignments. Three hundred and fifty Canadian managers responded to a questionnaire assessing their work attitudes as well as their interest in international assignments. It was found that specific facets of job satisfaction (company identification, satisfaction with co-workers, and satisfaction with financial rewards) were negatively related to interest in international assignments. It was also found that the relation between career satisfaction and interest in international assignments was moderated by managers’ general beliefs about such assignments. Finally, the results showed that expected satisfaction with specific job characteristics in a future job (opportunity to use competencies, to travel, and extrinsic rewards) were positively related to managers’ interest in international assignments. The findings are discussed in terms of their implications for human resource planning in global organizations making use of international assignments.},

  abstract = {The 10 year anniversary of the COGITO Study provides an opportunity to revisit the ideas behind the Cattell data box. Three dimensions of the persons × variables × time data box are discussed in the context of three categories of researchers each wanting to answer their own categorically different question. The example of the well-known speed-accuracy tradeoff is used to illustrate why these are three different categories of statistical question. The 200 persons by 100 variables by 100 occasions of measurement COGITO data cube presents a challenge to integrate theories and methods across the dimensions of the data box. A conceptual model is presented for the speed-accuracy tradeoff example that could account for cross-sectional between persons effects, short-term dynamics, and long-term learning effects. Thus, two fundamental differences between the time axis and the other two axes of the data box include ordering and time scaling. In addition, nonstationarity in human systems is a pervasive problem along the time dimension of the data box. To illustrate, the difference in nonstationarity between dancing and conversation is discussed in the context of the interaction between theory, methods, and data. An information theoretic argument is presented that the theory-methods-data interaction is better understood when viewed as a conversation than as a dance. Entropy changes in the development of a theory-methods-data conversation provide one metric for evaluating scientific progress.},

However, in light of recent work indicating that motivated behavior in organizations is often better understood using a within-person, longitudinal approach, we conceptualize citizenship performance as a dynamic cycle that varies over time. Specifically, we use self-regulation theory to explain how employees seek to fulfill goals through their OCBs, make plans to achieve those goals, engage in OCBs, and process feedback regarding their citizenship behavior. In doing so, we highlight the role played by chronic and working self-concept orientations. We also explore the way affective states influence self-regulation and citizenship, discuss unconscious or habitual acts of citizenship, and address the ways in which self-regulation and citizenship may vary over time.},

  abstract = {We investigate forgiveness as a human service employee coping response to client-instigated victimizations and further explore the role of workgroup conflict in (a) facilitating this response, and (b) influencing the relationship between victimization and workplace outcomes. Using the theoretical lens of Conservation of Resources (Hobfoll, 1989), we propose that employees forgive clients—especially in the context of low workgroup conflict. From low to moderate levels of client-instigated victimization, we suggest that victimization and forgiveness are positively related; however, this positive relationship does not prevail when individuals confront egregious levels of victimization (i.e., an inverted-U shape). This curvilinear relationship holds under low but not under high workgroup conflict. Extending this model to workplace outcomes, findings also demonstrate that the indirect effects of victimization on job satisfaction, burnout, and turnover intentions are mediated by forgiveness when workgroup conflict is low. Experiment- and field-based studies provide evidence for the theoretical model. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)},

The authors examined factors related to job change (i.e., voluntary turnover, prior job satisfaction) and newcomer experiences (i.e., fulfillment of commitments, extent of socialization) that may strengthen or weaken the job satisfaction pattern. Results of a study of 132 newcomers with data collected at 4 unique time periods show a complex curvilinear pattern of job satisfaction, such that satisfaction reached a peak following organizational entry and decreased thereafter. However, examination of moderating factors revealed that individuals who reported less satisfaction with their prior job and those having more positive experiences on the new job, such as greater fulfilled commitments and a higher degree of socialization, were most likely to experience this pattern. Findings from this study offer important implications for theory and research on changes in newcomer attitudes over time as well as practical insight on key factors that shape the pattern of job attitudes as individuals enter and experience a new workplace.},

The experiments show paradoxical effects whereby increased (decreased) control over the release of private information increases (decreases) willingness to publish sensitive information, even when the probability that strangers will access that information stays the same or increases (decreases).

  abstract = {Organizational scientists must capitalize on the big data revolution to better understand the nomothetic, idiographic, multilevel, and/or dynamic processes that make up today’s workplace. Simultaneously, researchers must collect high-quality data and be careful, diligent, and deliberate during data wrangling and data analysis so that all results can be replicated and all inferences are appropriate. Unfortunately, big data create many uncommon challenges during data acquisition and data wrangling that must be considered and overcome to fulfill the promise and potential of big data. Specifically, during acquisition, organizational scientists must become familiar with concepts like web scraping and databases, determine how to divide big data files into manageable chunks for cleaning and analysis, all while ensuring not to violate data usage rules and regulations. Likewise, once acquired, to effectively wrangle data so that they are ready for analysis researchers must be able to handle multiple file formats and data encoding standards, utilize a variety of software to visualize and diagnose data structure, and be adept at using functions and algorithms to determine variable structure and evaluate records and variables for missing or erroneous information. The current article provides a concise definition of big data and addresses each of these novel challenges and concepts related to big data acquisition and wrangling, specifically focusing on providing guidance and recommendations. Finally, a detailed big data example, team development using play-by-play basketball data, is provided. Each step of the process of scraping the data from the web as well as wrangling the multilevel big data into tidy data form is discussed, accompanied by a supplemental R file that contains all of the code necessary for researchers to replicate the described procedure.},

  abstract = {Organizational scientists increasingly focus on the dynamics of human behavior through longitudinal and event sampling methodologies. Random coefficient modeling such as hierarchical linear modeling and latent growth modeling is the dominant analytical method for longitudinal data. These models require that the covariance matrix of the errors is time invariant. Unfortunately, if unmeasured or unpredictable influences (i.e., unmeasured variables) consistently impact the dynamic process under investigation, the error term can become time-dependent. If random coefficient modeling is used to analyze data with time-dependent errors, then a serious inflation of Type I error rates, known as spurious regression, is observed. Monte Carlo simulation results from several common random coefficient models are presented to highlight the scope and severity of the problem, focusing on the potential mistaken inferences researchers can make. An analytic strategy is proposed to aid researchers in determining the underlying structure of the error covariance matrix, and alternative statistical techniques are given to analyze data that may contain a time-dependent error term.},

  abstract = {The importance of autonomy has been asserted by numerous writers in a variety of research domains, e.g., leadership, organizational climate, professionalism, and job design. In this paper, it is argued that research on job autonomy has been hindered by the way it has been conceptualized and operationalized by recent researchers. More specifically, it is suggested that the most commonly used measures of job autonomy operationally confound job autonomy with a conceptually distinct job characteristic (job interdependence/independence). Furthermore, it is suggested that for both theory development and improved organizational interventions it is important to distinguish separate areas (facets) of autonomy. This paper presents the development of a new instrument capable of tapping three distinct types, i.e., “Method A utonoly,” “Scheduling Autonomy,” and “Criteria Autonomy,” of work autonomy. Data relevant to the reliability and the validity of the instrument were gathered in two organizations. The results of several psychometric analyses suggest that the three work autonomy scales are both reliable and valid.},

Environments differ in the extent to which action-outcome contingencies are stable or volatile. Difficulty in being able to use this information to optimally update outcome predictions might contribute to the decision-making difficulties seen in anxiety. We tested this using an aversive learning task manipulating environmental volatility. Low trait anxious human participants matched updating of their outcome predictions to the volatility of the current environment, as predicted by a Bayesian model. High trait anxious individuals showed less ability to adjust updating of outcome expectancies between stable and volatile environments. This was linked to reduced sensitivity of the pupil dilatory response to volatility, potentially indicative of altered norepinephrinergic responsivity to changes in this aspect of environmental information.},

The current article reviews 3 popular approaches to the measurement of diversity: the simplistic majority–minority approach and 2 multiple categories variants, the generalized variance and the lesser used entropy statistic. We discuss the properties of each approach and reject the majority–minority approach. We provide 5 examples using the generalized variance and entropy statistics and illustrate their versatility and flexibility. We urge investigators to adopt these multicategory measures and to use our discussion to determine which measure of diversity is most appropriate given the nature of one’s data set and research question.},

Whereas previous research has examined the determinants of this prediction bias, the present research explored potential consequences for behavior. In particular, we examined whether and when task completion predictions influence actual completion times. In four experiments we used anchoring manipulations to induce participants to make relatively early or late task completion predictions, and then examined when they started and/or finished the target tasks. As hypothesized, the prediction manipulation influenced completion times under certain conditions defined by the nature of the target task. Manipulated predictions affected completion times of closed tasks, defined as tasks carried out within a single, continuous session but not of open tasks, defined as tasks requiring multiple work sessions. This implies that task completion predictions help to initiate action, but their impact diminishes over the course of extensive, multi-stage projects.},

  abstract = {To understand within-person psychological processes, one may fit VAR(1) models (or continuous-time variants thereof) to multivariate time series and display the VAR(1) coefficients as a network. This approach has two major problems. First, the contemporaneous correlations between the variables will frequently be substantial, yielding multicollinearity issues. In addition, the shared effects of the variables are not included in the network. Consequently, VAR(1) networks can be hard to interpret. Second, crossvalidation results show that the highly parametrized VAR(1) model is prone to overfitting. In this article, we compare the pros and cons of two potential solutions to both problems. The first is to impose a lasso penalty on the VAR(1) coefficients, setting some of them to zero. The second, which has not yet been pursued in psychological network analysis, uses principal component VAR(1) (termed PC-VAR(1)). In this approach, the variables are first reduced to a few principal components, which are rotated toward simple structure; then VAR(1) analysis (or a continuoustime analog) is applied to the rotated components. Reanalyzing the data of a single participant of the COGITO study, we show that PC-VAR(1) has the better predictive performance and that networks based on PC-VAR(1) clearly represent both the lagged and the contemporaneous variable relations.},

The change process is often in the direction of tightening a loosely coupled system but not always. Thus the intent is more exploratory than necessarily directional. Social network analysis is a popular and useful tool for understanding a loosely coupled system and serves the consulting process both diagnostically and as an intervention. A network is a common example of a loosely coupled system. There are two primary forms of network—external and internal. External networks are typically stand-alone organizations such as the Organization Development Network and internal networks are best understood as the informal organization within a large and probably highly bureaucratic system. Regarding change the objectives are different depending on which kind of network is being addressed. Other interventions that are appropriate for consulting with a loosely coupled system include large group, for example, search conference and the parallel organization. Using Weick’s processes as a guide for changing a loosely coupled system suggestions for how to conduct such consultation are provided. Conclusions include a brief exploration on power and an admonition to redress the imbalance between what we know about changing tightly coupled systems and what we do not know about changing loosely coupled systems.},

  abstract = {The aim of the present study is to select a set of higher order spectral features for emotion/stress recognition system. 50 Bispectral (28 features) and Bicoherence (22 features) based higher order spectral features were extracted from speech signal and its glottal waveform. These features were combined with Inter-Speech 2010 features to further improve the recognition rates. Feature subset selection (FSS) was carried out in this proposed work with the objective of maximizing emotion recognition rate for subject independent with minimum features. The FSS contains two stages: Multi-cluster feature selection was adopted in Stage 1 to reduce feature space and identify relevant feature subset from Interspeech 2010 features. In Stage 2, Biogeography based optimization (BBO), Particle swarm optimization (PSO) and proposed BBO\_PSO Hybrid optimization were performed to further reduce the dimension of feature space and identify the most relevant feature subset, which has higher discrimination ability to distinguish different emotional states. The proposed method was tested in three different databases: Berlin emotional speech database (BES), Surrey audio-visual expressed emotion database (SAVEE) and Speech under simulated and actual stress (SUSAS) simulated domain. The proposed feature set was evaluated with subject independent (SI), subject dependent (SD), gender dependent male (GD-male), gender dependent female (GD-female), text independent pairwise speech (TIDPS), and text independent multi-style speech (TIDMSS) experiments by using SVM and ELM classifiers. From the results obtained, it is evident that the proposed method attained accuracies of 93.25\% (SI), 100\% (SD), 93.75\% (GD-male), and 97.58\% (GD-female) for BES; 62.38\% (SI) and 76.19\% (SD) for SAVEE; and 90.09\% (TIDMSS), 97.04\% (TIDPS − Angry vs. Neutral), 98.89\% (TIDPS − Lombard vs. Neutral), 99.07\% (TIDPS − Loud vs. Neutral) for SUSAS.},

  abstract = {Stars— employees with disproportionately high and prolonged (a) performance, (b) visibility, and (c) relevant social capital— have garnered attention in economics, sociology, and management. However, star research is often isolated within these research disciplines. Thus, 3 distinct star research streams are evolving, each disconnected from the others and each bringing siloed theoretical perspectives, terms, and assumptions. A conceptual review of these perspectives reveals a focus on the expost effects that stars exert in organizations with little explanation of who a star is and how one becomes a star. To synthesize the stars literature across these 3 disciplines, we apply psychological theories, specifically motivation theories, to create an integrative framework for stars research. Thus, we present a unified stars definition and extend theory on the making, managing, and mobility of stars. We extend research about how and why employees may be motivated to become stars, how best to manage stars and their relationships with colleagues, and how to motivate star retention. We then outline directions for future research.},

In this review, alternative specifications for the definition and latent structure of individual performance are reviewed and summarized. Setting aside differences in terminology, the alternatives are remarkably similar. The Campbell (2012) model is offered as a synthesized description of the content of the latent structure. Issues pertaining to performance dynamics are then reviewed, along with the role played by individual adaptability to changing performance requirements. Using the synthesized model of the latent content structure and dynamics of performance as a backdrop, issues pertaining to the assessment of performance are summarized. The alternative goals of performance assessment, general measurement issues, and the construct validity of specific methods (e.g., ratings, simulations) are reviewed and described. Cross-cultural issues and future research needs are noted.},

Campion and Matthew H. Reider were originally incorrect. All versions of this article have been corrected.] Emerging advancements including the exponentially growing availability of computer-collected data and increasingly sophisticated statistical software have led to a “Big Data Movement” wherein organizations have begun attempting to use large-scale data analysis to improve their effectiveness. Yet, little is known regarding how organizations can leverage these advancements to develop more effective personnel selection procedures, especially when the data are unstructured (text-based). Drawing on literature on natural language processing, we critically examine the possibility of leveraging advances in text mining and predictive modeling computer software programs as a surrogate for human raters in a selection context. We explain how to “train” a computer program to emulate a human rater when scoring accomplishment records. We then examine the reliability of the computer’s scores, provide preliminary evidence of their construct validity, demonstrate that this practice does not produce scores that disadvantage minority groups, illustrate the positive financial impact of adopting this practice in an organization (N ∼ 46,000 candidates), and discuss implementation issues. Finally, we discuss the potential implications of using computer scoring to address the adverse impact-validity dilemma. We suggest that it may provide a cost-effective means of using predictors that have comparable validity but have previously been too expensive for large-scale screening.

Instead, groupings of tasks into jobs suggested simple cognitive categorization based on task similarity, reflecting an engineering (or work simplification) orientation. Second, can job design be predicted from task design? Separate measures for job and task designs were unrelated, indicating that the whole is not predictable from the parts in job design, Third, can job design principles be trained?

  abstract = {One aim in the analysis of pedigree data may be to infer the mode of inheritance of a characteristic. If only “interesting” pedigrees are analysed, the ascertainment bias may lead to some modes of inheritance being unintentionally preferred. Also, it is clearly most efficient in attempting to make such inferences, if a decision on whether to continue sampling a pedigree is made conditional on the types of individuals who have been observed; an a priori decision to examine 500 members of a pedigree may lead to much wasted effort, since the pedigree may prove to be largely uninformative. The present paper shows that provided all observed families are included in the analysis, even those which appeared “uninteresting” or “sporadic” and were not sampled further, and provided a decision to continue sampling is made conditional on types observed up to that point, the correct likelihood for the mode of inheritance may be easily computed. This opens the way for a more detailed study of the wider problem of optimal sampling rules on pedigrees.},

Several extensions of the basic LAMMA are considered, including artifact correction, multiple effect sizes from studies, and incorporating age as a predictor.

This alternative does not require small group size, complex coordinated punishing activities, or implausible informational assumptions. An experimental public goods game provides evidence for the behavioral relevance of strong reciprocity and how it differs from unconditional altruism.},

Our goal is to advance this domain through an integrative conceptual review. We begin by answering the question of why–Why adopt a network approach to study leadership? Then, we offer a framework for organizing prior research. Our review reveals 3 areas of research, which we term: (a) leadership in networks, (b) leadership as networks, and (c) leadership in and as networks. By clarifying the conceptual underpinnings, key findings, and themes within each area, this review serves as a foundation for future inquiry that capitalizes on, and programmatically builds upon, the insights of prior work. Our final contribution is to advance an agenda for future research that harnesses the confluent ideas at the intersection of leadership in and as networks. Leadership in and as networks represents a paradigm shift in leadership research–from an emphasis on the static traits and behaviors of formal leaders whose actions are contingent upon situational constraints, toward an emphasis on the complex and patterned relational processes that interact with the embedding social context to jointly constitute leadership emergence and effectiveness.},

  abstract = {Job satisfaction researchers typically assume a tripartite model, suggesting evaluations of the job are explained by latent cognitive and affective factors. However, in the attitudes literature, connectionist theorists view attitudes as emergent structures resulting from the mutually reinforcing causal force of interacting cognitive evaluations. Recently, the causal attitudes network (CAN; Dalege et al., 2016) model was proposed as an integration of both these perspectives with network theory. Here, we describe the CAN model and its implications for understanding job satisfaction. We extend the existing literature by drawing from both attitude and network theory. Using multiple data sets and measures of job satisfaction, we test these ideas empirically. First, drawing on the functional approach to attitudes, we show the instrumental-symbolic distinction in attitude objects is evident in job satisfaction networks. Specifically, networks for more instrumental features (e.g., pay) show stable, high connectivity and form a single cluster, whereas networks regarding symbolic features (e.g., supervisor) increase in connectivity with exposure (i.e., job tenure) and form clusters based on valence and cognitive-affective distinction. We show these distinctions result in “small-world” networks for symbolic features wherein affective reactions are more central than cognitive reactions, consistent with the affective primacy hypothesis. We show the practical advantage of CAN by demonstrating in longitudinal data that items with high centrality are more likely to affect change throughout the attitude network, and that network models are better able to predict future voluntary turnover compared with structural equation models. Implications of this exciting new model for research and practice are discussed.},

From smartphone profiling apps to workplace big data, the digital revolution has produced a wide range of new tools for making quick and cheap inferences about human potential and predicting future work performance. However, academic industrial-organizational (I-O) psychologists appear to be mostly spectators. Indeed, there is little scientific research on innovative assessment methods, leaving human resources (HR) practitioners with no credible evidence to evaluate the utility of such tools. To this end, this article provides an overview of new talent identification tools, using traditional workplace assessment methods as the organizing framework for classifying and evaluating new tools, which are largely technologically enhanced versions of traditional methods. We highlight some opportunities and challenges for I-O psychology practitioners interested in exploring and improving these innovations.},

  abstract = {A new model of adaptability, the diversified portfolio model (DPM) of adaptability, is introduced. In the 1950s, Markowitz developed the financial portfolio model by demonstrating that investors could optimize the ratio of risk and return on their portfolios through risk diversification. The DPM integrates attractive features of a variety of models of adaptability, including Linville’s self-complexity model, the risk and resilience model, and Bandura’s social cognitive theory. The DPM draws on the concept of portfolio diversification, positing that diversified investment in multiple life experiences, life roles, and relationships promotes positive adaptation to life’s challenges. The DPM provides a new integrative model of adaptability across the biopsychosocial levels of functioning. More importantly, the DPM addresses a gap in the literature by illuminating the antecedents of adaptive processes studied in a broad array of psychological models. The DPM is described in relation to the biopsychosocial model and propositions are offered regarding its utility in increasing adaptiveness. Recommendations for future research are also offered.

Drawing from prior team reflexivity research, we propose that reflexivity-related team processes reduce demands, and enhance control and support. Given the centrality of these factors to work-based strain, we posit that team reflexivity, by affecting these factors, may have beneficial implications on 3 core dimensions of employee burnout, namely exhaustion, cynicism, and inefficacy (reduced personal accomplishment). Using a sample of 469 unskilled manufacturing workers employed in 73 production teams in a Southern Chinese factory, we implemented a time lagged, quasi-field experiment, with half of the teams trained in and executing an end-of-shift team debriefing, and the other half assigned to a control condition and undergoing periodic postshift team-building exercises. Our findings largely supported our hypotheses, demonstrating that relative to team members assigned to the control condition, those assigned to the reflexivity condition experienced a significant improvement in all 3 burnout dimensions over time. These effects were mediated by control and support (but not demands) and amplified as a function of team longevity.},

Employing a dynamic analysis of national panel data over ten waves in Australia, the study examines the intertemporal effects of lagged and current eldercare on subjective wellbeing, including general life and job satisfaction, satisfaction with free time, employment opportunities, work-life balance, job security, pay and work hours. When the effects are statistically significant, eldercare provision tends to have a positive impact on employees’ subjective wellbeing, while eldercare intensity, as measured by the number of caring hours, has a negative impact. Our results also suggest the effects are heterogeneous across genders, part-time and full-time workers, and blue-collar and white-collar occupations.},

  abstract = {A basic tenet of research on organizational citizenship behaviour (OCB) is that OCB aggregated across individuals improves organizational performance. Departing from the typical focus on individual-level OCB, the construct of group-level OCB (GOCB) recently emerged as a critical group function that affects various group effectiveness measures. Despite the clear link between GOCB and team performance, the existing literature provides a limited understanding with regard to the antecedents of GOCB, mostly focusing on leadership variables. Establishing helping behaviour (a core dimension of OCB) as a collective construct, this study substantially expands the antecedents of group-level helping, and empirically tests their effects using three different operationalizations of group-level helping. The results, based on a sample of 96 work units, show that membership diversity in gender and education decreased group-level helping, whereas diversity in tenure increased it. Group-level helping was also positively related to leadership characteristics (supportive unit manager, transformational top management) and perceived competence of unit members. In addition, the analysis further indicated that perceived competence is a positive predictor of group-level helping only when the unit members also believe that others are trustworthy in terms of integrity and benevolent motivation. From a methodological standpoint, the study provides important insights by comparing different ways of operationalizing collective constructs.},

Our paper revisits this research problem by drawing on complementarity theory from Economics. The empirical segment of our work is based on data on KM strategies and organizational performance from a sample of 131 Korean firms. Our results suggest three types of relationship among KM strategies: non-complementarity, and non-critical symmetric complementarity, and asymmetric complementarity. Integrating explicit-oriented with tacit-oriented KM strategies showed non-complementarity, which suggests a drag on obtaining higher levels of organizational performance. Our analysis of KM strategies based on KM source shows that companies could benefit from KM by implementing external-oriented or internaloriented strategy. Combining the tacit-internal-oriented and explicit-external-oriented KM strategies indicates a complementarity relationship, which implies synergistic effects of KM strategies on performance.},

It was hypothesized that the positive or motivating effects of job complexity are only realized when workers are given enough autonomy to effectively meet the challenges of complex jobs. Results show that not only do job complexity and job autonomy interact, but that the relationships to the outcome variables are curvilinear in form. Job complexity is shown to be both a motivator and a stressor when job autonomy is low. However, the most beneficial effects of job complexity occur when it is matched by a high level of job autonomy. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

This contrast or assimilation phenomena can explain the exaggeration of differences among computational simulation scholars.

They lack systematic and efficient ways of incorporating behavioral observations that are strong indicators of psychological disorder, much of which may occur outside the awareness of either individual. We compared clinical diagnosis of major depression with automatically measured facial actions and vocal prosody in patients undergoing treatment for depression. Manual FACS coding, active appearance modeling (AAM) and pitch extraction were used to measure facial and vocal expression. Classifiers using leave-one-out validation were SVM for FACS and for AAM and logistic regression for voice. Both face and voice demonstrated moderate concurrent validity with depression. Accuracy in detecting depression was 88\% for manual FACS and 79\% for AAM. Accuracy for vocal prosody was 79\%. These findings suggest the feasibility of automatic detection of depression, raise new issues in automated facial image analysis and machine learning, and have exciting implications for clinical theory and practice.},

Interest in this topic has grown steadily since the watershed Harris volume (1963) and has been reflected in other books such as Collins \& Horn (1991), Collins \& Sayer (2001), Gottman (1995), Nagin (2005), Nesselroade \& Baltes (1979), Singer \& Willett (2003a), and von Eye (1990a,b), as well as in countless journal articles. Computing resources are becoming increasingly powerful, and readily available specialized software enables scientists to apply new and highly sophisticated statistical analyses in their work. Some rich longitudinal data sets have been archived and are available to the scientific public for statistical analysis. Further, creative use of new technology, such as handheld computers and other devices, is making collection of longitudinal data characterized by more frequent and intense measurement increasingly feasible (e.g., Shiffman \& Stone 2006, Walls \& Schafer 2006).},

  abstract = {This article explores the impact of the temporal design, i.e. the sampling of times of measurement, on the statistical and substantive conclusions drawn from longitudinal biomedical and social science research. It is shown that for a study of a given duration, if observations are spaced too far apart the resulting data can support misleading conclusions, whereas if observations are spaced relatively close together, a much more veridical picture of the process of interest is provided. The application of these ideas in several areas is discussed, including correlation and regression analysis where a variable measured at one time is used to predict a variable measured at a later time; growth curve analyses; and analyses involving stage-sequential processes. We argue that longitudinal designs should relate the choice of timing and spacing of observations in longitudinal studies to characteristics of the processes being measured. In addition, consideration of the possible effects of measurement design on results of statistical analyses may aid in their interpretation. New approaches involving intensive data collection with much shorter measurement intervals, such as Ecological Momentary Assessment, are promising, but are costly and are not suitable for every research question. More information is needed to help guide researchers in their choice of temporal design. \# 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In the article, the first sentence in the caption for Figure 4 should have been: “Definitional correspondence levels for organization sample (n = 122).” All versions of this article have been corrected.] Although social exchange theory has become one of the most oft-evoked theories in industrial and organizational psychology, there remains no consensus about how to measure its key mechanism: social exchange relationships (Blau, 1964). Drawing on Cropanzano and Byrne’s (2000) review of contemporary social exchange theorizing, we examined the content validity of perceived support, exchange quality, affective commitment, trust, and psychological contract fulfillment as indicators of social exchange relationships. We used Hinkin and Tracey’s (1999) quantitative approach to content validation, which asks participants to rate the correspondence between scale items and definitions of intended (and unintended) constructs. Our results revealed that some of the most frequently utilized indicators of social exchange relationships—perceived support and exchange quality—were significantly less content valid than rarely used options like affect-based trust. Our results also revealed that 2 direct measures—Bernerth, Armenakis, Feild, Giles, and Walker’s (2007) scale and a scale created for this study—were content valid. We discuss the implications of these results for future applications of social exchange theory. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)},

In this article we                 present the APIM as a general, longitudinal model for measuring bidirectional                 effects in interpersonal relationships. We also present three different approaches                 to testing the model. The statistical analysis of the APIM is illustrated using                 longitudinal data on relationship specific attachment security from 203                 mother–adolescent dyads. The results support the view that interpersonal                 influence on attachment security is bidirectional. Moreover, consistent with a                 hypothesis from attachment theory, the degree to which a child’s                 attachment security is influenced by his or her primary caregiver is found to                 diminish with age.},

This synthesis of past evidence provides the foundation for reviewing the present emerging and developing themes in psychological contract research. This discussion is organized around the expansion of resources exchanged and the antecedents of contract breach and outcomes, moving beyond reciprocity as an underpinning explanation. We highlight the practical implications of research to date on psychological contracts and end with directions for future research to include the need for greater attention given to ideological currency, employee health, polycontextual approaches, the role of psychological needs, and post-breach/violation.},

  abstract = {Longitudinal models are becoming increasingly prevalent in the behavioral sciences, with key advantages including increased power, more comprehensive measurement, and establishment of temporal precedence. One particularly salient strength offered by longitudinal data is the ability to disaggregate between-person and within-person effects in the regression of an outcome on a timevarying covariate. However, the ability to disaggregate these effects has not been fully capitalized upon in many social science research applications. Two likely reasons for this omission are the general lack of discussion of disaggregating effects in the substantive literature and the need to overcome several remaining analytic challenges that limit existing quantitative methods used to isolate these effects in practice. This review explores both substantive and quantitative issues related to the disaggregation of effects over time, with a particular emphasis placed on the multilevel model. Existing analytic methods are reviewed, a general approach to the problem is proposed, and both the existing and proposed methods are demonstrated using several artificial data sets. Potential limitations and directions for future research are discussed, and recommendations for the disaggregation of effects in practice are offered.},

  abstract = {Objective: Although recent statistical and computational developments allow for the empirical testing of psychological theories in ways not previously possible, one particularly vexing challenge remains: how to optimally model the prospective, reciprocal relations between 2 constructs as they developmentally unfold over time. Several analytic methods currently exist that attempt to model these types of relations, and each approach is successful to varying degrees. However, none provide the unambiguous separation over time of between-person and within-person components of stability and change, components that are often hypothesized to exist in the psychological sciences. Our goal in this article is to propose and demonstrate a novel extension of the multivariate latent curve model to allow for the disaggregation of these effects. Method: We begin with a review of the standard latent curve models and describe how these primarily capture between-person differences in change. We then extend this model to allow for regression structures among the time-specific residuals to capture within-person differences in change. Results: We demonstrate this model using an artificial data set generated to mimic the developmental relation between alcohol use and depressive symptomatology spanning 5 repeated measures. Conclusions: We obtain a specificity of results from the proposed analytic strategy that is not available from other existing methodologies. We conclude with potential limitations of our approach and directions for future research.},

This data set permits analyses that disentangle the effects of predictor-score age and timing of criterion measurements on validity degradation. We investigate the extent to which validity degradation is explained by criterion dynamism versus the limited shelf-life of ability scores. We also explore whether validity degradation is attributable to fluctuations in criterion variability over time and/or GPA contamination from individual differences in course-taking patterns. Analyses of multiyear predictor data suggest that changes to the determinants of performance over time have much stronger effects on validity degradation than does the shelf-life of cognitive test scores. The age of predictor scores had only a modest relationship with criterion-related validity when the criterion measurement occasion was held constant. Practical implications and recommendations for future research are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)},

Historically, researchers have had to rely on range-restriction corrections that only make use of range-restriction information for one variable, but it is not uncommon for researchers to have such information for both variables in a correlation (e.g., when studying the correlation between two predictor variables). However, existing meta-analytic methods incorporating these corrections overlook their unique implications for estimating the sampling variance of corrected correlations and for accurately assigning weights to studies in individual-correction meta-analyses. We introduce new methods for computing individual-correction and artifact-distribution meta-analyses using the bivariate indirect range-restriction (BVIRR; “Case V”) correction and describe improved methods for applying BVIRR corrections that substantially reduce bias in parameter estimation. We illustrate the effectiveness of these methods in a large-scale simulation and in meta-analyses of expatriate data. We provide R code to implement the methods described in this article; more comprehensive and robust functions for applying these methods are available in the psychmeta package for R (Dahlke \& Wiernik, 2018, 2017/2019).},

The former may include the opportunity cost of continued testing, and the latter may include the cost of customer dissatisfaction and of fixing faults found in the field. Exact stopping rules were obtained by the authors, in a previous paper 111, under the assumption that the distribution of the fault finding rate is known. Here we consider two important variants where the fault finding distribution is not completely known. They are: i) the distribution is exponential with unknown mean, and ii) the distribution is locally exponential with rate changing smoothly over time. We present new procedures for both cases. In case i) we also show how to incorporate information from related projects and subjective inputs. We propose several new graphical procedures which are easy to implement, and we illustrate these for data from a large telecommunications software system.},

The general hypothesis is that group technology/structural fit is a better predictor of work group performance than either technology or structure alone. Related hypotheses match three technology variables (task predictability, problem analyzability, and interdependence) with three group structural variables (horizontal differentiation, vertical differentiation, and connectedness) to predict group performance. Technology/structural fit variables in this study are significant predictors of group performance, as are group structural properties alone. Technology variables are very poor predictors alone. The fit variables add significant explained variance over and above the technology and structural variables as universalistic predictors. Predictions about which technology and structural variables to match for higher group performance are generally supported. These results could allow future contingency research to make greater contributions to theory building about group performance. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Several special circumstances with regard to leadership are first considered, including the varied domains in which leadership is relevant, its multilevel nature, the multiple sources of origin for leadership, and the multiple outcomes in terms of leader emergence and effectiveness. Various leadership theories and frameworks are then reviewed, organized around classical theories (evolutionary, trait, behavior, and contingency), bridging theories (charismatic/transformational, leader-member exchange, and leadership perceptions), and emerging approaches (team, shared, and capacity approaches). Future directions in terms of leadership theory, research, and practice are proposed, concluding with a summary of what I-O psychologists know about leadership and speculation as to what has yet to be learned.},

They also investigated whether the obtained Pareto-optimal composites continue to perform well under variability of the selection parameters that characterize the intended selection decision. The results of this investigation indicate that this is indeed the case. The authors suggest that the procedure be used as one of a number of potential strategies for addressing the quality-adverse impact problem in settings where estimates of the selection parameters (e.g., validity estimates, predictor intercorrelations, subgroup mean differences on the predictors and criteria) are available from either a local validation study or meta-analytic research.

This resource-based perspective extends and complements the dominant social exchange perspective which views employee reactions to psychological contract violation as targeting the source of the violation—the organization. The present article reports on 3 studies. Study 1 conducted an experiment with 109 participants and established the main effect of psychological contract violation on resource depletion. Study 2, using survey data from 315 medical employees and their immediate supervisors, found that after controlling for the social exchange mechanism (i.e., revenge cognitions toward the organization), resource depletion mediated the indirect effects of psychological contract violation on supervisory reports of employees’ interpersonal harming toward coworkers and decision-making vigilance for clients. Further, we found that organizational and professional identification played opposing moderating roles in the effects of violation on resource depletion and consequently behavioral outcomes, such that these mediated relationships were stronger when organizational identification was high, and weaker when professional identification was high. Study 3 replicated all the results obtained in Studies 1 and 2 with time-lagged data from 229 medical employees across 3 measurement points. The findings confirm that resource depletion is a more effective explanation of the consequences of violation on third parties than revenge cognitions, although both are useful in predicting organization-directed outcomes (i.e., civic virtue and organizational rule compliance).

Such propensities are characteristically attributed to individual, organizational, and cultural traits such as risk aversion, uncertainty-avoidance, discounting, and an unwillingness to change. This paper explores an alternative interpretation of such phenomena.

In particular, learning and selection are biased against both risky and novel alternatives. Because the biases are products of the tendency to reproduce success that is inherent in the sequential sampling of adaptation, they are reduced whenever the reproduction of success is attenuated. In particular, when adaptation is slowed, made imprecise, or recalled less reliably, the propensity to engage in risky and new activities is increased.

The authors propose a different explanation that assumes the attitudes of others influence only the activities and objects individuals are exposed to. For example, individuals are likely to be exposed to activities that their friends enjoy. The authors demonstrate that such influence over sampling behavior is sufficient to produce a social influence effect when individuals form attitudes by learning from experience. Even if the experiences of 2 individuals, when they sample an object or event, are independent random variables, their attitudes will become positively correlated if their sampling processes are interdependent. Interdependent sampling of activities thus provides a different explanation of social influence with distinct empirical and theoretical implications.},

  abstract = {Performance sampling models of duration dependence in employee turnover and firm exit predict that hazard rates will initially be low, gradually rise to a maximum, and then fall. Some empirical duration distributions have bimodal hazard rates, however. In this paper, we present a generalization of the performance sampling model that can account for such deviations from unimodality. While the standard model of performance sampling assumes that the mean and the standard deviation of performance are constant over time, we allow them to change in time, to reflect the fact that tasks may change over time. We derive the hazard rate implied by this more general model and show that it can be bimodal. Using data on turnover in law firms, we show that the hazard rate predicted by these models fit data better than existing models.},

This article shows that behavior consistent with an S-shaped value function could be an implication of rational inferences about the expected values of alternatives. Theoretically, I demonstrate that even a risk-neutral Bayesian decision maker, who is uncertain about the reliability of observations, should use variability in observed outcomes as a predictor of low expected value for outcomes above a reference level, and as a predictor of high expected value for outcomes below a reference level. Empirically, I show that combining past outcomes using an S-shaped value function leads to accurate predictions about future values. The theory also offers a rationale for why risk sensitivity consistent with an inverse S-shaped value function should occur in experiments on decisions from experience with binary payoff distributions.

  abstract = {Organizations learn from other organizations. However, the observations available to them are typically a biased sample. The organizations that can be observed at any point in time are the survivors of a selective process that has eliminated a large fraction of the underlying population. In addition, there is a strong tendency to focus on successful organizations in books and the business press. As a result, the available sample of organizations usually undersamples failure. This paper shows that such undersampling of failure can contribute to a variety of false beliefs about effective management. Simply by observing existing organizations, laymen may get a misleading picture of the determinants of corporate performance. In particular, risky practices, even if they are unrelated to performance in the full population of organizations, may seem to be positively related to performance in a sample of survivors. I argue that this bias frequently implies that the organizational theories of managers and other observers of organizations will be systematically biased. Observations of existing organizations will show that unreliable, uninformed practices and practices that involve concentrated resource allocation are superior to reliable, informed practices or practices that involve diversified resource allocation. I show that this implies that observations of existing organizations will produce compelling but potentially misleading evidence for the significance several common managerial practices.},

This result occurs in a simple model in which performance is not frequency dependent, there are no delayed effects, and skill is unrelated to risk-taking. The performance of an agent in any given period equals a skill component plus a noise term. We show that the average skill of survivors eventually decreases when the noise terms in consecutive periods are dependent and drawn from a distribution with a “long” tail—a sub-class of heavy-tailed distributions. This result occurs because only agents with extremely high level of performance survive many periods, and extreme performance is not diagnostic of high skill when the noise term is drawn from a long-tailed distribution.},

  abstract = {Individuals are typically more likely to continue to interact with people if they have a positive impression of them. This article shows how this sequential sampling feature of impression formation can explain several biases in impression formation. The underlying mechanism is the sample bias generated when the probability of interaction depends on current impressions. Because negative experiences decrease the probability of interaction, negative initial impressions are more stable than positive impressions. Negative initial impressions, however, are more likely to change for individuals who are frequently exposed to others. As a result, systematic differences in interaction patterns, due to social similarity or proximity, will produce systematic differences in impressions. This mechanism suggests an alternative explanation of several regularities in impression formation, including a negativity bias in impressions of outgroup members, systematic differences in performance evaluations, and more positive evaluations of proximate others.},

  abstract = {At some point, hiring managers in all organizations face the decision of whether to fill open positions with internal candidates (e.g., through promotions) or to hire external candidates (e.g., from competitors or new entrants into the labor market). Despite this ubiquitous choice, surprisingly little research has compared the effectiveness of internal and external selection or has identified situations in which 1 approach may be better than the other. The authors use theory on human capital resources to predict differences between internal and external hires on manager- and unit-level outcomes. Analysis of data from a quick-service retail organization (N = 3,697) suggested that internally hired managers demonstrated higher levels of individual job performance and commanded lower starting salaries than externally hired managers. At the unit-level, operations led by internal hires demonstrated higher performance on organization-specific criteria (i.e., service performance), whereas no internal–external differences were found on more general criteria (i.e., financial performance). They also found some evidence that differences in unit service performance decreased over time (but did not diminish completely) as external hires improved at a slightly faster rate than internal hires. Overall, these findings underscore the complexity of the recurring “build or buy” decision. The results also suggest that internal hires generally outperform external hires, both individually and collectively, and they do so for less money.

  abstract = {It is common for organizations to hire workers based on their knowledge, skills, and abilities. However, despite capable workers being hired, productivity may suffer if employees’ motivational needs are not satisfied. We developed an agent-based model to simulate the completion of tasks by teams of workers in an organization. Each worker is described by an ability value and a 3-parameter motive profile expressing the individual’s needs for affiliation, achievement, and power. During each time step, each worker contributes to an assigned task at a rate determined by the worker’s ability and motive profile, the task’s difficulty and proximity to completion, and the team’s experience. When a task is completed by a team, the workers are re-assigned to a new team and task. At the end of 365 time steps, the model outputs the total number of completed tasks, which is the primary measurement of productivity. Model simulations demonstrate that hiring workers based on their ability and motivational strengths can lead to increased productivity. Additional model simulations illustrate the benefit of identifying failing tasks and re-assigning new teams to these tasks in real-time.},

Previous research, however, has almost exclusively emphasized the beneficial outcomes of job crafting. In the current study, we proposed dysfunctional consequences of crafting for performance-related outcomes in the form of a U-shaped relationship between job crafting and performance effectiveness (managerial ratings of job proficiency and peer ratings of citizenship behavior). We further predicted that elements of the task context (autonomy and ambiguity) and the social context (interdependence and social support) moderate these curvilinear relationships. Consistent with previous research, job crafting displayed positive and linear effects on work-related attitudes (job satisfaction and affective commitment). Consistent with our predictions, moderate levels of crafting were associated with dysfunctional performance-related outcomes and features of work context either exacerbated or dissipated these dysfunctional consequences of job crafting for individuals.},

In this paper, I develop goal sampling theory (GST) to appease these criticisms and extend our understanding of goal choices beyond momentary preferences and into dynamic updating and sampling behavior across time. GST draws from temporal motivational theory, sampling models of impression formation, and organizational theory on how the environment constrains behavior and situates aspects of each into a formal model of goal sampling. Doing so addresses the limitations of our prior thinking, introduces new concepts and predictions, and provides a mathematical framework that lends itself to computational modeling.},

  abstract = {We introduce ctsem, an R package for continuous time structural equation modeling of panel (N {$>$} 1) and time series (N = 1) data, using full information maximum likelihood. Most dynamic models (e.g., cross-lagged panel models) in the social and behavioural sciences are discrete time models. An assumption of discrete time models is that time intervals between measurements are equal, and that all subjects were assessed at the same intervals. Violations of this assumption are often ignored due to the difficulty of accounting for varying time intervals, therefore parameter estimates can be biased and the time course of effects becomes ambiguous. By using stochastic differential equations to estimate an underlying continuous process, continuous time models allow for any pattern of measurement occasions. By interfacing to OpenMx, ctsem combines the flexible specification of structural equation models with the enhanced data gathering opportunities and improved estimation of continuous time models. ctsem can estimate relationships over time for multiple latent processes, measured by multiple noisy indicators with varying time intervals between observations. Within and between effects are estimated simultaneously by modeling both observed covariates and unobserved heterogeneity. Exogenous shocks with different shapes, group differences, higher order diffusion effects and oscillating processes can all be simply modeled. We first introduce and define continuous time models, then show how to specify and estimate a range of continuous time models using ctsem.},

  abstract = {Despite decades of theory and empirical research on employee burnout, its temporal and developmental aspects are still not fully understood. This lack of understanding is problematic because burnout is a dynamic phenomenon and burnout interventions may be improved by a greater understanding of who is likely to experience changes in burnout and when these changes occur. In this article, we advance existing burnout theory by articulating how the 3 burnout dimensions should differ in their pattern of change over time as a result of career transition type: organizational newcomers, internal job changers (e.g., promotions or lateral moves), and organizational insiders (i.e., job incumbents). We tested our model in a broad sample of 2,089 health care employees, with 5 measurement points over 2 years. Using random coefficient modeling, we found that burnout was relatively stable for organizational insiders but slightly dynamic for organizational newcomers and internal job changers. We also found that the dimensions of emotional exhaustion and depersonalization were more sensitive to career transition type than reduced personal accomplishment. Finding some differences among different types of employees as well as the dimensions of burnout may begin to explain longstanding inconsistencies between theory and research regarding the dynamics of burnout, offering directions for future research that address both dynamism and stability.

Meta-analytic results cumulated from 205 articles indicate that many of these variables hold significant consequences for work analysis data. Factors pertaining to descriptor choice, collection method, rating scale, and the purpose for conducting the work analysis each showed strong associations with work analysis data. The source of the work analysis information and organizational context in which it was conducted displayed fewer relationships. Findings can be used to inform choices work analysts make about methodology and postcollection evaluations of work analysis information.},

  abstract = {The problem of controlling a stochastic process with unknown parameters over an infinite horizon with discounting is considered. The possibility of sacrificing current period expected reward for information leading to possible increases in future reward is examined. Agents express beliefs about unknown parameters in terms of distributions. Under general conditions the sequence of beliefs converges to a limit distribution. The limit distribution may or may not be concentrated at the true parameter value. In some cases complete learning is optimal; in others the optimal strategy does not imply complete learning. The paper concludes with examination of some special cases including high and low discount rates, discrete parameter and action spaces (the n-armed bandit with correlated arms), and a class of examples in which incomplete learning is optimal.},

In Sample 2, time-lagged data from 100 full-time employees was collected in a constructive replication. Overall, findings suggested that the success of coping efforts as indicated by lower strains hinges on the combination of the severity of the stressor, perceived control over the stressor, and coping strategy used (problem-focused vs. emotion-focused coping). Results from the current study provide insights for why previous efforts to document the moderating effects of coping have been inconsistent, especially with regards to emotion-focused coping.},

We find that a higher relative price for fairness reduces its effect on the outcome of the transaction for women, but not for men. Our interpretation of this result is that men are more likely than women to make decisions on principle.},

  abstract = {Organizational scholars concur that supportive work relationships can attach employees to their workplace and improve the quality of organizational life, but they lack insights into how or why this occurs. Moreover, models of social support focus on what relationships provide without considering the fit between what people need and receive from their work relationships. Addressing these limitations, we developed and tested a theoretical model of relational attachment at work using a complementary fit perspective. After validating measures, we tested, extended, and replicated our model in three field studies. Results revealed that employees became more attached to their organization and experienced more beneficial outcomes when they had stronger psychological attachment to others at work. This relational attachment was not driven by general social support, but, rather, by "relational needs fit," which reflects employees' experience of having their needs met by their work relationships. However, receiving more personal support than what was wanted or needed intruded into employees' privacy boundaries and created a "too close for comfort" reaction whereby they pulled back from their work relationships. This "too much of a good thing" finding indicates that, while positive relationships at work are effective, social support should be tailored to individuals' needs.},

We provide a systematic review of the empirical studies on complementarities in leading journals in management, economics and related disciplines that considers the nature of the factors among which complementarities are found to exist, and the effects of complementarities in organizations. Our findings suggest that complementarities result from the skilful matching of heterogeneous resources which generate positive returns above and beyond the effect of each resource generated on its own. In contrast, the empirical evidence on complementarities between individual organizational and HR practices in firms provides mixed conclusions. We show that complementarities are likely to materialize in complex systems of multiple design elements. Therefore, future research should aim at uncovering complementary effects among multiple elements that capture organizational systems better than a few selected elements only do.},

  abstract = {Background: Defining what constitutes a resident care unit in nursing home research is both a conceptual and practical challenge. The aim of this paper is to provide evidence in support of a definition of care unit in nursing homes by demonstrating: (1) its feasibility for use in data collection, (2) the acceptability of aggregating individual responses to the unit level, and (3) the benefit of including unit level data in explanatory models.
Methods: An observational study design was used. Research (project) managers, healthcare aides, care managers, nursing home administrators and directors of care from thirty-six nursing homes in the Canadian prairie provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba provided data for the study. A definition of care unit was developed and applied in data collection and analyses. A debriefing session was held with research managers to investigate their experiences with using the care unit definition. In addition, survey responses from 1258 healthcare aides in 25 of the 36 nursing homes in the study, that had more than one care unit, were analyzed using a multi-level modeling approach. Trained field workers administered the Alberta Context Tool (ACT), a 58-item self-report survey reflecting 10 organizational context concepts, to healthcare aides using computer assisted personal interviews. To assess the appropriateness of obtaining unit level scores, we assessed aggregation statistics (ICC(1), ICC(2), h2, and ω2), and to assess the value of using the definition of unit in explanatory models, we performed multi-level modeling.
Results: In 10 of the 36 nursing homes, the care unit definition developed was used to align the survey data (for analytic purposes) to specific care units as designated by our definition, from that reported by the facility administrator. The aggregation statistics supported aggregating the healthcare aide responses on the ACT to the realigned unit level. Findings from the multi-level modeling further supported unit level aggregation. A significantly higher percentage of variance was explained in the ACT concepts at the unit level compared to the individual and/or nursing home levels.
Conclusions: The statistical results support the use of our definition of care unit in nursing home research in the Canadian prairie provinces. Beyond research convenience however, the results also support the resident unit as an important Clinical Microsystem to which future interventions designed to improve resident quality of care and staff (healthcare aide) worklife should be targeted.},

The difficulty in explaining this volatility has led economists to interpret it as exogenous, i.e., as the result of forces that lie outside the scope of the assumed economic relations. Consequently, it becomes hard or impossible to formulate short-run forecasts on asset prices or on values of macroeconomic variables. However, many random looking economic and financial series may, in fact, be subject to deterministic irregular behavior, which can be measured and modelled. We address the notion of endogenous volatility and exemplify the concept with a simple business-cycles model.},

  abstract = {The present work considers pricing and trade dynamics for stock commodity markets, which, unlike flow commodity markets have been little studied, if at all. Concepts and tools in economics are shaped to deal with flow markets, where commodities disappear in each period and then reemerge. This allows one to define unique demand and supply functions and their equilibria. A durable commodity, a stock, in contrast, remains on the market to the next period and may just change owner through exchange. This, however, changes demand and supply functions, and hence the equilibrium state to which a dynamic process may be heading. Dynamic processes are provided with memory of the actual exchange history. We also need to state how disequilibrium trade in stock markets takes place. This is another neglected issue, though a fact of reality. Using a case with only two traders of two stock commodities, and focusing pure trade, it is possible to specify the exact conditions for disequilibrium trade in each step of the dynamic process. In the end any of an infinity of equilibria can be reached, or trade can stick in some disequilibrium point while complex, even chaotic, price dynamics goes on.},

The rationale of this chapter is to verify to what extent the use of tools relying on chaos theory and complexity studies (in our case: multiscaling analysis) can be of any help to capture such anticipatory movements. To do this, we performed two separate tasks: we evaluated the Hurst exponent of the aforementioned indexes using a set of techniques, to give robustness to the results; we then moved to compute for each of them the Hölderian function values. The results suggested us the track along which developing a trading system based on the fractal characterization of the Eurostoxx 50 index whose performance will be provided and discussed as well.},

Results, however, remain confined to Kaldorian-type economies, namely to those economies which present a greater-than-unity marginal propensity to spend out of income. This paper contributes to the debate by showing that, in the case of a negative interest rate sensitivity of savings, stable endogenous cycles can actually emerge as equilibrium solutions of the model also in the case of non Kaldorian-type economies. To this end, we combine the instruments of the global analysis, specifically the homoclinic bifurcation Theorem of Kopell and Howard (1975), with numerical methods.},

Examples range from air traffic control systems, systems managing transactions on the stock exchange or environmental monitoring systems. The increasing complexity of such systems brings to the higher complexity of project management activities, which requires the review of commonly used methodologies to provide a better response to expectations of success for the planned projects. In this work we present a method for project monitoring and control based on the idea of a project view: given an analysis dimension such as time, cost and quality, each participant in the project has its own view on the project execution. The unavoidable differences between the views of various stakeholders have been formalized in the function gap that can be interpreted as an inverse measure of the degree of consonance between two participants with respect to the dimension of considered analysis. The method can leverage on the consonance seeking among stakeholders as a reduction factor of project risks.},

The formation of coalition may imply some theoretical difficulties, such as costs arising from forming a coalition or sharing information among agents. Coalition formation has the explicit purpose to represent the process of formation of coalitions of agents and hence modelling a number of relevant economic and social phenomena. Moreover, following this theoretical and applied literature on coalitions, the seminal chapter by Jackson and Wolinsky (1996) opened the way to a new stream of contributions using networks (graphs) to model the formation of links among individuals. In this chapter we will assume that only a subset S of the set of all possible coalitions in an economy is the set of admissible coalitions. We define the S -core concept, as in Hervès-Moreno. We will extend to a model with both uncertainty and asymmetric informations the results showed in Okuda and Shitovitz.},

  abstract = {In this chapter, we assume that corporate arrangement between owners, debt holders and managers builds modern firm. The governance of their interests and conflicts determines the crucial financial rules of the firm especially in the contemporary context of persistent financial crisis, accounting scandals, frauds and wasted earnings by the executive team. The lack of trust in their relationship with stockholders or bondholders pushes ownership to impose a strong discipline of payout mechanism extracting the free cash flows (FCF) from the manager hands. Accumulation of FCF and postponing payments should also imply a strong extra-dividend as a punishment to executives when they don’t respect the discipline of payout policy. To identify the dynamical outcome of such financial governance, we define a 3D system of differential equations modeling a firm under the best standard of management principles and rules but embedding a payout mechanism. The computations reveal that state variables of this firm follow a wide spectrum of dynamics amongst them singular strange attractors. The main results show that chaotic oscillation is an intrinsic and endogenous characteristic of the modern firm, not derived from (exogenous) market failure. Paradoxically, automated disciplining payout policy injects dynamical risks in a deterministic model of firm without any stochastic leverage.},

  abstract = {Voice is an important way that members contribute to effective team functioning. And yet, the existing literature provides divergent guidance as to how leaders can promote member voice in action teams—a dynamic team context where eliciting voice may be difficult, due to different task demands encountered in the preparation and action phases of task performance, among members who may have little history of working together. Drawing on the employee voice and team leadership literatures, we focus on three leader behaviors—directing, coaching, and supporting—and employ a functional leadership perspective to assess whether certain leader behaviors enhance voice in one phase of the performance episode versus the other. We also assess whether these leadership-voice relationships are further contingent on team members’ prior familiarity with one another. Observation and survey data from 105 surgical team episodes revealed that leader directing promoted voice in both the preparation and action phases. Coaching also facilitated voice in both phases, especially in the action phase for more familiar teams. Surprisingly, supporting did not enhance voice in either phase, and in fact exhibited negative effects on voice in the preparation phase of more familiar teams. Theoretical and practical implications around how leaders can elicit voice in action teams are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)},

  abstract = {Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) can be regarded as a static or dynamic classification problem, which makes SER an excellent test bed for investigating and comparing various deep learning architectures. We describe a frame-based formulation to SER that relies on minimal speech processing and end-to-end deep learning to model intra-utterance dynamics. We use the proposed SER system to empirically explore feed-forward and recurrent neural network architectures and their variants. Experiments conducted illuminate the advantages and limitations of these architectures in paralinguistic speech recognition and emotion recognition in particular. As a result of our exploration, we report state-of-the-art results on the IEMOCAP database for speaker-independent SER and present quantitative and qualitative assessments of the models’ performances.},

  abstract = {In this work we develop and apply a class of hierarchical directed graphical models on the task of recognizing affective categories from prosody in both acted and natural speech. A strength of this new approach is the integration and summarization of information using both local (e.g., syllable level) and global prosodic phenomena (e.g., utterance level). In this framework speech is structurally modeled as a dynamically evolving hierarchical model in which levels of the hierarchy are determined by prosodic constituency and contain parameters that evolve according to dynamical systems. The acoustic parameters have been chosen to reflect four main components of speech thought to reflect paralinguistic and affect-specific information: intonation, loudness, rhythm and voice quality. The work is first evaluated on a database of acted emotions and compared to human perceptual recognition of five affective categories where it achieves rates within nearly 10\% of human recognition accuracy despite only focusing on prosody. The model is then evaluated on two different corpora of fully spontaneous, affectively-colored, naturally occurring speech between people: Call Home English and BT Call Center. Here the ground truth labels are obtained from examining the agreement of 29 human coders labeling arousal and valence. The best discrimination performance on the natural spontaneous speech, using only the prosody features, obtains a 70\% detection rate with 30\% false alarms when detecting high arousal negative valence speech in call centers.},

  abstract = {I applied a dynamic motivation theory to predict the hazard rate h( t) of absence taking. h( t) is the instantaneous rate of going from work attendance to work absence in a unit of time, given that the individual has been in attendance until time t. Intuitively, h( t) estimates the strength of unfulfilled nonwork motives. The present article introduced a more appropriate statistical model for attendance analysis, the Cox proportional hazard rate model, estimated using partial likelihood. Absence records for one year for 465 underground coal miners, generating 7,064 attendance spells, were used. Hypotheses about the impact of prior and subsequent absence spells on h( t) were formulated. h( t) was affected by the type of prior and subsequent absence, although some predictions were not supported. A Monte Carlo study of the model and the random occurrence of involuntary absence helped explain the unexpected estimates of h( t) of absence taking. The problems of unobserved heterogeneity and nonindependence of spells were addressed using both modeling and bootstrapping-type procedures. Theoretical and managerial implications of the results are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

After the move, experienced aspects of the new location such as role ambiguity, degree of advancement, and community and job satisfaction were the strongest predictors of overall post-move attitude and adjustment difficulty. In many cases, pre-move expectations about attributes of the new location were not related to affect or adjustment after the move, suggesting that pre-move expectations may have been inaccurate. Implications for theory, research, and organizational practice are discussed.},

The aim of this study was to find predictors for leaving nursing care with special reference to physical working conditions and musculoskeletal problems.
Methods: This study is based on longitudinal data from a survey of nursing personnel who were employed at various county hospitals in Sweden from 1992–95. A self administrated follow up questionnaire was used to identify their present position in the labour market. The response rate was 73\% (n = 1095).
Results: The results showed that nursing personnel reporting musculoskeletal problems of the neck/ shoulder or knees and those who had limited use of transfer devices were more likely to leave nursing care.
Conclusions: The study highlights the importance of taking musculoskeletal problems and use of transfer devices into consideration in order to retain nursing personnel.},

  abstract = {The associations between industry revenue growth, individual work role characteristics, and job satisfaction were examined in this cross-level mediation analysis. Work roles were expected to be more autonomous, involve greater skill variety, and offer more opportunities for growth and development for workers in growing industries than for workers in declining industries. Supervisor support was also hypothesized to be stronger for workers in high-growth industries. Results from a nationally representative (U.S.) sample of service industry workers, using multilevel modeling, supported these propositions and suggest that job enrichment mediates relations between industry growth and job satisfaction. Associations between industry growth and autonomy were also stronger among workers in occupations that are less normatively autonomous, suggesting that industry growth fosters a weakening, and industry decline a strengthening, of traditional differences in autonomy across work roles. These results contribute to a multilevel perspective on organizational environments, individual work roles, and worker attitudes and well-being.

Drawing on several meta-analytic studies and recent empirical work, we first synthesize what is now reliably known with respect to the generalization and retention of learned knowledge and skills to work contexts. The second part of our review focuses on what is unknown—the significant gaps in our knowledge where we believe new directions in our research strategies are warranted. We offer three prescriptions: (a) going one step beyond most existing studies to offer greater precision in our specification and measurement of variables and interventions, (b) connecting the dots by focusing on transfer criteria and transfer trajectories, and (c) shifting the operative paradigm of research to examine contemporary learning from a problem-centered perspective. There is ample opportunity to increase the yield on enormous organizational investments in training if transfer scholars and practitioners are fully informed of what is known and prepared to systematically confront the unknown in new and innovative ways.},

Attempts to operationalize the concept of "organizational climate" in studies of organizational behavior provide a number of methods for assessing environmental variation, and yield data relevant to hypotheses regarding the interaction of persons and environments. Methods for observing climate variation include field studies, assessments of participant's perceptions, observations of objective indices, and experimental control of organizational variables. Conditions may affect behavior by determining stimuli, by restraining freedom of response, and by rewarding and punishing behavior. Illustrative of the organizational properties meriting further study are size, structure, systems complexity, leadership pattern, and goal directions. Selected bibliography of 104 titles indicates how studies of organizations make possible the variation of both person and climate variables. (3-p. ref.)

  abstract = {Background: Job strain (i.e., high job demands combined with low job control) is a frequently used indicator of harmful work stress, but studies have often used partial versions of the complete multi-item job demands and control scales. Understanding whether the different instruments assess the same underlying concepts has crucial implications for the interpretation of findings across studies, harmonisation of multi-cohort data for pooled analyses, and design of future studies. As part of the ‘IPD-Work’ (Individual-participant-data meta-analysis in working populations) consortium, we compared different versions of the demands and control scales available in 17 European cohort studies.
Methods: Six of the 17 studies had information on the complete scales and 11 on partial scales. Here, we analyse individual level data from 70 751 participants of the studies which had complete scales (5 demand items, 6 job control items).
Results: We found high Pearson correlation coefficients between complete scales of job demands and control relative to scales with at least three items (r {$>$} 0.90) and for partial scales with two items only (r = 0.76-0.88). In comparison with scores from the complete scales, the agreement between job strain definitions was very good when only one item was missing in either the demands or the control scale (kappa {$>$} 0.80); good for job strain assessed with three demand items and all six control items (kappa {$>$} 0.68) and moderate to good when items were missing from both scales (kappa = 0.54-0.76). The sensitivity was {$>$} 0.80 when only one item was missing from either scale, decreasing when several items were missing in one or both job strain subscales.
Conclusions: Partial job demand and job control scales with at least half of the items of the complete scales, and job strain indices based on one complete and one partial scale, seemed to assess the same underlying concepts as the complete survey instruments.},

Using a Web-based daily survey of stressor events, perceived strain, mood, and job satisfaction completed by 14 university workers, 1,060 occasions of data were collected. Transfer function analysis, a multivariate version of time series analysis, was used to examine the data for relationships among the measured variables after factoring out the contaminating influences of serial dependency. Results revealed a contrast effect in which a stressful event associated positively with higher strain on the same day and associated negatively with strain on the following day. Perceived strain increased over the course of a semester for a majority of participants, suggesting that effects of stress build over time. Finally, the data were consistent with the notion that job satisfaction id a distal outcome that is mediated by perceived strain. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

  abstract = {Low levels of employee trust in top leaders pose challenges to organizations with respect to retention, performance, and profits. This research examines how trust in top leaders can be fostered through the relationships individuals have with their direct leaders. We propose a trickle-up model whereby trust in direct leaders exerts an upward influence on trust in top leaders. Drawing on the group value model, we predict that direct leaders’ procedural justice serves as the key mechanism in facilitating the trickle-up process. Further, this process should be particularly strong for employees high on vertical collectivism, and the trickled-up trust in top leaders should exert a stronger impact on employees’ overall performance in the organization than trust in direct leaders. Multiphase and multisource data from 336 individuals support these hypotheses. The findings advance our understanding of trust and leadership by highlighting that trust in leaders at different levels does not form independently and that trust in leaders trickles up across hierarchical levels.

  abstract = {Code-based metrics such as coupling and cohesion are used to measure a system’s structural complexity. But dealing with large systems—those consisting of several millions of lines— at the code level faces many problems. An alternative approach is to concentrate on the system’s building blocks such as programs or modules as the unit of examination. We present an approach that uses information in a release history of a system to uncover logical dependencies and change patterns among modules. We have developed the approach by working with 20 releases of a large Telecommunications Switching System. We use release information such as version numbers of programs, modules, and subsystems together with change reports to discover common change behavior (i.e. change patterns) of modules. Our approach identifies logical coupling among modules in such a way that potential structural shortcomings can be identified and further examined, pointing to restructuring or reengineering opportunities.},

However, it is less well appreciated that local competition favours selection for spite, the relatively neglected ugly sister of altruism. Here, we use extensions of social evolution theory that were formulated to deal with the consequences for altruism of competition between social partners, to illustrate several points on the evolution of spite. Specifically, we show that: (i) the conditions for the evolution of spite are less restrictive than previously assumed; (ii) previous models which have demonstrated selection for spite often implicitly assumed local competition; (iii) the scale of competition must be allowed for when distinguishing different forms of spite (Hamiltonian vs. Wilsonian); (iv) local competition can enhance the spread of spiteful greenbeards; and (v) the theory makes testable predictions for how the extent of spite should vary dependent upon population structure and average relatedness.},

A pilot study has been performed in order to investigate the relationship between diversity perceptions and organizational performance perceptions by making use of the diversity typology set out by Harrison and Klein (2007) based on variety, separation, and disparity. However, this pilot study has several limitations and more advanced research needs to be conducted in order to show how diversity types can have different effects. The data were gathered by means of a questionnaire filled out by managers from various Dutch organizations (N ϭ 291). The pilot study showed that employee diversity can have different effects in an organization depending on how this diversity is considered; for example, employee diversity considered as levels of status may have a negative effect, while employee diversity considered as different levels of expertise can have a positive effect. The way diversity is perceived by managers in an organizational setting can have important relations with how organizational performance is perceived by those managers. The paper implies to show that employee diversity can have a variety of effects in the workplace depending on how employee diversity is considered. This knowledge may help to increase positive effects of diversity in the workplace when managers need to deal with diversity and improve organizational outcomes.},

These predictions are generated and maintained as people update their beliefs more readily when receiving information that calls for adjustment in an optimistic direction relative to information that calls for adjustment in a pessimistic direction. Thus far this update bias has been shown when people make estimations regarding the self. Here, we examine whether asymmetric belief updating also exists when making estimations regarding population base rates. We reveal that while participants update beliefs regarding risk in the population in an asymmetric manner, such valence-dependent updating of base rates can be accounted for by priors. In contrast, we show that optimistic updating regarding the self is a robust phenomenon, which holds even under different empirical definitions of desirable information.},

After correcting for confounds we identify in the experiments of Shah et al., an optimistic update bias for positive life events is revealed. Contrary to claims made by Shah et al., we observe that participants update their beliefs in a more Bayesian manner after receiving good news than bad. Finally, we show that the parameters Shah et al. pre-selected for simulations are at odds with participants’ data, making these simulations irrelevant to the question asked.

  abstract = {This article analyzes how the equilibrium concept is used in four organization theories: the theories of Fayol, Mintzberg, Morgan, and Volberda. Equilibrium can be defined as balance, fit or requisite variety. Equilibrium is related to observables dependent on the definition of organization as work organization, formal organization or artifact organization. The discussed theories can be mapped on a state space model in a way that clarifies the equilibrium concept. The equilibrium concept in organization theory in general can be formalized mathematically using concepts from systems theory. The equilibrium condition can be formulated in terms of a difference function that has to be zero at equilibrium. A central idea is the necessity to maintain equilibrium by actions. This is done by means of a circular causal mechanism that reinforces equilibrium once it has been established as long as the organization conforms to the Law of Requisite Variety. The difference function on which the condition of organizational equilibrium is based takes different forms for each of the four organization theories studied. The establishment of these difference functions enables a comparison with the types of fit described by Venkatraman. It turns out that all types of fit described by Venkatraman are gamma-space based. The analysis of the four theories leads to five equilibrium types, of which two (the Gestalt type and the Matching type) have been described by Venkatraman. Three types of equilibrium that were found have not been covered by Venkatraman: Fayol’s balance / mu-space type, Volberda’s gamma-space/ variety type and Morgan’s mu-space / variety type.},

Participants were given explicit feedback about their completion time and accuracy each day after task completion. We applied a multivariate vector auto-regressive model of order 1 to the daily mean reaction time (RT) and daily accuracy scores together, within each age group. We expected that participants adjusted their SAT if the two cross-regressive parameters from RT (or accuracy) on day t-1 of accuracy (or RT) on day t were sizable and negative. We found that: (a) the temporal dependencies of both accuracy and RT were quite strong in both age groups; (b) younger adults showed an effect of their accuracy on day t-1 on their RT on day t, a pattern that was in accordance with adjustments of their SAT; (c) older adults did not appear to adjust their SAT; (d) these effects were partly associated with reliable individual differences within each age group. We discuss possible explanations for older adults’ reluctance to recalibrate speed and accuracy on a day-to-day basis.},

  abstract = {Approaches to performance beliefs were compared in terms of differentiating between groups and predicting performance. Based on this review, the construct of group-efficacy, defined as a group's estimate regarding their ability to perform, was developed. Hypotheses regarding correlates of group-efficacy, moderators of the relationship between group-efficacy and performance, and moderators of the relationship between self-and group-efficacy were proposed. Two studies with distinct methods were conducted across three cultures. Study \#1 utilized a complex business simulation in the U.S. and Hong Kong. Participants were randomly assigned to play roles in a simulated organization. Surveys measured efficacy beliefs. Videotaped group performance was rated by trained observers. Study \#2 investigated nursing teams representing matched hospitals in the U.S. and Indonesia. Potential efficacy correlates, efficacy beliefs, and quality of care were monitored for 8 weeks. Four variables were related to the level of group-efficacy (status, affect, collectivism, and differentiation). Group-efficacy was positively correlated with status differential and positive affect in the simulation. Group-efficacy and collectivism were positively correlated for nurses, but this effect was non-significant in the simulation. Group-efficacy and differentiation were negatively correlated in the simulation, but positively correlated for nurses. Three variables moderated the relationship between group-efficacy and performance: task interdependence, individualism-collectivism, and differentiation. Nursing teams high in interdependence performed better under conditions of high group-efficacy than under low group-efficacy; teams low in interdependence performed equally well under both conditions. Simulation teams low in differentiation performed better under conditions of high group-efficacy than under low group-efficacy, teams high in differentiation performed equally well under both conditions. Results regarding individualism-collectivism were mixed. Collectivistic nursing teams performed better under conditions of high group-efficacy, while individualists performed worse under such conditions. Collectivistic simulation teams performed equally well under both conditions. No support was obtained for moderators of the relationship between self-and group-efficacy. Results provide evidence that certain variables are associated with the level of group-efficacy, while others moderate the relationship between group-efficacy and performance. Perhaps the most intriguing finding was that the relationship between group-efficacy and performance was negative under certain conditions. Implications of these findings for research and practice are discussed.},

Further, we expect that older people have greater prior entrepreneurial experience than younger people, which makes it more likely for older (vs. younger) people to transition from forming entrepreneurial intentions to engaging in entrepreneurial activity. We tested our hypotheses using longitudinal data from 343 working adults from Australia across 12 months with three measurement waves. Results supported our hypotheses.

Depressed participants were followed over the course of treatment and video recorded during a series of clinical interviews. Facial expressions were analyzed from the video using both manual and automatic systems. Automatic and manual coding were highly consistent for FACS action units, and showed similar effects for change over time in depression severity. For both systems, when symptom severity was high, participants made more facial expressions associated with contempt, smiled less, and those smiles that occurred were more likely to be accompanied by facial actions associated with contempt. These results are consistent with the “social risk hypothesis” of depression. According to this hypothesis, when symptoms are severe, depressed participants withdraw from other people in order to protect themselves from anticipated rejection, scorn, and social exclusion. As their symptoms fade, participants send more signals indicating a willingness to affiliate. The finding that automatic facial expression analysis was both consistent with manual coding and produced the same pattern of depression effects suggests that automatic facial expression analysis may be ready for use in behavioral and clinical science.},

  abstract = {In this case study, I examine the approaches to education used in various organizational contexts by lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) activists seeking domestic partner benefits within a major state university system throughout a nearly 20-year effort. Diversity education by activists occurred through self-censoring behaviors, varying degrees of coalition building, and the regular use of testimonials. I consider these efforts through the lens of five approaches to diversity, which illuminate the complex, multifaceted tactics utilized in various phases and contexts of the 20-year effort. Activists primarily used identity-aware approaches and harmonious diversity approaches. The article provides insight into the influence of identity, ressentiment, and intergroup coalitions in seeking these policy changes. In particular, the study provides researchers, activists, and other practitioners with evidence demonstrating the successful use of different approaches to diversity. These flexible approaches were used in response to varying organizational contexts throughout this long-term organization change effort. Despite the tension that arose among activists in determining which approach to use, the deliberative and flexible use of these approaches resulted in a well-respected and generally successful effort.},

  abstract = {When collecting migrants’ life stories, researchers often report on the role of chance encounters in influencing the way migration trajectories have taken shape or how migrants have managed their lives in a new country. Aside from reporting on such encounters, however, there have been no explicit efforts to theorise chance or to make it central to in-depth analysis in migration studies. This paper aims to theorise the role of chance encounters in migrants’ trajectories by drawing on insights from the psychology literature of chance encounters and life paths. Our analysis of the role of chance encounters, structured by the interplay between environmental and personal factors, suggests that how people deal with chance is an influential factor in the ways people migrate from the Global South to the Global North and manage their lives in transit. The paper makes use of evidence collected among 46 African migrants in Ukraine during 7 months of field research in 2011–2012 and reflects on the methodological implications in studying chance.

  abstract = {This study investigates whether the altruism and courtesy dimensions of organizational citizenship behaviors (OCB) regulate mood at work. Social psychological theories of mood regulation suggest helping behaviors can improve individuals’ moods because helping others provides gratification and directs attention away from one's negative mood. We capture mood states prior to and following the enactment of OCBs using experience sampling methodology in a sample of managerial and professional employees over a 3-week period. Results suggest altruism shows a pattern consistent with mood regulation; negative moods during the prior time period are associated with altruism and positive moods in the subsequent time period. The pattern of results for courtesy behaviors is only partially consistent with a mood regulation explanation. Consistent with theories of behavioral concordance, interaction results suggest individuals higher on Extroversion have more intense positive mood reactions after engaging in altruistic behaviors. Interactions with courtesy were not significant.},

  abstract = {Public goods games played by a group of individuals collectively performing actions towards a common interest characterize social dilemmas where both competition and cooperation are present. By using agent-based simulation, this paper investigates how collective action in the form of repeated n-person linear public goods games is affected when the interaction of individuals is driven by the underlying hierarchical structure of an organization. The proposed agent-based simulation model is based on generally known empirical findings about public goods games and takes into account that individuals may change their profiles from conditional cooperators to rational egoists or vice versa. To do so, a fuzzy logic system was designed to allow the cumulative modification of agents’ profiles in the presence of vague variables such as individuals’ attitude towards group pressure and/or their perception about the cooperation of others. From the simulation results, it can be concluded that collective action is affected by the structural characteristics of hierarchical organizations. The major findings are as follows: 1) Cooperation in organizational structures is fostered when there is a collegial model defining the structure of the punishment mechanisms employed by organizations. 2) Having multiple, and small organizational units fosters group pressure and highlights the positive perception about the cooperation of others, resulting in organizations achieving relatively high aggregate contribution levels. 3) The greater the number of levels, the higher the aggregate contribution level of an organization when effective sanctioning systems are introduced.},

Thus, the purpose of this study is to investigate the interactive relationship between job demands, control, and death. Drawing from the job design, stress, and epidemiology literatures, we argue that job demands will be positively related to mortality under conditions of low control, and negatively related to mortality under conditions of high control. We tested our hypothesis using a 7-year time-lagged design in a sample of 2,363 individuals from the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study. Our results supported our hypothesis, with results showing that for individuals in low control jobs, high job demands are associated with a 15.4\% increase in the odds of death compared to low job demands. For those in high control jobs, high job demands are associated with a 34\% decrease in the odds of death compared to low job demands. Supplementary analyses revealed a similar pattern predicting body mass index in the group of surviving individuals. We discuss the implications of these findings for theory and practice, while proposing several avenues for future research.},

  abstract = {Integrating the costs and benefits of collective behaviors is a fundamental challenge to understanding the evolution of group living. These costs and benefits can rarely be quantified simultaneously due to the complexity of the interactions within the group, or even compared to each other because of the absence of common metrics between them. The construction of ‘living bridges’ by New World army ants - which they use to shorten their foraging trails - is a unique example of a collective behavior where costs and benefits have been experimentally measured and related to each other. As a result, it is possible to make quantitative predictions about when and how the behavior will be observed. In this paper, we extend a previous mathematical model of these costs and benefits into a general framework for analyzing the optimal formation, and final configuration, of army ant living bridges. We provide experimentally testable predictions of the final bridge position, as well as the optimal formation process for certain cases, for a wide range of scenarios, which more closely resemble common terrain obstacles that ants encounter in nature. As such, our framework offers a rare benchmark for determining the evolutionary pressures governing the evolution of a naturally occurring collective animal behavior.},

  abstract = {The two prize winners in Economics this year would describe themselves as “Econometricians, ” so I thought that I should start by explaining that term. One can begin with the ancient subject of Mathematics which is largely concerned with the discovery of relationships between deterministic variables using a rigorous argument. (A deterministic variable is one whose value is known with certainty.) However, by the middle of the last millennium it became clear that some objects were not deterministic, they had to be described with the use of probabilities, so that Mathematics grew a substantial sub-field known as “Statistics. ” This later became involved with the analysis of data and a number of methods have been developed for data having what may be called “standard properties.” However, in some areas of application, the data that they generated were found to be not standard, and so special sub-sub-fields needed to be developed. For example, Biology produced Biometrics, Psychology gave us Psychometrics, and Economics produced Econometrics.},

  abstract = {Although helping behaviors can increase the effectiveness of work units, when task interdependence is low, units often develop norms of self-interest that inhibit helping. Little research has explained how these norms can be changed by a work unit member. We present a minority influence framework that specifies how norms can shift in response to a challenger’s consistent modeling, advocating, or inquiring about helping behavior, contingent on prosocial impact, status, similarity, work unit agree-ableness and openness, and timing. We also examine how normative conflict moti-vates efforts to initiate and sustain challenges, depending on identification, status, and small wins. Our model provides a novel theoretical account of how helping norms emerge in work units to support caring and compassion. The success of work units often depends on helping behaviors from employees (Katz \& Kahn, 1966; Organ, 1988). Helping involves prosocial, promotive, and cooperative behaviors intended to benefit others—actions that foster interper-sonal harmony, facilitate task completion, and build and maintain relationships (Brief \& Moto-},

We draw on impression management theory to propose that impression management motives strengthen the association between prosocial motives and affiliative citizenship by encouraging employees to express citizenship in ways that both “do good” and “look good.” We report 2 studies that examine the interactions of prosocial and impression management motives as predictors of affiliative citizenship using multisource data from 2 different field samples. Across the 2 studies, we find positive interactions between prosocial and impression management motives as predictors of affiliative citizenship behaviors directed toward other people (helping and courtesy) and the organization (initiative). Study 2 also shows that only prosocial motives predict voice—a challenging citizenship behavior. Our results suggest that employees who are both good soldiers and good actors are most likely to emerge as good citizens in promoting the status quo.},

The results indicate that cohesion had a negligible impact on team performance. A stronger effect was found for the impact of performance on cohesion with winning teams having higher levels of cohesion than losing teams. These findings are consistent with previous literature and lend experimental support to the conclusion that performance has more impact on cohesion than cohesion has on performance.},

For the experimental group of 526 bank tellers, the attitudinal variables initially improved but then declined to previous levels. Performance showed no change after 6 months, but significant improvements were observed after 24 and 48 months. The results suggested the critical importance of looking at patterns of change over extended periods of time and of obtaining multiple measures of key variables.},

Latent growth methods have been applied in many domains to examine average and differential responses to interventions and treatments. In this review, we introduce the growth modeling approach to studying change by presenting different models of change and interpretations of their model parameters. We then apply these methods to examining sex differences in the development of binge drinking behavior through adolescence and into adulthood. Advances in growth modeling methods are then discussed and include inherently nonlinear growth models, derivative specification of growth models, and latent change score models to study stochastic change processes. We conclude with relevant design issues of longitudinal studies and considerations for the analysis of longitudinal data.},

  abstract = {The quality of working life became an important topic in the 1960s and 1970s, helping to stimulate an early approach to evidence-based policy advocacy drawing on interdisciplinary research by social scientists. Over the years it fell out of the limelight but much relevant, albeit fragmented, research has continued. We present a case for rekindling an integrated and normative approach to quality of working life research as one means of promoting workers’ well-being and emancipation. We outline an updated classification of the characteristics of quality of working life and a related analytic framework. We illustrate how research and practice will benefit from following this renewed quality of working life framework, using work design as an example. Concluding, we aim to stimulate debate on the necessity and benefits of rebuilding a quality of working life agenda for marrying academic rigour and practical relevance in order to support interventions aimed at fostering worker emancipation and well-being.},

We use fundamentals of research on creativity and innovation as a lens through which we can view problems and possible solutions to these problems. In particular, we stress that innovation entails not only new, but also useful insights, that innovation requires “rewarding failure”, and that innovation feeds off of team diversity. We provide suggestions for how the definition of theoretical and empirical contributions of research, reward systems, and collaboration practices could be changed to foster innovative research that helps people thrive at work.},

  abstract = {Mediation is a causal process that evolves over time. Thus, a study of mediation requires data collected throughout the process. However, most applications of mediation analysis use cross-sectional rather than longitudinal data. Another implicit assumption commonly made in longitudinal designs for mediation analysis is that the same mediation process universally applies to all members of the population under investigation. This assumption ignores the important issue of ergodicity before aggregating the data across subjects. We first argue that there exists a discrepancy between the concept of mediation and the research designs that are typically used to investigate it. Second, based on the concept of ergodicity, we argue that a given mediation process probably is not equally valid for all individuals in a population. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to propose a two-faceted solution. The first facet of the solution is that we advocate a single-subject time-series design that aligns data collection with researchers' conceptual understanding of mediation. The second facet is to introduce a flexible statistical method—the state space model—as an ideal technique to analyze single-subject time series data in mediation studies. We provide an overview of the state space method and illustrative applications using both simulated and real time series data. Finally, we discuss additional issues related to research design and modeling.},

Study 1a was a longitudinal field experiment at a US insurance company. Compared to workers under waitlist control, employees who were assigned to a daily mindfulness training reported more helping behaviors over a five day period both in quantitative surveys and qualitative daily diaries. Study 1b, conducted in a large consulting company in India, extends these findings with a field experiment in which co-workers rated the prosocial behavior of teammates in a round robin design. Moving from devoting time to devoting money, in Studies 2a and 2b we find that individuals randomly assigned to engage in a focused breathing meditation were more financially generous. To understand the mechanisms of mindfulness’ effects on prosocial behavior, Study 3 found support for empathy and moderate support for perspective taking as mediators. This study also examined the effects of induced state mindfulness via two different mindfulness inductions, focused breathing and loving kindness meditation. Our results indicate that secular state mindfulness can make people more other-oriented and helpful. This benefit holds even in the workplace, where being helpful toward others might face constraints but is nevertheless of great importance.},

In 2 time-lagged samples, the authors found that motivation mediates the emotional exhaustion-job performance relationship. Moreover, the authors found that participants appear to target their investment of resources in response to emotional exhaustion to develop social support through social exchange; specifically, emotional exhaustion was associated with communion striving resources that were manifest in the form of organizational citizenship behaviors targeted at individuals. Implications of this relationship for theories of burnout and for management practice are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)},

In two studies including a total of 354 employees from a variety of industries over five time periods over the duration of a week, we found support for the positive relationship between exhaustion and OCB-I, the negative relationships between of exhaustion and in-role performance and OCBO, as well as the moderation effect of reciprocity.

  abstract = {This article provides an integrative review of the literature on judgment-based predictions of performance time, often described as task duration predictions in psychology and as expert-based effort estimation in engineering and management science. We summarize results on the characteristics of performance time predictions, processes and strategies, the influence of task characteristics and contextual factors, and the relations between estimates and characteristics of the estimator. Although dependent on the type of study and the level of analysis, underestimation was more frequently reported than overestimation in studies from the engineering and management literature. However, this was not the case in studies from the psychology literature. Our summaries challenge earlier results regarding the effects of factors such as complexity/difficulty and experience. We also question the recurrent finding that small tasks are overestimated and large tasks are underestimated, as this to some extent can be a statistical artifact caused by random error. Several other influences on predictions are identified and discussed. These include various types of anchoring effects, performance and accuracy incentives, task decomposition, request formats, group estimation, revisions of initial ideal or incomplete estimates, level of abstraction, and superficial cues. We summarize similarities and differences between performance time predictions (e.g., number of work hours) and completion time predictions (e.g., delivery dates) because many studies fail to distinguish between these 2 types of predictions. Finally, we discuss methodological issues in time prediction research and implications for research and application.},

  abstract = {With the growing popularity of intensive longitudinal research, the modeling techniques and software options for such data are also expanding rapidly. Here we use dynamic multilevel modeling, as it is incorporated in the new dynamic structural equation modeling (DSEM) toolbox in Mplus, to analyze the affective data from the COGITO study. These data consist of two samples of over 100 individuals each who were measured for about 100 days. We use composite scores of positive and negative affect and apply a multilevel vector autoregressive model to allow for individual differences in means, autoregressions, and cross-lagged effects. Then we extend the model to include random residual variances and covariance, and finally we investigate whether prior depression affects later depression scores through the random effects of the daily diary measures. We end with discussing several urgent—but mostly unresolved—issues in the area of dynamic multilevel modeling.},

  abstract = {In many disciplines researchers use longitudinal panel data to investigate the potentially causal relationship between two variables. However, the conventions and concerns vary widely across disciplines. Here we focus on two concerns, that is: a) the concern about random effects versus fixed effects, which is central in the (micro-)econometrics/sociology literature; and b) the concern about grand mean versus group (or person) mean centering, which is central in the multilevel literature associated with disciplines like psychology and educational sciences. We show that these two concerns are actually addressing the same underlying issue. We discuss diverse modeling methods based on either multilevel regression modeling with the data in long format, or structural equation modeling with the data in wide format, and compare these approaches with simulated data. We extend the multilevel model with random slopes and discuss the consequences of this. Subsequently, we provide guidelines on how to choose between the diverse modeling options. We illustrate the use of these guidelines with an empirical example based on intensive longitudinal data, in which we consider both a time-varying and a time-invariant covariate.},

Based on Conservation of Resources theory and the Work-Home Resources Model, we hypothesized that implementing a work-family intervention aimed at increasing contextual resources via supervisor support for work and family and employee control over work time would lead to improved personal resources and increased employee performance on the job in the form of self-reported safety compliance and organizational citizenship behaviors. Multilevel analyses used survey data from 1,524 employees at baseline, 6-month and 12-month post-intervention follow-ups. Significant intervention effects were observed for safety compliance at the 6-month and organizational citizenship behaviors at the 12-month follow-ups. More specifically, results demonstrate that the intervention protected against declines in employee self-reported safety compliance and organizational citizenship behaviors, compared to employees in the control facilities. The hypothesized mediators of perceptions of family supportive supervisor behaviors, control over work time, and work-family conflict (work-to-family conflict, family-to-work conflict) were not significantly improved by the intervention. However, baseline perceptions of family supportive supervisor behaviors, control over work time, and work-family climate were significant moderators of the intervention effect on the self-reported safety compliance and organizational citizenship behavior outcomes.},

  abstract = {Self-regulation and learning are fundamentally dynamic phenomena that occur at the within-person level and unfold over time. However, the majority of the extant empirical research on self-regulated learning has been conducted at the between-person level, which can obscure the true nature of interrelationships among self-regulatory mechanisms. In the present study, we seek to advance a more nuanced view of the role of self-regulation in modern training and development by presenting a novel theoretical perspective that integrates cognitive, motivational, and behavioral mechanisms central to the literature on active learning with the more dynamic theoretical principles and mechanisms underlying stage-based cognitive models of skill acquisition. Hypotheses derived from this model were tested in a laboratory study with 305 participants who practiced a dynamic computer game involving strong cognitive and perceptual-motor demands. Bivariate cross-lagged latent growth models generally supported the proposed model, revealing systematic trends over the course of practice consistent with a series of iterative, bidirectional, and self-correcting reciprocal interrelationships among self-efficacy, metacognition, exploratory behavior, and practice performance. Collectively, these findings suggest that strong positive interrelationships among self-regulated learning variables at the between-person level may, in some cases, actually belie the true nature of their functional effects. Implications for theory and practice are discussed.},

  abstract = {Inferring species interactions from co-occurrence data is one of the most controversial tasks in community ecology. One difficulty is that a single pairwise interaction can ripple through an ecological network and produce surprising indirect consequences. For example, the negative correlation between two competing species can be reversed in the presence of a third species that outcompetes both of them. Here, I apply models from statistical physics, called Markov networks or Markov random fields, that can predict the direct and indirect consequences of any possible species interaction matrix. Interactions in these models can be estimated from observed co-occurrence rates via maximum likelihood, controlling for indirect effects. Using simulated landscapes with known interactions, I evaluated Markov networks and six existing approaches. Markov networks consistently outperformed the other methods, correctly isolating direct interactions between species pairs even when indirect interactions or abiotic factors largely overpowered them. Two computationally efficient approximations, which controlled for indirect effects with partial correlations or generalized linear models, also performed well. Null models showed no evidence of being able to control for indirect effects, and reliably yielded incorrect inferences when such effects were present.},

Drawing from Gestalt characteristics theory (Ariely \& Carmon, 2000, 2003), we examine the concept of justice trajectories (i.e., levels and trends of individual fairness perceptions over time) and offer empirical evidence to highlight the value of considering fairness within a dynamic context. Participants included 523 working adults who completed surveys about their work experiences on 4 occasions over the course of 1 year. Results indicate that justice trends explained additional variance in distal work outcomes (job satisfaction, organizational commitment, and turnover intentions) after controlling for end-state levels of justice, demonstrating the cumulative effects of justice over time. Findings also reveal that change in procedural justice perceptions affected distal work outcomes more strongly than any other justice dimension. Implications for theory and future investigations of justice as a dynamic construct are discussed.},

The first study investigated responses from employees in three separate plants who completed a facet measure, a single-item global measure, along with items and facets chosen by an employee committee. Results indicated that the employee-chosen facets accounted for some incremental variance in the prediction of the single-item measure. A second study investigated the relationship between a single-item and a facet measure of benefit package satisfaction when the entire benefit package domain was included in the facet measure. The magnitude of the relationship suggested that the single-item measure of global benefit package satisfaction involved consideration of more than merely satisfaction with each element in the package. Limitations and alternative explanations for the findings are discussed.},

Across three studies with varying measures, we found that task i-deals, independently and jointly with financial i-deals, conveyed a positive message regarding competence in that they were positively related to recipients’ competence need satisfaction. In turn, competence need satisfaction positively related to organizational citizenship behaviors. The competence-signaling function of task i-deals and task-financial i-deals interaction remained significant even after accounting for leader–member exchange, organization-based self-esteem, and perceived organizational support. Financial i-deals, however, did not exhibit a competence-signaling function. The current research sheds light on the signaling function of i-deals and their interaction, and provides guidance on the practice of granting one or multiple types of i-deals. Ó 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Even though diversity, especially diversity of perspectives and knowledge, is frequently argued to stimulate higher creativity in teams, empirical findings on this relationship remain inconsistent. We have developed a theoretical model in which the effect of a team’s diversity on its creativity is moderated by the degree to which team members engage in perspective taking. We propose that perspective taking helps realize the creative benefits of diversity of perspectives by fostering information elaboration. Results of a laboratory experiment support the hypothesized interaction between diversity and perspective taking on team creativity. Diverse teams performed more creatively than homogeneous teams when they engaged in perspective taking, but not when they were not instructed to take their team members’ perspectives. Team information elaboration was found to mediate this moderated effect and was associated with a stronger indirect effect than mere information sharing or task conflict. Our results point to perspective taking as an important mechanism to unlock diversity’s potential for team creativity.},

  abstract = {The aim of this paper is to examine the mediating role played by five key job characteristics in the relationship between employee participation in a job redesign intervention and employee well-being. In studies of job redesign interventions, it has been assumed that any effects of employee participation in job redesign on well-being are a result of changes in job characteristics rather than participation in change per se. It is therefore important to statistically test for mediation in job redesign intervention studies to help establish that the change in job characteristics is the mechanism through which job redesign interventions work. However, this has rarely been tested directly, either because data to allow tests of mediation have not been collected (e.g. assessments of job characteristics) or because data have been collected but mediation has not been tested using accepted procedures. This makes it unclear whether changes in job characteristics explain the effects. Results from multilevel analyses of a longitudinal 9-month long serendipitous quasi-experimental participative job redesign intervention showed that changes in job control, participation, skill utilization and feedback, but not task obstacles, were sufficient to account for the relationship between the intervention and employee well-being.

Interestingly, however, the previously reported effects of diversity training are often weak and, sometimes, even negative. This situation calls for research on the conditions under which diversity training helps or harms teams. We propose that diversity training can increase team creativity, but only for teams with less positive pretraining diversity beliefs (i.e., teams with a greater need for such training) and that are sufficiently diverse in nationality. Comparing the creativity of teams that attended nationality diversity training versus control training, we found that for teams with less positive diversity beliefs, diversity training increased creative performance when the team’s nationality diversity was high, but undermined creativity when the team’s nationality diversity was low. Diversity training had less impact on teams with more positive diversity beliefs, and training effects were not contingent upon these teams’ diversity. Speaking to the underlying process, we showed that these interactive effects were driven by the experienced team efficacy of the team members. We discuss theoretical and practical implications for nationality diversity management.},

  abstract = {A fundamental tenet of Leader–Member Exchange (LMX) theory is that leaders develop different quality relationships with their employees; however, little research has investigated the impact of LMX differentiation on employee reactions. The current research investigates whether perceptions of LMX variability (the extent to which LMX relationships are perceived to vary within a team) affects employee job satisfaction and wellbeing beyond the effects of personal LMX quality. As LMX variability runs counter to principles of equality and consistency, which are important for maintaining social harmony in groups, it is hypothesized that perceptions of LMX variability will have a negative effect on employee reactions, via its negative impact on perceived team relations. Two samples of employed individuals were used to investigate the hypothesized relationships. In both samples, an individual's perception of LMX variability in their team was negatively related to employee job satisfaction and wellbeing (above the effects of LMX), and this relationship was mediated by reports of relational team conflict.},

  abstract = {The Hawk-Dove game (Maynard Smith, 1982) has been used to analyse conflicts over resources such as food. At the evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS), either a proportion p* of animals always play Hawk, or each animal has a probability p* of playing Hawk. We modify the standard Hawk-Dove game to include a state variable, x, that represents the animal's level of energy reserves. A strategy is now a rule for choosing an action as a function of x and time of day. We consider a non-reproductive period and adopt the criterion of minimizing mortality over this period. We find the ESS, which has the form 'play Hawk if reserves are below c*(t) at time t, otherwise play Dove'. This ESS is very different from the ESS in the standard HawkDove game. It is a pure ESS that depends on the animal's state and on time. Furthermore, it is characterized by the strong condition that any single mutant that does not adopt the ESS suffers a reduction in fitness. The standard Hawk-Dove game assumes pay-offs that are related to fitness; our approach starts from a definition of fitness and derives the pay-offs in the process of finding the ESS. When the environment becomes worse (e.g. food becomes less reliable or energy expenditure increases) the ESS changes in such a way as to increase the proportion of animals that will play Hawk.},

The findings address prior inconsistencies regarding the relationships between leader traits and team effectiveness, identify an important boundary condition and key team processes that bridge the links, and provide a deeper understanding of the role of leader traits in teams.},

Drawing on social exchange theory and the theory of moral disengagement, we propose that job insecurity increases workplace deviance and intentions to leave by encouraging employees to morally disengage. We further propose that the strength of the positive association between job insecurity, moral disengagement, and these outcomes is contingent upon 2 aspects of the situation -- employees' perceived employment opportunities outside the organization and the quality of the exchange relationship they have developed with their supervisors (leader-member exchange, or LMX). Two time-lagged studies of Chinese workers provide support for the hypothesized 1st-stage moderated mediation model. Specifically, the indirect effect of job insecurity on organizational and interpersonal deviance and intentions to leave via moral disengagement was positive and significant when individuals had more employment opportunities or when LMX was lower but not when they had fewer employment opportunities or when LMX was higher.

Using these ratings from 7 months of games from over 3 million players, we look at how play intensity, breaks in play, skill change over time, and other games affect skill. These analyzed factors are then combined to model future skill and games played; the results show that skill change in early matches is a useful metric for modeling future skill, while play intensity explains eventual games played. The best players in the 7-month period, who we call “Master Blasters”, have varied skill patterns that often run counter to the trends we see for typical players. The data analysis is supplemented with a 70 person survey to explore how players’ selfperceptions compare to the gameplay data; most survey responses align well with the data and provide insight into player beliefs and motivation. Finally, we wrap up with a discussion about hiding skill information from players, and implications for game designers.},

Drawing from social persuasion theory, we theorize that managers tend to give more positive evaluations to employees who engage in a moderate frequency of promotive/prohibitive voice than those who either rarely speak up or speak up very frequently. In Study 1, based on a sample from a Chinese bank, we found that leader-member exchange quality (LMX) moderated the inverted U-shaped linkage of prohibitive voice with manager-rated promotability of voicers, whereas the frequency of promotive voice was not related to promotability, irrespective of levels of LMX. In Study 2, using employee-reported voice frequency, rather than the manager-rated measures adopted in Study 1, we largely replicated the main findings of Study 1 based on a sample from an information technology firm in the United States. In Study 3, using another U.S. sample, from a financial services firm, we found that manager-perceived voice constructiveness mediated the curvilinear interactive effect of prohibitive voice (rather than promotive voice) and LMX on managers’ evaluations of employees’ overall performance.

  abstract = {While knowledge management research is gaining in popularity in various disciplines such as organizational behavior, communication, and information science, insufficient attention has been paid to work group members' motivation to share information through digital repositories. The goal of this study is to understand various factors associated with information sharing through digital repositories in small groups. To meet this goal, this study integrates explanations from six social-psychological and communication theories into a streamlined model based on the Multi-theoretical Multi-level (MTML) framework (Monge \& Contractor, 2003). Further, this study demonstrates that contextual factors in work groups may contribute to information sharing above and beyond individual level social-psychological factors. This study proposes a refined model (MTML 2.0) to advance the MTML based model by integrating four group contextual factors: trust, task interdependence, management expectation, and group norms.
This study also describes an empirical research and specifies the sample, procedures, and instrumentation. The findings in this study provide an example of the usefulness and complexity of the MTML theoretical models and social network analysis for small group knowledge management research. Moreover, the MTML 2.0 model proposed in this study has well complemented and extended the MTML based model by revealing important nuances beyond what was found by MTML model alone, and therefore MTML 2.0 has the potential to extend the multi-level dimension originally discussed in MTML and shed light on the interactive dynamics of various levels of analysis.
The major theoretical contributions of this study are: (i) extending research on knowledge networks by incorporation of non-human agents, adaptation of theories that were previously applied only to human-to-human context to human-to-non-human interaction context, and applying the MTML perspective to the explanation of knowledge allocation behaviors; (ii) explicating the nuances of explanatory power of multiple theories in a model, by taking into account the influence of organizational context. The main practical contributions are: (i) to help small groups design digital repositories so as to achieve their potential as shared resources; (ii) to help the management proactively design and implement desirable combinations of contextual factors in order to facilitate information sharing.},

  abstract = {This paper differs from previous examinations of organizational learning in that it is broader in scope and more evaluative of the literatures. Four constructs related to organizational learning (knowledge acquisition, information distribution, information interpretation, and organizational memory) are articulated, and the literatures related to each are described and critiqued. The literature on knowledge acquisition is voluminous and multi-faceted, and so the knowledge acquisition construct is portrayed here as consisting of five subconstructs or subprocesses: (1) drawing on knowledge available at the organization's birth, (2) learning from experience, (3) learning by observing other organizations, (4) grafting on to itself components that possess knowledge needed but not possessed by the organization, and (5) noticing or searching for information about the organization's environment and performance. Examination of the related literatures indicates that much has been learned about learning from experience, but also that there is a lack of cumulative work and a lack of integration of work from different research groups. Similarly, much has been learned about organizational search, but there is a lack of conceptual work, and there is a lack of both cumulative work and syntheses with which to create a more mature literature. Congenital learning, vicarious learning, and grafting are information acquisition subprocesses about which relatively little has been learned. The literature concerning information distribution is rich and mature, but an aspect of information distribution that is central to an organization's benefitting from its learning, namely how units that possess information and units that need this information can find each other quickly and with a high likelihood, is unexplored. Information interpretation, as an organizational process, rather than an individual process, requires empirical work for further advancement. Organizational memory is much in need of systematic investigation, particularly by those whose special concerns are improving organizational learning and decision making.},

In the present article, I therefore build on recovery theory and on evidence from chronobiological research and adopt a temporal research approach that allows investigating change trajectories in fatigue over the course of the day. Furthermore, the role of sleep quality and psychological detachment in these change trajectories is investigated. Hypotheses are tested in an experience-sampling study involving 133 employees who were asked to provide fatigue ratings 4 times a day over 5 consecutive workdays. Growth curve analyses revealed that on average fatigue decreased in the morning, reaching a nadir around midday and then increased until bedtime. Additionally, daily sleep quality explained variation in individuals’ fatigue change trajectories: When sleep quality was low, next day fatigue decreased between morning and midday and then increased again until bedtime; when sleep quality was high, fatigue remained stable until midday and then increased again between the end of work and bedtime. Theoretical implications for the recovery literature and practical implications are discussed in conclusion. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)},

  abstract = {The authors developed and meta-analytically examined hypotheses designed to test and extend work design theory by integrating motivational, social, and work context characteristics. Results from a summary of 259 studies and 219,625 participants showed that 14 work characteristics explained, on average, 43\% of the variance in the 19 worker attitudes and behaviors examined. For example, motivational characteristics explained 25\% of the variance in subjective performance, 2\% in turnover perceptions, 34\% in job satisfaction, 24\% in organizational commitment, and 26\% in role perception outcomes. Beyond motivational characteristics, social characteristics explained incremental variances of 9\% of the variance in subjective performance, 24\% in turnover intentions, 17\% in job satisfaction, 40\% in organizational commitment, and 18\% in role perception outcomes. Finally, beyond both motivational and social characteristics, work context characteristics explained incremental variances of 4\% in job satisfaction and 16\% in stress. The results of this study suggest numerous opportunities for the continued development of work design theory and practice.},

In particular, the OpenMx implementation of SSMs using the Kalman filter and prediction error decomposition is discussed. In reflection of modularity, the implementation uses the same full information maximum likelihood missing data procedures for SSMs and SEMs. Similarly, generic OpenMx features such as likelihood ratio tests, profile likelihood confidence intervals, Hessian-based standard errors, definition variables, and the matrix algebra interface are all supported. Example scripts for specification of autoregressive models, multiple lag models (VAR(p)), multiple lag moving average models (VARMA(p, q)), multiple subject models, and latent growth models are provided. Additionally, latent variable calculation based on the Kalman filter and raw data generation based on a model are all included. Finally, future work for extending SSMs to allow for random effects and for presenting them in diagrams is discussed.},

  abstract = {Employing 5 waves of measurement over a period of 10 years, we explored the effects of exposure to constellations of conditions at work on physical and psychological strain, estimating the history of exposure over time. Specifically, we first tested if the 4 constellations postulated by the job demand-control (JDC) model, extended to include social stressors, could be identified empirically over time through a person-centered analysis. Second, we tested 2 specific effects of the history of exposure on physical and psychological strain: cumulative effects (i.e., history of exposure predicting strain) and chronic effects (i.e., history of exposure being associated with reduced reversibility in strain). Data were collected from 483 respondents who were at the end of their vocational training. The results supported the hypotheses, in that not all JDC constellations could be empirically identified, the majority of participants was in rather favorable constellations, and the differences between constellations, in terms of levels of demands and control, were more subtle than suggested by theoretically predefined constellations. Because the linear and quadratic solutions were largely comparable, we decided to adopt the linear ones. The expected cumulative and chronic effects were mostly confirmed: Unfavorable JDC constellations were associated with poorer health and well-being than favorable ones, when controlling for the initial level of the respective outcome variable, demographic variables, and for cumulative private stressors (cumulative effects). These differences largely remained after further adjustments for current conditions at work (chronic effects). [web URL: http://psycnet.apa.org.proxy2.cl.msu.edu/PsycARTICLES/journal/apl/102/9]},

The methodology consists of (1) a generalized repeated-game strategy space, (2) a mapping between histories and repeated-game beliefs, and (3) asynchronous updating of repeatedgame strategies. We implement the proposed methodology by building on three proven action-learning models. Their predictions with repeated-game strategies are then validated with data from experiments with human subjects in four, symmetric 2 × 2 games: Prisoner’s Dilemma, Battle of the Sexes, Stag-Hunt, and Chicken. The models with repeatedgame strategies approximate subjects’ behavior substantially better than their respective models with action learning. Additionally, inferred rules of behavior in the experimental data overlap with the predicted rules of behavior.},

With confounded effects, it is not possible to establish the degree to which any 1 effect, including those related to exercises and dimensions, influences AC ratings. In the current study (N = 698) we used Bayesian generalizability theory to unconfound all of the possible effects contributing to variance in AC ratings. Our results show that ≤1.11\% of the variance in AC ratings was directly attributable to behavioral dimensions, suggesting that dimension-related effects have no practical impact on the reliability of ACs. Even when taking aggregation level into consideration, effects related to general performance and exercises accounted for almost all of the reliable variance in AC ratings. The implications of these findings for recent dimension- and exercise-based perspectives on ACs are discussed.

A particularly attractive feature of these models is that it is easy to decompose and interpret aspects of change. One particularly flexible model, the dual change score model, has two components of change: a proportional change component that depends on scores at the previous time point, and a constant change component that is additive. We demonstrate through simulation and an empirical example that in a correctly specified model, the correlation between the proportional change parameter and the mean of the constant change component can approach either −1 or 1, thus complicating interpretation. We provide recommendations and code to aid researchers’ ability to diagnose this issue in their own data.},

  abstract = {This study contributes to the literature on why selection procedures that are based on the behavioral consistency logic (e.g., structured interviews and assessment centers) are valid predictors of job performance. We rely on interactionist theories to propose that individual differences in assessing situational demands explain true variance in performance in selection procedures and on the job. Results from 124 individuals in a simulated selection process showed that the assessment of situational demands was related to both selection and job performance. Individual differences in assessing situational demands also contributed to the criterion-related validity of assessment center and structured interview ratings, offering a complementary explanation as to why selection procedures based on the notion of behavioral consistency predict job performance.

  abstract = {A literature-based model defining how task and person conflict modify the relationship between positive goal interdependence and decision-making effectiveness in management teams is presented. The model assumes that positive interdependence fosters effective decision making behaviors only if person conflict interferes with task conflict, but not in cases of one-sided task conflict, one-sided person conflict, or no conflict. Survey results obtained from 102 members of management teams illustrate this complex interactive effect of positive interdependence and type of conflict. The proposed refinement of the classic interdependence paradigm may advance recent theory and research on the role of type of conflict in team decision making.},

  abstract = {Psychological research has increasingly recognized the importance of integrating temporal dynamics into its theories, and innovations in longitudinal designs and analyses have allowed such theories to be formalized and tested. However, psychological researchers may be relatively unequipped to analyze such data, given its many characteristics and the general complexities involved in longitudinal modeling. The current paper introduces time series analysis to psychological research, an analytic domain that has been essential for understanding and predicting the behavior of variables across many diverse fields. First, the characteristics of time series data are discussed. Second, different time series modeling techniques are surveyed that can address various topics of interest to psychological researchers, including describing the pattern of change in a variable, modeling seasonal effects, assessing the immediate and long-term impact of a salient event, and forecasting future values. To illustrate these methods, an illustrative example based on online job search behavior is used throughout the paper, and a software tutorial in R for these analyses is provided in the Appendix.},

  abstract = {Although scholars in the field of organizational behavior have raised concerns about a lack of contextual appreciation, there has been a recent embrace of contextual thinking in the organizational sciences. In this review, I discuss several recent theories and measures of context. The added value of a contextual approach is illustrated by how context can shape personality, how it affects the emergence of work designs, and how it benefits the study of organizational demography. Future research topics include context cue sensitivity, the way context is shaped, the mediators of context effects, and the breadth and limits of contextual impact. A recurrent theme is that although context enables a demarcation of what is distinctive about situations, it also permits integration across research areas and levels of analysis, identifying what they have in common as settings for organizational behavior.},

Comparing and contrasting job attitudes with social attitudes, the present chapter presents various theoretical models of job attitudes. These theoretical approaches give rise to an integrative model which draws most heavily from the Cornell model of job attitudes. We then consider newer theoretical approaches, including engagement, affective events, personality, and unit-level satisfaction. Capitalizing on recent trends in personality, affect, and multilevel research, we also present a core self-evaluations multilevel model. We conclude with a discussion of measurement issues in job satisfaction research.},

This article surveys the field as it has been constituted in the past several years. Definitional issues are addressed first, in an attempt to clarify the nature, scope, and structure of job attitudes. The distinction between cognitive and affective bases of job attitudes has been an issue of debate, and recent research using within-persons designs has done much to inform this discussion. Recent research has also begun to reformulate the question of dispositional or situational influences on employee attitudes by addressing how these factors might work together to influence attitudes. Finally, there has also been a continual growth in research investigating how employee attitudes are related to a variety of behaviors at both the individual and aggregated level of analysis.},

  abstract = {Over the past 100 years, research on job attitudes has improved in the sophistication of methods and in the productive use of theory as a basis for fundamental research into questions of work psychology. Early research incorporated a diversity of methods for measuring potential predictors and outcomes of job attitudes. Over time, methods for statistically assessing these relationships became more rigorous, but the field also became narrower. In recent years, developments in theory and methodology have reinvigorated research, which now addresses a rich panoply of topics related to the daily flow of affect, the complexity of personal motives and dispositions, and the complex interplay of attitude objects and motivation in shaping behavior. Despite these apparent changes, a review of the concepts and substantive arguments that underpin this literature have remained remarkably consistent. We conclude by discussing how we expect that these major themes will be addressed in the future, emphasizing topics that have proven to be enduring guides for understanding the ways that people construe and react to their appraisals of their work.

Furthermore, this illusory sense of fairness derived from the mere presence of diversity structures causes high-status group members to legitimize the status quo by becoming less sensitive to discrimination targeted at underrepresented groups and reacting more harshly toward underrepresented group members who claim discrimination. Six experiments support these hypotheses in designs using 4 types of diversity structures (diversity policies, diversity training, diversity awards, idiosyncratically generated diversity structures from participants’ own organizations) among 2 high-status groups in tests involving several types of discrimination (discriminatory promotion practices, adverse impact in hiring, wage discrimination). Implications of these experiments for organizational diversity and employment discrimination law are discussed.},

  abstract = {This study examines two fundamental concerns in the context of organizational change: employees' perceptions of merger process justice and cognitive trust in the top management team. Our main purpose is to better understand the nature of reciprocal relations between these important constructs through a significant change event. Previous research, building mainly on social exchange theory, has framed trust as a consequence of justice perceptions. More recently, scholars have suggested that this view may be overly simplistic and that trust-related cognitions may also represent an important antecedent of justice perceptions. Using 3-wave longitudinal survey data (N = 622) gathered during a merger process, we tested reciprocal relations over time between cognitive trust in the top management team and perceptions of the merger process justice. In contrast to the conventional unidirectional notion of trust or trust-related cognitions as outcomes of perceived justice, our results show positive reciprocal relations over time between cognitive trust and justice. Our findings also revealed that the positive influence of cognitive trust on subsequent justice perceptions was slightly more robust than the opposite direction. By examining cross-lagged longitudinal relations between these critical psychological reactions, this study contributes across multiple domains of the management literature including trust, justice, and organizational mergers.

At the same time psychologists have argued that preferences are constructed via practice with decision problems. Do the day-to-day decisions of restaurants breed an overemphasis on costs? This paper uses data from surveys with restaurant owners to show that they weigh costs more than benefits and, in fact, that they are loss averse around a reference point of 0. It correlates their loss aversion with the demand elasticity they perceive, their propensity to take on risk, experience, among other factors. The correlation with experience is the only one that survives - i.e. owners with more experience are more loss averse.},

We use analytical results to demonstrate that error correction models are appropriate for stationary data. We use simulated data to then demonstrate the equivalency between auto-distributed lag models and error correction models. Finally, we reestimate a model of Supreme Court approval from the literature to demonstrate how the use of an error correction model enhances our understanding of political dynamics.},

From COR theory, we posit that employees’ motivation to acquire and protect resources explains why they become embedded and how they behave once embedded. Our COR-based JE model highlights contextual antecedents that clarify how employees become embedded within different foci. Its multifoci theoretical lens also illustrates how different forms of work-focused embeddedness differentially affect work outcomes and how they interact with nonwork foci to influence those outcomes. Along with directions for further research, we further discuss theoretical and practical implications of our integrative formulation.},

The present study examined cortical event-related potential correlates of task switching and switch costs in 39 participants during a cued match/mismatch discrimination task. Compared with non-switch trials, switch trials were associated with a larger cue-related, anticipatory P3b-like waveform. Switch trials were also associated with smaller target-related, stimulus-dependent P2 and P3-like components. Moreover, the switch-related amplitude variability in the P3b to the cue and the P2 to the target were associated with unique components of the residual switch costs. The results support an integrated model of task switching with complementary yet distinct roles for anticipatory and stimulus-dependent processes in task switching and switch costs.},

  abstract = {Despite the long-standing discussion on fixed effects (FE) and random effects (RE) models, how and under which conditions both methods can eliminate unmeasured confounding bias have not yet been widely understood in practice. Using a simple pretest-posttest design, this article translates the conventional algebraic formalization of FE and RE models into causal graphs and provides intuitively accessible graphical explanations about their data-generating and biasremoving processes. The proposed causal graphs highlight that FE and RE models consider different data-generating models. RE models presume a data-generating model that is identical to a randomized controlled trial while FE models allow for unobserved time-invariant treatmentoutcome confounding. Augmenting regular causal graphs that describe data-generating processes by adding the computational structures of FE and RE estimators, the article visualizes how FE estimators (gain score and deviation score estimators) and RE estimators (quasi-deviation score estimator) offset unmeasured confounding bias. In contrast to standard regression or matching estimators that reduce confounding bias by blocking non-causal paths via conditioning, FE and RE estimators offset confounding bias by deliberately creating new non-causal paths and associations of opposite sign. Though FE and RE estimators are similar in their bias-offsetting mechanisms, the augmented graphs reveal their subtle differences that can result in different biases in observational studies.},

  abstract = {Corporate transfers are made within multi-plant organizations and are sensitive to organizational factors which impose a set of restricted internal labor market job opportunities and limited destination choices upon the potential mover. Both these factors influence the variable sets available to the decision-maker. To evaluate these differences, a framework of corporate transfers is suggested and empirically evaluated. An analysis of the intent to move in an Israeli multi-plant corporation showed such potential movement to be extensive. Factors affecting a decision to move between plants more closely resembled the process involved in migration than turnover. The availability of housing assistance and the desire for a more varied and diversified life played key roles in the decision to move between corporate plants. Destination choices were guided by a similarity between a potential migrant and the character of the population at alternative destinations. These results suggest that the decision process involved in corporate transfers are related more to a residential than to a job change. With increasing numbers of the labor force employed with multi-plant corporations, greater attention must be paid to this type of potential manpower flow and factors influencing it.},

Usually, however, such datasets have substantial sample size in the cross-section dimension (N), whereas T is often a single-digit number. Results on the asymptotic bias (N + co ) in this situation have been published a decade ago, but, hence far, analytic small sample assessments of the actual bias have not been presented. Here we derive a formula for the bias of the Least-Squares Dummy Variable (LSDV) estimator which has a O(N -’ T -312) approximation error. In a simulation study this is found to be remarkably accurate. Due to the small variance of the LSDV estimator, which is usually much smaller than the v,ariance of consistent (Generalized) Method of Moments estimators, a very efficient procedure results when we remove the bias from the LSDV estimator. The simulations contain results for a particular operational corrected LSDV estimation procedure which in many situations proves to be (much) more efficient than various instrumental variable type estimators.},

Within-group agreement is a key consideration in the measurement of such constructs, yet antecedents of within-group agreement have been little studied. The authors found that group member social interaction and work interdependence were significantly positively related to within-group agreement regarding perceptions of the work environment. Demographic heterogeneity was not significantly related to within-group agreement. Survey wording showed a complex relationship to agreement. Both evaluative items and socially undesirable items generated high within-group agreement. The use of a group rather than individual referent increased within-group agreement in response to descriptive items but decreased within-group agreement in response to evaluative items. Items with a group referent showed greater between-group variability than items with an individual referent. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)},

Three frequently-run offensive plays were broken down into a series of five behaviorally defined stages, permitting construction of checklists suitable for observing the players during both game and scrimmage sessions. The intervention consisted of the presentation and explanation of the appropriate checklist, and frequent contingent reinforcement in the form of feedback and recognition for instances of desired play execution. Performance gains averaging 20\% occurred for each of the three plays after, and not before, the staggered introduction of each intervention.

Desired safety practices were identified, permitting construction of observational codes suitable for observing workers' on-the-job performance over a 25-week period of time. The intervention consisted of an explanation and visual presentation of the desired behaviors, as well as frequent, low-cost reinforcement in the form of feedback. A within-subject (multiple baseline) design was used. Employees in the 2 departments substantially improved their safety performance from 70\% and 78\% to 96\% and 99\% in the wrapping and makeup departments, respectively, after the staggered introduction of the program. During the reversal phase, performance returned to baseline (71\% and 72\%). It was concluded that the intervention, particularly the frequent feedback, was effective in improving safety performance. Not only did employees react favorably to the program, but the company was later able to maintain the program with a continuing decline in the injury frequency rate. The results suggest that behaviorally defining and positively reinforcing safe practices is a visible approach to the occupational accident reduction.},

  abstract = {Desired safety practices were behaviorally defined for 4 sections of a city's vehicle maintenance division; a total of 55 employees differing in age and seniority participated. A total of 165 observations were conducted over 45 wks. A multiple-baseline design with a reversal component was used in which 5 conditions were introduced: (a) baseline, (b) Training Only 1 (desired practices were discussed, illustrated, and posted), (c) Training and Feedback 1 (supervisors observed daily and provided feedback about the section safety level on graphs), (d) Training Only 2, and (e) Training and Feedback 2. Whereas employees showed only slight improvements during the Training Only 1 phase, their performance increased substantially during the Training and Feedback 1 phase. At this point, it was concluded that the provision of training alone is not a sufficient means of improving and maintaining performance. This conclusion was confirmed during the Training Only 2 phase when performance declined. Performance improved once again during the Training and Feedback 2 phase, but only when feedback was provided at least 3 times/wk. This qualification raises questions concerning the maintenance of performance gains and supervisory support. (31 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

The purpose of the present study is to assess whether classroom events, which are often granted but infrequently evaluated, can be used as reinforcers for achievement. Students' performance is compared under a contingency and a noncontingency condition, using a repeated measures factorial design. Students perform better when they can earn points toward options such as the opportunity to drop low scores, be excused from the final examination, and turn in work for extra credit. It is concluded that events such as these should not be ignored and that they should be considered seriously whenever designing a course.},

In line with research on cultural diversity, results indicated performance benefits as the percentage of immigrant students increased across nations. Interestingly, these effects remained significant for both native and immigrant students, once several other predictors of test performance at the national, school, and individual levels were controlled for. These findings challenge the assumption that the increasing presence of immigrant students in educational institutions represents a threat to native students’ academic performance. Potential mechanisms are proposed and discussed, offering new avenues for research.},

  abstract = {Why do employees perceive that they have been treated fairly by their supervisor? Theory and research on justice generally presumes a straightforward answer to this question: Because the supervisor adhered to justice rules. We propose the answer is not so straightforward and that employee justice perceptions are not merely “justice-laden.” Drawing from theory on information processing that distinguishes between automatic and systematic modes, we suggest that employee justice perceptions are also “ethics-laden.” Specifically, we posit that employees with more ethical supervisors form justice perceptions through automatic processing with little scrutiny of or attention paid to a supervisor’s justice acts. In contrast, employees with less ethical supervisors rely on systematic processing to evaluate their supervisor’s justice enactment and form justice perceptions. Thus, we propose that ethical leadership substitutes for the supervisor’s justice enactment. Our results demonstrate support for the interactive effect of supervisor justice enactment and ethical leadership on employee justice perceptions, and we further demonstrate its consequences for employees’ engagement in discretionary behaviors (citizenship and counterproductive behaviors). Our findings highlight an assumption in the justice literature in need of revision and opens the door to further inquiry about the role of information processing in justice perceptions.

  abstract = {Although the general picture in the organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) literature is that OCB has positive consequences for employees and organizations, an emerging stream of work has begun to examine the potential negative consequences of OCB for actors. Drawing from the cognitive-affective processing system framework and conservation of resources theory, we present an integrative model that simultaneously examines the benefits and costs of daily OCB for actors. Utilizing an experience sampling methodology through which 82 employees were surveyed for 10 workdays, we find that daily OCB is associated with positive affect, but it also interferes with perceptions of work goal progress. Positive affect and work goal progress in turn mediate the effects of OCB on daily well-being. Moreover, employees' trait regulatory focus influences the strength of the daily relationships between OCB and its positive and negative outcomes. We conclude by discussing theoretical and practical implications of our multilevel model.},

  abstract = {Several of the most valid predictors used to make employment decisions create a diversity-validity dilemma (Pyburn, Ployhart, \& Kravitz, this issue, 2008). This diversity-validity dilemma can be resolved by (a) reducing adverse impact through a variety of technical steps (Ployhart \& Holtz, this issue, 2008) or (b) using affirmative action to increase representation of the disadvantaged groups. This paper focuses on the second approach. The paper begins with a very brief review of the legal bases of affirmative action and a summary of the research on affirmative action attitudes. This is followed with reviews of research on the ongoing existence of workplace discrimination, the economic impact of affirmative action on target groups and organizations, and stigmatization of target group members by others and by target group members themselves. Most problems with affirmative action apply only or primarily to preference-based forms, so nonpreferential approaches to affirmative action are recommended to increase the attraction, selection, inclusion, and retention of underrepresented group members.

We suggest that one reason people commit this planning fallacy is that they do not naturally ‘‘unpack’’ multifaceted tasks (e.g., writing a manuscript) into subcomponents (completing the literature review, general discussion, references section, etc.) when making predictions. We tested this interpretation by asking participants to estimate how long it would take them to complete one of several tasks: holiday shopping in Experiment 1, ‘‘getting ready’’ for a date in Experiment 2, formatting a document in Experiments 3 and 5, and preparing food in Experiment 4. Participants prompted to unpack the task provided longer—and, in Experiments 3–4, less biased—estimates of how long the task would take than did participants who did not. Experiment 5 showed that the debiasing influence of unpacking is moderated by task complexity: the more multifaceted the task, the greater the influence of unpacking.},

  abstract = {A popular distinction in cognitive and social psychology has been between intuitive and deliberate judgments. This juxtaposition has aligned in dual-process theories of reasoning associative, unconscious, effortless, heuristic, and suboptimal processes (assumed to foster intuitive judgments) versus rule-based, conscious, effortful, analytic, and rational processes (assumed to characterize deliberate judgments). In contrast, we provide convergent arguments and evidence for a unified theoretical approach to both intuitive and deliberative judgments. Both are rule-based, and in fact, the very same rules can underlie both intuitive and deliberate judgments. The important open question is that of rule selection, and we propose a 2-step process in which the task itself and the individual’s memory constrain the set of applicable rules, whereas the individual’s processing potential and the (perceived) ecological rationality of the rule for the task guide the final selection from that set. Deliberate judgments are not generally more accurate than intuitive judgments; in both cases, accuracy depends on the match between rule and environment: the rules’ ecological rationality. Heuristics that are less effortful and in which parts of the information are ignored can be more accurate than cognitive strategies that have more information and computation. The proposed framework adumbrates a unified approach that specifies the critical dimensions on which judgmental situations may vary and the environmental conditions under which rules can be expected to be successful.},

The application of these models to longitudinal data assumes that the data-generating mechanism behind the psychological process under investigation contains only a deterministic trend. However, if a process, at least partially, contains a stochastic trend, then random coefficient regression results are likely to be spurious. This problem is demonstrated via a data example, previous research on simple regression models, and Monte Carlo simulations. A data analytic strategy is proposed to help researchers avoid making inaccurate inferences when observed trends may be due to stochastic processes.

  abstract = {People tend to update beliefs about their future outcomes in a valence-dependent way: they are likely to incorporate good news and to neglect bad news. However, belief formation is a complex process which depends not only on motivational factors such as the desire for favorable conclusions, but also on multiple cognitive variables such as prior beliefs, knowledge about personal vulnerabilities and resources, and the size of the probabilities and estimation errors. Thus, we applied computational modeling in order to test for valence-induced biases in updating while formally controlling for relevant cognitive factors. We compared biased and unbiased Bayesian models of belief updating, and specified alternative models based on reinforcement learning. The experiment consisted of 80 trials with 80 different adverse future life events. In each trial, participants estimated the base rate of one of these events and estimated their own risk of experiencing the event before and after being confronted with the actual base rate. Belief updates corresponded to the difference between the two self-risk estimates. Valence-dependent updating was assessed by comparing trials with good news (better-than-expected base rates) with trials with bad news (worse-than-expected base rates). After receiving bad relative to good news, participants’ updates were smaller and deviated more strongly from rational Bayesian predictions, indicating a valence-induced bias. Model comparison revealed that the biased (i.e., optimistic) Bayesian model of belief updating better accounted for data than the unbiased (i.e., rational) Bayesian model, confirming that the valence of the new information influenced the amount of updating. Moreover, alternative computational modeling based on reinforcement learning demonstrated higher learning rates for good than for bad news, as well as a moderating role of personal knowledge. Finally, in this specific experimental context, the approach based on reinforcement learning was superior to the Bayesian approach. The computational validation of valence-dependent belief updating represents a novel support for a genuine optimism bias in human belief formation. Moreover, the precise control of relevant cognitive variables justifies the conclusion that the motivation to adopt the most favorable self-referential conclusions biases human judgments.},

Yet this relationship does not fully mirror events as they occur in an employment relationship where employees’ promises and delivery of inducements and contributions are ongoing, and relatively continuous. Our premise is that promising and delivering contributions may enhance or reduce employees’ trust in and commitment to the organization depending on how well they fulfill psychological needs. We tested a social exchange theory model and our alternative model. Survey results favoured our alternative model and suggested that employees’ contributions were related to trust and commitment, independent of the role of inducements. Tests of the social exchange model exhibited worse fit to the data. Breach and fulfilment results from polynomial regression and response surface analyses revealed that commitment was higher when delivered contributions equal promised contributions and declined when delivered amounts were deficient of, or exceeded, promised amounts. Employees’ promised and delivered contributions to organizations may constitute a path to their feelings of commitment, but commitment was highest when delivered contributions were within close range of promised amounts.},

Despite these advantages, there may be some costs of smartphone use for work at night. Drawing from ego depletion theory, we examined whether smartphone use depletes employees’ regulatory resources and impairs their engagement at work the following day. Across two studies using experience sampling methodology, we found that smartphone use for work at night increased depletion the next morning via its effects on sleep. Morning depletion in turn diminished daily work engagement. The indirect effects of smartphone use on depletion and engagement the next day were incremental to the effects of other electronic devices (e.g., computer, tablet, and television use). We also found some support that the negative effects of morning depletion on daily work engagement may be buffered by job control, such that depletion impairs work engagement only for employees who experience low job control.},

Although recent theory suggests that helping may come at a cost to the helper, the majority of the helping literature has focused on the benefits of helping. The current study addresses the complex nature of helping by simultaneously considering its costs and benefits for helpers. Using daily diary data across 3 consecutive work weeks, we examine the relationship between responding to help requests, perceived prosocial impact of helping, and helpers' regulatory resources. We find that responding to help requests depletes regulatory resources at an increasing rate, yet perceived prosocial impact of helping can replenish resources. We also find that employees' prosocial motivation moderates these within-person relationships, such that prosocial employees are depleted to a larger extent by responding to help requests, and replenished to a lesser extent by the perceived prosocial impact of helping. Understanding the complex relationship of helping with regulatory resources is important because such resources have downstream effects on helpers' behavior in the workplace. We discuss the implications of our findings for both theory and practice. [web URL: http://psycnet.apa.org.proxy1.cl.msu.edu/journals/apl/101/8/1097/]},

Consequently, we expect workplace mistreatment will have the greatest effect on individuals who are sensitive to the presence and absence of negative stimuli – or those with a strong avoidance temperament. Although this may be the rule for most mistreatment constructs, we argue that ostracism may be the exception. Using an approach/avoidance framework to highlight unique elements of ostracism, we build on the definition of ostracism as being the absence of an expected positive stimulus (i.e., social interaction that is withheld) to argue ostracism should have the greatest impact on those who are sensitive to the presence and absence of positive stimuli – or those with a strong approach temperament. Across a scenario study, a study of student teams, and a field study, we found that a strong approach temperament exacerbated the effects of ostracism on citizenship behaviors, while a strong avoidance temperament did not. Implications for the ostracism and mistreatment literatures are discussed.},

  abstract = {Organizational researchers have long been interested in studying bottom-up multilevel processes where lower level units (e.g., employees) in organizations interact to jointly create characteristics of higher level units (e.g., work groups). This article contributes to the literature on bottom-up processes by detailing a statistical approach—the consensus emergence model (CEM)—that allows researchers to study emergence of shared perceptions and feelings or climates in groups over time. The described methodological approach extends standard multilevel methodology by examining residual variances within a growth model to account for dynamic change in group consensus. The CEM provides a formal test for consensus emergence. The approach also allows researchers to test explanatory models of consensus emergence by including personlevel, group-level, and observation-level predictors. We illustrate the CEM by applying the method to data from two longitudinal studies of work units. The first study investigated job satisfaction in military companies. Our second study examined professional archeologists working in groups on a field excavation mission and focused on fatigue at the end of the work day. Our analyses demonstrate the CEM's ability to detect and study emergence, and suggest that the CEM may be a valuable tool to help extend the study of emergence in organizational research.},

Analyses of residualized gain scores found apparently detrimental effects of all corrective actions by parents and professionals on subsequent antisocial behavior and hyperactivity. In contrast, analyses of simple gain scores found only apparently beneficial effects. Temporally reversed analyses yielded the same pattern of results, consistent with selection biases and regression artifacts, not with unidirectional causal effects. The findings were similar for corrective actions by professionals (e.g., Ritalin, psychotherapy) and by parents (physical and nonphysical punishment, scolding/yelling, ‘‘hostile-ineffective’’ parenting). Longitudinal analyses should check for similar artifacts by implementing temporally-reversed analyses and by determining whether causally relevant coefficients would replicate without artifacts biased in their favor.},

Results of a factor analysis indicate that job-involvement attitudes, higher order need-satisfaction attitudes, and intrinsic-motivation attitudes should be thought of as separate and distinct kinds of attitudes toward a job. These 3 types of attitudes related differentially to job design factors and to job behavior. Satisfaction proved to be related to such job characteristics as the amount of control the job allowed the holder and the degree to which it is seen to be relevant to the holder's valued abilities. Satisfaction was not related to either self-rated effort or performance. Job involvement, like satisfaction, bore a significant relationship to certain job characteristics; unlike satisfaction, however, involvement was positively related to self-rated effort. Intrinsic motivation was less strongly related to the job characterisitcs measured, but was more strongly related to both effort and performance than was either satisfaction or involvement. (15 ref.)

This chapter offers a review of DT research, with a particular focus on research relevant to the organizational sciences. We begin with a definition of personality in general and the traits of the DT in particular, including a discussion of the clinical and subclinical variants of these traits. We then review literature linking the DT traits to an array of organizational outcomes, discuss how the DT traits may be assessed, and conclude with recommendations for future work.},

Using the data from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS; National Center for Educational Statistics [NCES], 2013), the present study examines the relationship between women’s representation in university top administration and faculty positions and the 2 main areas of Title IX compliance among the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I institutions: passing the first prong of the “substantial proportionality” test and women’s share of total per team expenditures. The findings indicate that while women’s representation in top administrative positions does not explain the institution’s Title IX compliance, their representation in pretenure faculty positions is positively, though weakly, associated with compliance in terms of women’s share of per-team expenditure. The results also suggest that the representation of women in state legislatures is positively associated with Title IX compliance of public institutions, but not with private institutions’ compliance.},

We present empirical evidence that suggests people use threshold-based models to make decisions, choosing the first currently maximal number that exceeds a fixed threshold for that position in the list. We then develop a hierarchical generative account of this model family, and use Bayesian methods to learn about the parameters of the generative process, making inferences about the threshold decision models people use. We discuss the interesting aspects of human performance on the task, including the lack of learning, and the presence of large individual differences, and consider the possibility of extending the modeling framework to account for individual differences. We also use the modeling results to discuss the merits of hierarchical, generative and Bayesian models of cognitive processes more generally.},

  abstract = {The HEXACO model presents a conceptualization of personality that includes the trait honesty-humility (H-H) in addition to 5 other personality traits (i.e., agreeableness, conscientiousness, emotionality, extraversion, openness) that closely approximate the ubiquitous five-factor model (FFM) of personality. A substantial literature has accumulated supporting the structure of the HEXACO model and the construct validity of the H-H trait in particular. A newer development is the appearance of H-H in the applied psychology literature. This begs the question of whether H-H exhibits significant criterion-related validity with respect to job performance and whether H-H accounts for incremental validity over other established individual differences predictors of job performance. Accordingly, the purpose of this study is to conduct a meta-analysis of the relationship between H-H and 3 major dimensions of job performance (counterproductive work behavior [CWB], organizational citizenship behavior [OCB], and task performance) and compare the incremental validity of H-H with other established individual differences predictors (general mental ability, the FFM, and integrity tests). Our results indicate that H-H correlates −.44 with CWB, .13 with OCB, and .15 with task performance (each correlation corrected for unreliability in both the independent and dependent variables). Further, H-H demonstrated incremental validity over the other individual differences predictors in the case of CWB but not OCB and task performance.

We hypothesized that the belief that honesty is effortful predicts subsequent dishonest behavior because it facilitates one’s ability to justify such actions. In Study 1 ( N = 210), we developed an implicit measure of people’s beliefs about whether honesty is effortful, and we found that this lay theory predicts dishonesty. In Study 2 ( N = 339), we experimentally manipulated individuals’ lay theories about honesty and effort and found that an individual’s lay theory that honesty is effortful increased subsequent dishonesty. In Study 3, we manipulated (Study 3a; N = 294) and measured (Study 3b; N = 153) lay theories, and then manipulated the strength of situational force that encourages dishonesty, and found that an individual’s lay theory influences subsequent dishonesty only in a weak situation, where individuals have more agency to interpret the situation. This research provides novel insights into how our lay theories linking honesty and effort can help us rationalize our dishonesty, independent of whether a particular moral decision requires effort or not.

  abstract = {Until recently, research disclosing the specific antecedents that induce proactive job crafting activities has been relatively lacking. Particularly, despite theoretical studies that imply the importance of work meaningfulness as a critical motivational factor for positive workplace behaviors, previous research has not observed this firsthand. Therefore, for the first time, the present study empirically assesses work meaningfulness as a key element in prompting job crafting, an individually induced job redesign strategy. The purpose of the present study is to explain the respective original job crafting concepts (i.e., task, cognitive, and relational crafting) by employing a job demands-resources (JD-R) approach, which integrates the original job crafting dimensions and JD-R-based classification of job crafting. Additionally, the present study examines boundary conditions centered on social and job resources that may further stimulate job crafting. It was posited, based upon three three-way interaction models, that social identification (i.e., social resource) and task interdependence (i.e., job resource) are moderators that strengthen the relationship between work meaningfulness and each of the respective job crafting activities. Analyzing survey data from 195 individuals in 25 organizations from private and public sectors, the results indicated that task and relational crafting were both highest when work meaningfulness, task interdependence, and social identification were all high, thus partly supporting the proposed research hypotheses.},

One reason for this persistent research gap could be that organizational scholars are not aware of the methodological advances that are available today for modeling temporal interactions and detecting behavioral patterns that emerge over time. To facilitate such awareness, this Methods Corner contribution provides a hands-on tutorial for capturing and quantifying temporal behavioral patterns and for leveraging rich interaction data in organizational settings. We provide an overview of different approaches and methodologies for examining temporal interaction patterns, along with detailed information about the type of data that needs to be gathered in order to apply each method as well as the analytical steps (and available software options) involved in each method. Specifically, we discuss and illustrate lag sequential analysis, pattern analysis, statistical discourse analysis, and visualization methods for identifying temporal patterns in interaction data. We also provide key takeaways for integrating these methods more firmly in the field of organizational research and for moving interaction analytical research forward.},

  abstract = {The consensus in the emotional labor literature is that surface acting is “bad” for employees. However, the evidence on which this consensus is based has been derived from contexts emphasizing the display of positive emotions, such as customer service. Despite the acknowledgment that many contexts also require the display of negative emotions, scholarly work has proceeded under the assumption that surface acting is harmful regardless of the valence of the emotion being displayed. In this study, we take a hedonic approach to well-being and challenge the consensus that surface acting is bad for employees by examining its effects on changes in emotional exhaustion and job satisfaction, through changes in positive and negative affect, for both positive and negative emotional displays. Using a within-person approach, we focus on managers, whose occupation calls for displays of both positive and negative emotions. Our 3-week, experience-sampling study of 79 managers revealed that faking positive emotions decreases positive affect, which harms well-being more than authentically displaying such emotions. In contrast and counter to what the extant literature would suggest, faking negative emotions decreases negative affect and increases positive affect, which benefits well-being more than authentically displaying such emotions. We further integrate construal level theory with hedonic approaches of emotion to identify trait construal level as an important boundary condition to explain for whom surface acting is harmful versus beneficial.},

As a result, contemporary team research tends to focus on how team overall properties (e.g., the average of team personality and behavior) affect team processes and effectiveness while overlooking the potential unique influences of specific members on team outcomes. Drawing on minority influence theory (Grant \& Patil, 2012), we extend previous teams research by demonstrating that an extra miler (i.e., a team member exhibiting the highest frequency of extra-role behaviors in a team) can influence team processes and, ultimately, team effectiveness beyond the influences of all the other members. Specifically, based on a field study, we report that the extra miler’s behavioral influences (i.e., helping and voice) on team monitoring and backup processes and team effectiveness are contingent on his or her network position in the team, such that the member tends to have stronger influence on team outcomes when he or she is in a central position. We also find that even a single extra miler in a vital position plays a more important role in driving team processes and outcomes than do all the other members. Therefore, our research offers an important contribution to the team literature by demonstrating the disproportionate influences of specific team members on team overall outcomes.

With the increasing recognition of the importance of time, it is informative to examine a question critical to the dispositional view of job satisfaction: Are genetic influences on job satisfaction stable across different time points? Drawing upon dispositional and situational perspectives on job satisfaction and recent research in developmental behavioral genetics, we examined whether the relative potency of genetic (i.e., the person) and environmental influences on job satisfaction changed over time in a 3-wave longitudinal twin study. Biometric behavioral genetics analyses showed that genetic influences accounted for 31.2\% of the variance in job satisfaction measured at approximately Age 21, which was markedly greater than the 18.7\% and 19.8\% of variance explained by genetic factors at Age 25 and Age 30. Such genetic influences were mediated via positive affectivity and negative affectivity, but not via general mental ability. After partialing out genetic influences, environmental influences on job satisfaction were related to interpersonal conflict at work and occupational status, and these influences were relatively stable across the 3 time points. These results offer important implications for organizations and employees to better understand and implement practices to enhance job satisfaction.},

  abstract = {Ellsberg and others suggested that decision under ambiguity is a rich empirical domain with many phenomena to be investigated beyond the Ellsberg urns. We provide a systematic empirical investigation of this richness by varying the uncertain events, the outcomes, and combinations of both. Although ambiguity aversion is prevailing, we also find systematic ambiguity seeking, confirming insensitivity. We find that ambiguity attitudes depend on the kind of uncertainty (the source) but not on the kind of outcomes. Ambiguity attitudes are closer to rationality (ambiguity neutrality) for natural uncertainties than for artificial Ellsberg urn uncertainties. This also appears from the reductions of monotonicity violations and of insensitivity. Ambiguity attitudes have predictive power across different outcomes and sources of uncertainty, with individual-specific components. Our rich domain serves well to test families of weighting functions for fitting ambiguity attitudes. We find that two-parameter families, capturing not only aversion but also insensitivity, are desirable for ambiguity even more than for risk. The Goldstein–Einhorn family performed best for ambiguity.},

  abstract = {Past reviews and meta-analyses typically conceptualized and examined selection procedures as holistic entities. We draw on the product design literature to propose a modular approach as a complementary perspective to conceptualizing selection procedures. A modular approach means that a product is broken down into its key underlying components. Therefore, we start by presenting a modular framework that identifies the important measurement components of selection procedures. Next, we adopt this modular lens for reviewing the available evidence regarding each of these components in terms of affecting validity, subgroup differences, and applicant perceptions, as well as for identifying new research directions. As a complement to the historical focus on holistic selection procedures, we posit that the theoretical contributions of a modular approach include improved insight into the isolated workings of the different components underlying selection procedures and greater theoretical connectivity among different selection procedures and their literatures. We also outline how organizations can put a modular approach into operation to increase the variety in selection procedures and to enhance the flexibility in designing them. Overall, we believe that a modular perspective on selection procedures will provide the impetus for programmatic and theory-driven research on the different measurement components of selection procedures.

So far, this broader more contemporary trait conceptualization has made few inroads into assessment practices. Therefore, this study focuses on the assessment and predictive power of people’s intraindividual variability across situations. In three studies (either in student or employee samples), both test-takers’ mean trait scores and the variability of their responses across multiple written job-related situations of a situational judgment test (SJT) were assessed. Results revealed that people’s intraindividual variability (a) was related to their self-rated functional flexibility, (b) predicted performance above their mean scores, and (c) predicted their actual personality state variability over 10 days. These results open opportunities for complementing traditional selection procedures with more dynamic indices in assessment.

We further found that citizenship pressure enhanced the positive relationship between episodic autonomous motivation and positive affect. Overall, the results challenge the universality of the “doing good-feeling good” effect, and explicate the joint roles of citizenship pressure and helpers’ episodic motivation in influencing employees’ positive affect and their subsequent helping behaviors.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this study is to examine the hypothesis that collective efficacy and self-efficacy influence both the amount of effort expended by members of a group and the performance of the group under both high and low levels of task interdependence. Additionally, to improve our understanding of collective efficacy, two determinants of collective efficacy are hypothesized and examined: perceived adequacy of members' skills and perceived group coordination capability.
The study revolves around an experiment involving 768 college students that was conducted in Taiwan. To examine the hypothesis, a total of 256 three-person groups were assigned randomly to a task of either a high or low degree of interdependence (dealing with interdependence in operational teams). As a result, 112 high interdependence groups and 123 low interdependence groups were analyzed. Before and after the task, the participants were required to complete questionnaires to assess self-efficacy, collective efficacy, effort expenditure, and task interdependence.
Overall, at the group level of analysis, the results indicate that collective efficacy predicts the level of group effort invested and group performance. Contrary to expectations, collective efficacy has a significant effect on group effort only when subjects perform at a low level of interdependence. It also was discovered that the aggregate of individual group members' self-efficacy was not predictive of group effort in this study. Next, the perceived adequacy of group members' technical skills is a stronger determinant of collective efficacy than perceived group coordination capability regardless of the degree of task interdependence. In addition, self-efficacy is highly correlated with collective efficacy in tasks of both high and low interdependence. Finally, following Bandura (1997), collective efficacy has both individual and group level components. This study suggests that group members' perceived self-efficacy, perceived adequacy of group members' technical ability, and perceived group coordination capability all may contribute to a better determination of collective efficacy.
Limitations of the study are discussed, and possible avenues for future research as well as implications are addressed.},

  abstract = {Self-regulation at work is conceived in terms of within-person processes that occur over time. These processes are proposed to occur within a hierarchical framework of negative feedback systems that operate at different levels of abstraction and with different time cycles. Negative feedback systems respond to discrepancies in a manner that reduces deviations from standards (i.e., goals). This is in contrast to positive feedback systems in which discrepancies are created, which can lead to instability. We organize our discussion around four hierarchical levels—self, achievement task, lower-level task action, and knowledge/working memory. We theorize that these levels are loosely connected by multiple constraints and that both automatic and more conscious processes are essential to self-regulation. Within- and cross-level affective and cognitive processes interact within this system to motivate goal-related behaviors while also accessing needed knowledge and protecting current intentions from interference. Complications common in the work setting (as well as other complex, real-life settings) such as the simultaneous pursuit of multiple goals, the importance of knowledge access and expertise, and team and multiperson processes are also discussed. Finally, we highlight the usefulness of newer research methodologies and data-analytic techniques for examining such hierarchical, dynamic, within-person processes.},

  abstract = {In the workplace, employees must choose what personal information they share with others. Employees with concealable stigmas (e.g., sexual orientation, mental illness, and certain religious beliefs) face the added pressure of having to carefully manage information about a potential social liability. Yet it remains unclear how managing a concealable stigma may influence colleagues’ perceptions and reactions. Using theory about impression management and social cognition, we investigated how employees strategically manage information about their concealable stigmas and the impact of these behaviors on colleague reactions. Based on a multiple-time, multiple-source study of 196 employees, we compared 4 specific strategies for managing concealable stigmas: assimilating, decategorizing, integrating, and confirming. Consistent with our theorizing, these strategies had unique effects in how they influenced the treatment that an employee received from others. These findings have implications for research about stigmas, social cognition, and impression management, as well as for practices focused on creating diverse and supportive work environments.

In this study of 107 outside salespersons we find that more than 75\% report engaging in job crafting in various forms. Positive, significant correlations are found between episodes of work modification and the variables of self-image, perceived control, and readiness to change.},

In our setup, group members (players) with non-aligned preferences inspect alternatives or ‘‘applicants’’ one at a time with no backward solicitation. A minimal information structure is assumed where players are only informed of the relative ranks of the alternatives as they inspect them sequentially. We present the equilibrium solution, and then use it as a benchmark for our analysis. We report the results from a controlled experiment showing that subjects over-searched relative to equilibrium. Decisions were affected by theoretically irrelevant observations including the relative rank of the previous alternative and the other player’s relative rank of the current alternative. For managers engaged in committee sequential search tasks, our findings highlight the importance of being aware to reach compromises early on, among other implications.},

  abstract = {This paper develops a model of the joint impact of two factors that may influence the creation of resource advantages: the accuracy of managers’ expectations about the future value of a resource, and the severity of agency problems that cause managers’ interests to diverge from those of shareholders. While the impact of each of these factors on resource- investment decisions has been considered in isolation, their joint interaction effect has never been examined. The model generates the following set of testable hypotheses: Managers of firms with agency problems will, on average, tend to under-invest (relative to what shareholders would ideally like them to do) in resources of uncertain value. This under- investment will be most severe for those resources where managers’ information indicates a low expected value (i.e., risky bets), and will actually be reversed (i.e., over- investment) for those resources where managers’ information indicates a high expected value (i.e., safe bets). Two levers can be used to reduce the degree of this under-investment: reducing the severity of the agency problems, or improving the accuracy of managers’ expectations. Based on their interaction effect, these two levers are shown to be complementary in the sense that they work better together at reducing under-investment than either one does in isolation. Therefore, future research on the genesis of competitive advantage should examine agency and governance issues along with, not apart from, resource-based issues.},

  abstract = {Over the past few decades, there has been a surge of interest in the relationship between economic interdependence and political con›ict. One view that has gained considerable popularity and empirical support is that heightened interdependence fosters cooperative political relations. Voiced with increasing regularity in both academic and policy circles, this claim has been used to help justify the formation of the European Economic Community, Richard Nixon's opening to China, Willy Brandt's Ostpolitik, and Henry Kissinger's conception of détente with the Soviet Union. Nonetheless, critics of this argument have not been stilled. Some observers maintain that, rather than fostering cooperation, increased interdependence generates political discord. Even more widespread is the argument that economic exchange has no strong bearing on the high politics of national security. This debate is hardly new. For centuries, the nature and strength of the links between interdependence and con›ict have been the subject of heated disagreement. Until lately, however, these links remained the subject of remarkably little systematic scrutiny. In recent years, a growing number of studies have attempted to ‹ll this gap in the literature, but they have yet to resolve various crucial questions. Most important, how and to what extent does interdependence in›uence political antagonism? What are the causal mechanisms driving this relationship? And what is the most appropriate way to test this relationship? The purpose of this book is to shed new light on these key issues. In this introduction, we survey the recent literature on the effects of economic interdependence on political con›ict, placing primary emphasis on these questions and on the theoretical and empirical developments needed to answer them. Our central arguments are threefold. First, existing research has},

This learning disadvantage for risky alternatives is likely to be quite substantial and persistent, particularly among relatively fast learners. Learning to choose among alternatives whose outcomes lie in the negative domain, on the other hand, leads to favoring more risky alternatives in the short run but tends to become risk neutral in the long run. Thus, the fact that human beings exhibit greater risk aversion for gains than for losses in a wide variety of situations may reflect accumulated learning rather than inexplicable human traits or utility functions. Some implications of an experiential learning interpretation of risk preferences are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)},

In contrast, organizational district-level multi-team coordination unexpectedly exhibited a direct cross-level relationship with team performance. Multi-team coordination also negatively interacted with team processes as related to team performance, in an exploratory analysis.

  abstract = {Although the importance of organizational justice is without question, our theoretical and empirical knowledge of the justice phenomenon is focused almost exclusively on mean levels of fair treatment, ignoring whether those mean levels are achieved in a consistent or inconsistent manner. This exclusive focus on average levels of justice is not surprising given the implicit assumption in the justice literature that day-to-day variations in justice are glossed over or reinterpreted by individuals. Building upon recent research demonstrating that variability in justice can be as important as average levels of fair treatment, we leverage tenets of uncertainty management theory to provide a conceptual bridge that integrates justice variability into the group engagement model. Our theoretical model proposes justice variability (arising from fluctuations in one’s fair treatment over time) negates the very benefits that average levels of interpersonal justice provide. Results of 2, week-long experience sampling studies (one of 111 employees and one of 352 employees nested in 104 groups), used to construct assessments of day-to-day justice variability, largely supported our predictions regarding interactive effects between average levels of justice and justice variability on judgments of pride in the group and, ultimately, cooperative behavior, providing important takeaways for theory, research, and practice.

  abstract = {A large body of research demonstrates that employee perceptions of fair treatment matter. The overwhelming focus of these investigations has been on how employees react to whether or not they perceive their supervisor behaved in a fair manner. We contend, however, that employees not only question and react to whether they are treated fairly, but also to why they believe their supervisor acted fairly in the first place. To do so, we consider how employee attributions of supervisor motives for fair treatment influence the cognitive and affective mechanisms by which fair treatment influences employee reactions to fairness. Drawing from the justice actor model, we focus on both cognitive (establishing fairness, identity maintenance, and effecting compliance) and affective (positive affect) motives underlying supervisors’ fair treatment. Relying on theory and research on motive attribution and leader affect, we develop predictions for how employees’ perceptions of these motives as a result of short-term exchanges over time influence supervisor-directed citizenship behavior through both cognitive (trust in the supervisor) and affective (positive affect) mechanisms. Our experience sampling study of 613 weekly fair events (from 171 employees) largely supported our predictions, demonstrating that attribution of supervisor motives is a meaningful component of an employee’s justice experience.

A longitudinal model that includes correlations, variances, and means is described as a latent growth curve model (LGM). When merged with repeated-measures data, this technique permits the estimation of parameters representing both individual and group dynamics. The statistical basis of this model allows hypothesis testing of various developmental ideas, including models of alternative dynamic functions and models of the sources of individual differences in these functions. Aspects of these latent growth models are illustrated with a set of longitudinal WISC data from young children and by using the LISREL V computer program.]},

We discuss some contemporary forms of structural equation models (SEMs) based on the inclusion of latent variables. The specific goals of this review are to clarify basic SEM definitions, consider relations to classical models, focus on testable features of the new models, and provide recent references to more complete presentations. A broader goal is to illustrate why so many researchers are enthusiastic about the SEM approach to data analysis. We first outline some classic problems in longitudinal data analysis, consider definitions of differences and changes, and raise issues about measurement errors. We then present several classic SEMs based on the inclusion of invariant common factors and explain why these are so important. This leads to newer SEMs based on latent change scores, and we explain why these are useful.},

Cumulative culture is often explained by appeal to a combination of high-fidelity social learning and innovation, the “ratchet 10 effect.” What is often overlooked is that both human and other animal culture is supported by a more primary ratchet effect that retains and increases the prevalence of adaptive behavior. This primary ratchet can arise without appeal to specialized cognitive adaptations and is plausibly more widespread in animal societies. We use a simple model to highlight how simple forms of contingent social learning can cre15 ate the primary ratchet effect, dramatically increasing the prevalence of adaptive, hard to invent behavior. We investigate some ways that demography may interact with the primary ratchet to generate patterns of cultural variation. As the primary ratchet may be common to many animal societies, its cognitive components and population dynamics provide a common foundation for the study of animal culture and 20 a necessary foundation for understanding the origins of human cumulative culture.},

We tested this theory with data from employees in three human services organizations (N = 403). Using latent profile analyses, we identified six distinct profile groups and found that they differed on measures of need satisfaction, regulation, affect, engagement, organizational citizenship behavior, and well-being. The observed differences are consistent with the notion that a commitment profile provides a context that determines how the individual components are experienced (Gellatly, Meyer, \& Luchak, 2006). We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of this context effect.},

  abstract = {Organizational fields undergo upheavals. Shifting industry boundaries, new network forms, emerging sectors, and volatile ecosystems have become the stuff of everyday organizational life. Curiously, profound changes of this sort receive scant attention in organization theory and research. Researchers acknowledge fieldwide flux, emergence, convergence, and collapse, but sidestep direct investigations of the causes and dynamic processes, leaving these efforts to political scientists and institutional economists. This neglect is attributed to the field's philosophical, theoretical, and methodological fealty to the precepts of equilibrium and linearity. It is argued that ingrained assumptions and habituated methodologies dissuade organizational scientists from grappling with problems to which these ideas and tools do not apply. Nevertheless, equilibrium and linearity are assumptions of social theory, not facts of social life. Drawing on four empirical studies of organizational fields in flux, new intellectual perspectives and methodological heuristics are suggested that may facilitate investigation of fields that are far from equilibrium.},

Archival data from 134 firms revealed that the degree of social cohesion and type of knowledge base within a firm's top management team were related to the degree of interdependence the firm's diversification posture demanded. Contrary to our hypotheses, experience in core functional areas among top team members was positively related to corporate performance in low-interdependence firms and negatively related to it in high-interdependence firms.},

  abstract = {Performance pressure focuses employee efforts toward enhanced performance. It is unclear, however, whether performance pressure serves as a productive or unproductive strategy for producing beneficial work behavior. Our research provides clarity on the dynamic nature of performance pressure. We theorize that reactions to performance pressure are influenced by daily fluctuations in how the pressure is appraised, and these fluctuations explain why performance pressure can be a double-edged sword, producing bright and dark side effects for organizations. We predict that, on a daily basis, performance pressure may be appraised as a threat, which promotes self-regulation depletion that explains dysfunctional behavior (i.e., incivility); daily performance pressure may also be appraised as a challenge, which elicits engagement that explains enhanced task proficiency and citizenship. Trait resilience is predicted to moderate these effects, promoting performance pressure to be appraised as a challenge rather than a threat, which then mitigates the depleting effects that produce dysfunctional behavior and enhances the engaging effects that produce functional behavior. Results from an experience sampling study support our predictions. Implications for theory and research are provided.},

In the article, the fit statistics in Study 3 were reported in error. The fit of the measurement model is: Χ²(362) = 563.66, p = .001; CFI = .94; SRMR = .05; RMSEA = .04. The fit of the SEM model is: Χ²(362) = 563.66, p = .001; CFI = .94; SRMR = .05; RMSEA = .04.] Workplace cheating behavior is unethical behavior that seeks to create an unfair advantage and enhance benefits for the actor. Although cheating is clearly unwanted behavior within organizations, organizations may unknowingly increase cheating as a byproduct of their pursuit of high performance. We theorize that as organizations place a strong emphasis on high levels of performance, they may also enhance employees’ self-interested motives and need for self-protection. We suggest that demands for high performance may elicit performance pressure—the subjective experience that employees must raise their performance efforts or face significant consequences. Employees’ perception of the need to raise performance paired with the potential for negative consequences is threatening and heightens self-protection needs. Driven by self-protection, employees experience anger and heightened self-serving cognitions, which motivate cheating behavior. A multistudy approach was used to test our predictions. Study 1 developed and provided validity evidence for a measure of cheating behavior. Studies 2 and 3 tested our predictions in time-separated field studies. Results from Study 2 demonstrated that anger mediates the effects of performance pressure on cheating behavior. Study 3 replicated the Study 2 findings, and extended them to show that self-serving cognitions also mediate the effects of performance pressure on cheating behavior. Implications of our findings for theory and practice are provided. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)},

It also is shown that dynamic factor models with lagged factor loadings are not equivalent to the currently popular state-space models, and that restriction of attention to the latter type of models may yield invalid results. The known equivalent vector autoregressive model types, standard and structural, are given a new interpretation in which they are conceived of as the extremes of an innovating type of hybrid vector autoregressive models.

Interactions among agents are interpreted as collisions among molecules in gases and opinion dynamics is described according to the Boltzmann equation. Starting from a microscopic description of single interactions, global properties of the opinion distribution are derived analytically. The proposed analytic model is general enough to allow reproducing features of real societies of agents, such as positive and negative influences and bounded confidence, which are typically used to study opinion distribution models. Analytic results relative to emergent and global characteristics of considered multi-agent systems are verified by simulations obtained via direct implementation of the proposed microscopic interactions rules. Simulations confirm analytic results.},

This estimator might behave poorly in finite samples when the cross-section dimension of the data is small (i.e. small N), especially if the variables under analysis are persistent over time. This paper discusses a maximum likelihood estimator that is asymptotically equivalent to Arellano and Bond (1991) but presents better finite sample behaviour. The estimator is based on an alternative parametrization of the likelihood function introduced in Moral-Benito (2013). Moreover, it is easy to implement in Stata using the xtdpdml command as described in a companion paper published in the Stata Journal, which also discusses further advantages of the proposed estimator for practitioners.},

  abstract = {This chapter discusses the use of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) for causal inference in the observational social sciences. It focuses on DAGs’ main uses, discusses central principles, and gives applied examples. DAGs are visual representations of qualitative causal assumptions: They encode researchers’ beliefs about how the world works. Straightforward rules map these causal assumptions onto the associations and independencies in observable data. The two primary uses of DAGs are (1) determining the identifiability of causal effects from observed data and (2) deriving the testable implications of a causal model. Concepts covered in this chapter include identification, d-separation, confounding, endogenous selection, and overcontrol. Illustrative applications then demonstrate that conditioning on variables at any stage in a causal process can induce as well as remove bias, that confounding is a fundamentally causal rather than an associational concept, that conventional approaches to causal mediation analysis are often biased, and that causal inference in social networks inherently faces endogenous selection bias. The chapter discusses several graphical criteria for the identification of causal effects of single, time-point treatments (including the famous backdoor criterion), as well identification criteria for multiple, time-varying treatments.},

  abstract = {Though individual assessments are widely used in selection settings, very little research exists to support their criterion-related validity. A random-effects meta-analysis was conducted of 39 individual assessment validation studies. For the current research, individual assessments were defined as any employee selection procedure that involved (a) multiple assessment methods, (b) administered to an individual examinee, and (c) relying on assessor judgment to integrate the information into an overall evaluation of the candidate’s suitability for a job. Assessor recommendations were found to be useful predictors of job performance, although the level of validity varied considerably across studies. Validity tended to be higher for managerial than nonmanagerial occupations and for assessments that included a cognitive ability test. Validity was not moderated by the degree of standardization of the assessment content or by use of multiple assessors for each candidate. However, higher validities were found when the same assessor was used across all candidates than when different assessors evaluated different candidates. These results should be interpreted with caution, given a small number of studies for many of the moderator subgroups as well as considerable evidence of publication bias. These limitations of the available research base highlight the need for additional empirical work to inform individual assessment practices.

This model is developed based on the limbic system of the mammalian brain in order to present a desirable learning model for speech emotion recognition in dynamic situations like the brain’s emotional networks. The proposed model has four main parts including thalamus, sensory cortex, orbitofrontal cortex and amygdala. As this model is inspired from human brain, ANFIS has been used in this study to develop a model in subsystems of amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex to make rules. To classify the rate of speech emotion signals, the ANFIS outputs are given to MLP network. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has a powerful capability to identify a human’s speech emotion.},

In addition, several GLOBE value dimensions moderated the effects of CSR on AC. In particular, perceptions of CSR were more positively related to AC in cultures higher in humane orientation, institutional collectivism, ingroup collectivism, and future orientation and in cultures lower in power distance. Implications for future CSR research and cross-cultural human resources management are discussed.},

As a result, the critical question is often not “Is this test valid?”, but rather “Valid for what?”. Tests normally have multiple uses and purposes in organizations, which may be defined and understood differently by different stakeholders, and tests might have as many validities as they have uses. The strengths and weaknesses of existing validation strategies are examined and compared in the light of the ways tests are used in organizations. Content validation often seems unconnected with the ways tests are used and interpreted in organizations, and is not always useful a strategy for validating tests. Criterionoriented validation methods (including sophisiticated variants, such as the validity generalization model) are often deficient because they apply a univariate strategy for evaluating what is clearly a multivariate phenomenon—i.e., use of test scores to make high-stakes decisions in organization. Multivariate models of validation provide an opportunity to integrate qualitatively different criteria (e.g., efficiency and equity) in evaluating the validity of a test as it is used in an organization.},

The validity of a selection battery varies substantially as a function of the relative weight given to both predictors and criteria; the 95\% confidence interval for validities ranged from .20 to .78. The effective weights given to performance dimensions accounted for 34\% of the variance in selection battery validities. The model suggests that the way an organization defines job performance is a source of true and important variability in validities, and that the validity of selection tests for predicting complex performance criteria may show considerably less generalizability than current meta-analysis of univariate validities would suggest.},

However, there is little evidence that these test-to-job comparisons have any bearing on the criterion-related validity of selection tests. The authors show that conclusions reached in analyses of cognitive tests—that content matching is largely irrelevant to criterion-related validity—can be generalized to most sets of selection tests (e.g., psychomotor and performance tests, interview ratings, biodata scores, knowledge tests, work sample tests) that are positively correlated with one another and with the criterion. When the universe of potential predictors shows positive manifold, almost all possible sets of test batteries will yield similar outcomes and show similar validities, regardless of whether the content of these tests matches the content of the job.

In this article, we pose the question of whether being ethical comes at a cost to profits in customer-oriented firms. Despite the organizational reality that multiple climates coexist at a given time, research has largely ignored these types of questions, and the simultaneous analysis of multiple climate dimensions has received little empirical attention to date. Given their scientific and practical importance, this study tested complementary and conflicting perspectives regarding interactions between service (outcome-focused) and ethical (process-focused) climates on company-level financial performance. Drawing on a sample of 16,862 medical sales representatives spread across 77 subsidiary companies of a large multinational corporation in the health care product industry, we found support for a complementary view. More precisely, results revealed that profitability was enhanced, not diminished, in service-oriented firms that also stressed the importance of ethics. Results suggest studying the interactive effects of multiple climates is a more fruitful approach than examining main effects alone.},

Participants were randomly assigned to be given additional information about job-relatedness and affirmative action procedures or not (egalitarian norms), and were then told they would or would not have to explain their ratings (accountability). Consistent with aversive discrimination theory, participants rated the gay applicant less positively than the nongay applicant irrespective of self-reported and implicit heterosexist attitudes. Bias favoring the heterosexual applicant was found in the no accountability condition but no differences were seen between the gay and nongay applicant in the accountability condition. Our study did not find support of the effect of training focusing on egalitarian norms on bias in ratings. Organizations should recognize the potential bias that targets gay applicants and consider methods to incorporate accountability in order to mitigate discriminatory hiring practices.},

A meta-analysis examined the effects from 126 studies that employed OD interventions to modify satisfaction and/or other attitudes. Raju and Burkes' (1983) Taylor series approximation one validity generalization procedure was employed to conduct the meta-analysis. Multifaceted interventions were more effective in modifying satisfaction and attitudes than were OD interventions that used a single human-processes or technostructural method. For certain interventions, team building and laboratory training were the most effective means of altering satisfaction and other attitudes. Also, OD appears to affect attitudes more than satisfaction.},

  abstract = {Although narcissists often emerge as leaders, research has thus far shown inconsistent results on the relationship between leader narcissism and effectiveness in the eyes of followers. Here we draw on leader distance theory (Shamir, 1995) and implicit leader theory (Lord \& Maher, 1991) to propose that followers’ assessment of a narcissistic leader and followers’ overall job attitudes depend on the leader’s visibility to the followers. The more opportunities followers have to observe narcissistic leaders the more they will experience these leaders’ toxic behavior (e.g., exploitativeness) and the less they will perceive the leader as effective. To test our hypotheses we collected multisource, longitudinal data from 175 retail stores and obtained subjective (followers’ perceptions of leader effectiveness and their overall job attitudes) as well as objective (leaders’ organizational experience at time of hire, employee absenteeism trends) indices of leader functionality. Results showed that narcissistic leaders had less organizational experience at the time they were hired. Moreover, when followers had fewer opportunities to observe their leader, leader narcissism was positively related to perceived leadership effectiveness and job attitudes. However, when followers had more opportunity to observe their leader, the positive relationship disappeared. Finally, leader narcissism was neither positively nor negatively associated with absenteeism, whereas absenteeism declined over time under non-narcissistic leaders. These findings advance our knowledge of how followers respond to narcissistic leaders and how these leaders function in organizational settings where they have legitimate positions of power.},

To extend earlier work on the primacy of applicant pool characteristics for resolving adverse impact, they illustrate the advantages of simultaneous cognitive ability– and personality-based recruiting. Results of an algebraic recruiting model support general recruiting for cognitive ability, combined with recruiting for conscientiousness within the underrepresented group. For realistic recruiting effect sizes, this type of recruiting strategy greatly increases average performance of hires and percentage of hires from the underrepresented group. Further results from a policy-capturing study provide initial guidance on how features of organizational image can attract applicants with particular job-related personalities and abilities, in addition to attracting applicants on the basis of demographic background.

  abstract = {Engagement is widely viewed as a motivational state that captures the degree to which individuals apply their physical, cognitive, and emotional energies to their jobs, and ultimately improves job performance. However, this job-level view overlooks the possibility that engagement may vary across the different tasks within a job and that engagement in one task may influence engagement and performance in a subsequent task. In this article, we develop and test hypotheses based on a task-level view of engagement and the general notion that there is “residual engagement” from a task that carries forward to a subsequent task. We propose that although task engagement (engagement in a specific task that comprises a broader role) positively spills over to influence task engagement and performance in a subsequent task, in part because of the transmission of positive affect, task engagement simultaneously engenders attention residue, which in turn impedes subsequent task engagement and performance. These predictions were supported in a study of 477 task transitions made by 20 crew members aboard The National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s Human Exploration Research Analog (Study 1) and in a laboratory study of 346 participants who transitioned between a firefighting task and an assembly task (Study 2). Our investigation explains how engagement flows across tasks, illuminates a negative implication of engagement that has been masked by the predominant job-level perspective, and identifies completeness as a task attribute that reduces this negative consequence of engagement.},

The incidence and possible causes of change in relative performance were investigated using weekly performance data from 509 sewing machine operators. Analyses were conducted to determine the degree of performance consistency, potential moderators of consistency, and the stability of predictor-criteria relationships using multiple predictors and criteria. Results revealed a steady decline in performance stability coefficients as the interval between measures increased, regardless of the employee's prior job experience, cognitive ability, or psychomotor ability. Analyses of predictive validity revealed temporal changes in validity for both objective and subjective criteria, but not in the expected direction.},

  abstract = {Summary) Self-categorization theory proposes that people may use social characteristics such as age, race, or organizational membership to define psychological groups and to promote a positive self-identity. This theory is used to develop and test hypotheses about the effects of demographic diversity in organizations on an individual's psychological and behavioral attachment to the organization. Individual-level commitment, attendance behavior, and tenure intentions are examined as a function of the individual's degree of difference from others on such social categories as age, tenure, education, sex, and race. Analyses of a sample of 151 groups comprising 1,705 repsondents showed that increasing work-unit diversity was associated with lower levels of psychological attachment among group members. Nonsymmetrical effects were found for sex and race, with whites and men showing larger negative effects for increased unit heterogeneity than nonwhites and women.},

  abstract = {This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License. The markdown+Rknitr source code of this blog is available under a GNU General Public License (GPL v3) license from . Abstract We discuss how to choose the optimal candidate from a rankable sequence of candidates arriving one by one. The candidates could for example be job applicants, princes, tinder profiles or flats. This choice problem is casted into the context of sequential decision making and is solved using optimal stopping theory. Two R functions are provided to compute optimal selection strategies in two specific instances of the problem. Altogether, the mathematical inclined decision maker is given valuable open-source tools to support prudent real life decision making. Introduction Life is full of choices. The prudent decision maker likes to rationally balance alternatives, assess uncertain outcomes, gather additional information and - when ready - pick the best action. A mathematical approach to such decision making under uncertainty is based on maximizing an adequate utility function subject to the identified stochasticity, e.g., by maximizing expected utility. The ultimate statistical guides to such optimal decision making are the books by DeGroot (1970) and Berger (1985). Influence diagrams are compact representations of decision problems embedded within the graphical modelling toolset of Bayesian networks, see e.g. Jensen and Nielsen (2007).    In this note we consider the very simple -- but entertaining -- sequential decision problem known as the optimal choice, secretary, marriage, dowry or game of googol problem (Ferguson 1989). Scientific publishing about the optimal choice problem dates back to the 1950's and 1960's, but accounts of variations of the problem date back as far as 1613. To illustrate the problem we use the process of finding a real estate property in an overheated housing market as example. Of course, the human resource manager, wooed princess, Johannes Kepler, tinder hustler as well as the mathematical enthusiast (subsets might overlap) should easily be able to adapt terminology to their needs. The optimal choice problem The rules of the game are as follows: You want to choose exactly one property (say, buy a flat) within a given period of time The number of candidate flats available on the market and inspectable in the given time period is assumed to be known. We shall denote this number by \textbackslash{}(n\textbackslash{}). The flats are assumed to be rankable from best (rank 1) to worst (rank \textbackslash{}(n\textbackslash{})) without ties. The flats can only be inspected sequentially and in some random order. After seeing a flat one has to decide whether to pick this flat or not. Once a flat is rejected, this choice is permanent and cannot be re-called. Your objective is to find the best candidate among the \textbackslash{}(n\textbackslash{}) flats. Less will not work for you, i.e. you have no interest in the 2nd best candidate or any other worse candidate. Furthermore, the decision you have to make at each decision time is to either select the current candidate flat or reject it and inspect futher candidate flats. Which flat to pick thus at each time point is based only on the flat's relative rank within the set of flats seen up to now. Our goal is to find a strategy s.t. we end up with the best flat, i.e. rank 1, among all of the \textbackslash{}(n\textbackslash{}) flats. Note that simply looking at all candidates and then picking the best one will not work due to rules 5 and 6. Mathematical notation Following Chow et al. (1964) we introduce the following mathematical notation: Let \textbackslash{}(x\_1,\textbackslash{}ldots, x\_n\textbackslash{}) be a permutation of the integers between 1 and \textbackslash{}(n\textbackslash{}). At the time we are considering the \textbackslash{}(i\textbackslash{})'th candidate in our ordered sequence we have seen the candidates \textbackslash{}(1,\textbackslash{}ldots,i\textbackslash{}). Let \textbackslash{}(y\_i\textbackslash{}), \textbackslash{}(y\_i \textbackslash{}in \textbackslash\{1,\textbackslash{}ldots,i\textbackslash\}\textbackslash{}), denote the rank of the \textbackslash{}(i\textbackslash{})'th candidate among these \textbackslash{}(i\textbackslash{}) candidates. We call this the relative rank at time \textbackslash{}(i\textbackslash{}) of the \textbackslash{}(i\textbackslash{})'th candidate. Note that the relative rank can be 1 even though a candidates' overall rank is not 1. This is a consequence of the overall rank being only partially revealed by knowing more of the candidates. A code example illustrates the concept: \#Generate a sequence of ranks between 1 and n set.seed(123) n},

But natural selection implies competition and therefore opposes cooperation unless a specific mechanism is at work. Here I discuss five mechanisms for the evolution of cooperation: kin selection, direct reciprocity, indirect reciprocity, network reciprocity and group selection. For each mechanism, a simple rule is derived which specifies whether natural selection can lead to cooperation.},

The present study proposes an effect size index for confirmatory factor analytic (CFA) studies of measurement equivalence to address 1 of these limitations. The application of this index is illustrated with personality data from American English, Greek, and Chinese samples. Results showed a range of nonequivalence across these samples, and these differences were linked to the observed effects of DIF on the outcomes of the assessment (i.e., group-level mean differences and adverse impact).

Despite this emphasis, empirical research on the validity of congruence indices for predicting some outcomes has been somewhat disappointing (e.g. Assouline \& Meir, 1987; Tinsley, 2000). Although recent research has found that congruence indices can provide meaningful improvements in validity (Nye, Su, Rounds, \& Drasgow, 2017), it is widely recognized that these indices have a number of conceptual and methodological flaws (Camp \& Chartrand, 1992; Edwards, 1993). To help address this issue, the present work demonstrates the potential benefits of operationalizing interest congruence using polynomial regression (Edwards, 1994) and discusses how such a method can yield more nuanced details about the importance of vocational interests for predicting work and academic outcomes.},

  abstract = {Recently, there has been a growing interest in the study and use of vocational interests for predicting workplace behavior. The renewed attention to this topic is at least partially due to two recent meta-analyses (Nye, Su, Rounds, \& Drasgow, 2012; Van Iddekinge, Roth, Putka, \& Lanivich, 2011a) demonstrating the validity of interests for predicting job performance. Both studies came to the conclusion that interests predict performance but their results differed with respect to the validity of interest congruence. Although the congruence (or match) between an individual's interests and his or her work is particularly important for theories of vocational interest, there is some debate in the literature about the validity and utility of interest congruence for predicting work outcomes and the varying results reported in the two recent meta-analyses do little to resolve this issue. Therefore, the goal of the present study was to address these differences and the broader debate about interest congruence by conducting a more comprehensive meta-analysis of the validity of interest congruence for predicting job performance. An analysis of 92 studies and 1858 correlations suggested that interest congruence is a stronger predictor of performance outcomes than interest scores alone, with baseline correlations of 0.32 and 0.16, respectively. These results are discussed in the context of the broader person-environment fit literature and the implications for the interest literature and personnel selection research are discussed.},

  abstract = {Speech has been a widely used modality in the field of affective computing. Recently however, there has been a growing interest in the use of multi-modal affective computing systems. These multi-modal systems incorporate both verbal and non-verbal features for affective computing tasks. Such multi-modal affective computing systems are advantageous for emotion assessment of individuals in audio-video communication environments such as teleconferencing, healthcare, and education. From a review of the literature, the use of eye gaze features extracted from video is a modality that has remained largely unexploited for continuous affect prediction. This work presents a review of the literature within the emotion classification and continuous affect prediction sub-fields of affective computing for both speech and eye gaze modalities. Additionally, continuous affect prediction experiments using speech and eye gaze modalities are presented. A baseline system is proposed using open source software, the performance of which is assessed on a publicly available audio-visual corpus. Further system performance is assessed in a cross-corpus and cross-lingual experiment. The experimental results suggest that eye gaze is an effective supportive modality for speech when used in a bimodal continuous affect prediction system. The addition of eye gaze to speech in a simple feature fusion framework yields a prediction improvement of 6.13\% for valence and 1.62\% for arousal.},

What sparked widespread discussion after its initial introduction in 1979 is today criticized for lack of applicability. I use the debate about whistleblowing laws to show that prospect theory may be applied prescriptively in economics as a tool to design effective legislation. Whistleblowing is often seen as an important way to uncover fraud, which causes billions of USD in damages annually. I first examine the fragmented legal landscape across Europe, showing that it can be framed as one favoring rewards or the prevention of losses. I conduct an experiment with 39 university students, wherein legislative incentives are evaluated under a prospect theoretical frame in a setting of ambiguity and high stakes. Results suggest that people exhibit the typical s-shaped value function and loss aversion in line with prospect theory. In addition, their intention to whistleblow is more heavily reduced by losses than increased by gains. The study adds to the scarce literature of prospect theory on decisions in ambiguous contexts—as well as to the applicability of the theory as a prescriptive instrument in designing institutional frames. For whistleblowing in particular, a protection-based approach seems most promising.},

  abstract = {Employees may react differently to the perceived availability of motivating job characteristics during work activities, depending on the degree to which such motivating job characteristics are also present at the job level and individual differences. This study expands Job Characteristics Theory (JCT) by using a multilevel approach to predict how variations in motivating job characteristics relate to employee happiness during daily work activities. Based on adaptation level theory and the affective-reactivity hypothesis, we predicted that the positive relationship between perceived motivating job characteristics and happiness during work activities is moderated by motivating job characteristics at the job level and individual differences in trait positive affect. A sample of 68 employees filled out a general survey and reported on their job characteristics and happiness during 741 work activities using a day reconstruction method across five working days. In line with adaptation level theory, multilevel results confirmed that the perceived availability of motivating job characteristics during work activities relates positively to happiness during that same work activity, but only when similar motivating job characteristics at the job level are low. In addition, trait positive affect further moderated this cross-level interaction. In line with the affective-reactivity hypothesis, the 3-way interaction effect showed that for employees who are high in positive affect, the perceived availability of motivating job characteristics related positively to happiness during specific work activities, regardless of whether similar motivating job characteristics at the job level were high or low. We discuss how these findings add important temporal dynamics to JCT.},

The present study adds to the literature by examining a key individual difference variable in the perception of discrimination at work, namely individual color-blind attitudes. We examined relationships between 3 dimensions of color-blind attitudes (Racial Privilege, Institutional Discrimination, and Blatant Racial Issues) and perceptions of racial microaggressions in the workplace as enacted by a White supervisor toward a Black employee (i.e., discriminatory actions ranging from subtle to overt). Findings showed that observer views on institutional discrimination fully mediated, and blatant racial issues partially mediated, the relationships between racial group membership and the perception of workplace microaggressions. Non-Hispanic Whites endorsed color blindness as institutional discrimination and blatant racial issues significantly more than members of racioethnic minority groups, and higher levels of color-blind worldviews were associated with lower likelihoods of perceiving microaggressions. Views on racial privilege did not differ significantly between members of different racial groups or affect microaggression perceptions. Implications for organizations concerned about promoting more inclusive workplaces are discussed.},

Results indicate that organization-level mean emotional stability, extraversion, and conscientiousness are positively related to organization-level managerial job satisfaction and labor productivity but not to financial performance. Furthermore, organization-level mean and variance in emotional stability interact to predict all three organization-level outcomes, and organization-level mean and variance in extraversion interact to predict firm financial performance. Specifically, the positive effects of organization-level mean emotional stability and extraversion are stronger when organization-level variance in these traits is lower. Finally, organization-level mean emotional stability, extraversion, and conscientiousness are all positively related to firm financial performance indirectly via labor productivity, and the indirect effects are more positive when organization-level variance in those personality traits is lower. Overall, the findings suggest that personality-based human capital resources demonstrate tangible effects on organization-level outcomes. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed along with study limitations and future research directions.},

Cooperative interactions are required for many levels of biological organization ranging from single cells to groups of animals–. Human society is based to a large extent on mechanisms that promote cooperation–. It is well known that in unstructured populations, natural selection favors defectors over cooperators. There is much current interest, however, for studying evolutionary games in structured populations and on graphs–. These efforts recognize the fact that who-meets-whom is not random, but determined by spatial relationships or social networks–. Here we describe a surprisingly simple rule, which is a good approximation for all graphs that we have analyzed, including cycles, spatial lattices, random regular graphs, random graphs and scale-free networks,: natural selection favors cooperation, if the benefit of the altruistic act, b, divided by the cost, c, exceeds the average number of neighbors, k. Therefore, cooperation can evolve as a consequence of ‘social viscosity’ even in the absence of reputation effects or strategic complexity.},

  abstract = {Academic research on humanitarian operations (HO) is growing (Anaya-Arenas et al. 2014; Burkart et al. 2015; Duhamel et al. 2016). However, attention to and use of relevant theories in associated research is limited (Richey Jr 2009, p.619). Theories are valuable for cultivating a deeper scholarly understanding of a concept such as humanitarian operations. As such, this paper advocates increased deployment of theory in humanitarian operations research. The paper suggests and analyzes 3 social science and management theories as worthy of consideration by scholars and practitioners. The paper generates and stimulates new theory driven research ideas and outlines potential directions for future theoretically rigorous investigations of the practice of operations management in humanitarian contexts.},

Although a manipulation check involving 33 control Ss confirmed differences between the 2 experimental tasks (enriched and unenriched), results of the experiment with 42 graduate business students showed the major determinant of perceptions of task characteristics (Job Diagnostic Survey—JDS—and the Job Characteristic Inventory) and job satisfaction (JDS) to be informational influence in the form of cues about the task as either enriched or unenriched. Findings suggest that (a) job characteristics may be socially constructed as well as objective realities and that (b) perceptual measures of task dimensions may be susceptible to bias from informational cues.

We consider both a full-information problem, where the decision maker observes the exact value of each option as she searches, and a partial-information problem, in which the decision maker only learns the rank of the current option relative to the options that have already been observed. We develop a model which allows for a sharp contrast between search behavior in the two information settings, both theoretically and empirically. We present the results of an experiment that tests, and supports, the key prediction of our model analysis—limited information induces longer search. Our data further suggest systematic deviations from the theoretical benchmarks in both informational settings. Importantly, subjects in our partial-information conditions are prone to stop prematurely during early stages of the search process and to sub-optimally continue the search during late stages. We propose a simple model that succinctly captures the interplay of two symmetric choice and judgment biases that have asymmetric (but opposing) effects on the length of search.},

  abstract = {Does planning for a particular workday help employees perform better than on other days they fail to plan? We investigate this question by identifying 2 distinct types of daily work planning to explain why and when planning improves employees’ daily performance. The first type is time management planning (TMP)-creating task lists, prioritizing tasks, and determining how and when to perform them. We propose that TMP enhances employees’ performance by increasing their work engagement, but that these positive effects are weakened when employees face many interruptions in their day. The second type is contingent planning (CP) in which employees anticipate possible interruptions in their work and plan for them. We propose that CP helps employees stay engaged and perform well despite frequent interruptions. We investigate these hypotheses using a 2-week experience-sampling study. Our findings indicate that TMP’s positive effects are conditioned upon the amount of interruptions, but CP has positive effects that are not influenced by the level of interruptions. Through this study, we help inform workers of the different planning methods they can use to increase their daily motivation and performance in dynamic work environments.},

This article reviews research that adopts this motivational perspective on work design, and it emphasizes that it is important to continue to refine motivational theories. In light of continued large numbers of poor-quality jobs, attention must also be given to influencing practice and policy to promote the effective implementation of enriched work designs. Nevertheless, current and future work-based challenges mean that designing work for motivation is necessary but insufficient. This review argues that work design can be a powerful vehicle for learning and development, for maintaining and enhancing employees’ physical and mental health, and for achieving control and flexibility simultaneously (for example, in the form of ambidexterity); all these outcomes are important given the challenges in today’s workplaces. The review concludes by suggesting methodological directions.},

  abstract = {In this article we take a big picture perspective on work design research. In the first section of the paper we identify influential work design articles and use scientific mapping to identify distinct clusters of research. Pulling this material together, we identify five key work design perspectives that map onto distinct historical developments: (a) sociotechnical systems and autonomous work groups, (b) job characteristics model, (c) job demands-control model, (d) job demands-resources model, and (e) role theory. The grounding of these perspectives in the past is understandable, but we suggest that some of the distinction between clusters is convenient rather than substantive. Thus we also identify contemporary integrative perspectives on work design that build connections across the clusters and we argue that there is scope for further integration. In the second section of the paper, we review the role of Journal of Applied Psychology (JAP) in shaping work design research. We conclude that JAP has played a vital role in the advancement of this topic over the last 100 years. Nevertheless, we suspect that to continue to play a leading role in advancing the science and practice of work design, the journal might need to publish research that is broader, more contextualized, and team-oriented. In the third section, we address the impact of work design research on: applied psychology and management, disciplines beyond our own, management thinking, work practice, and national policy agendas. Finally, we draw together observations from our analysis and identify key future directions for the field.},

  abstract = {Few studies have systematically considered how individuals design work. In a replication study ( N = 211, Study 1), we showed that students naturally tend to develop simplified, low variety work. In 2 further simulation studies, we quantitatively assessed participants’ work design behaviors via 2 new measures (“enriching task allocation” and “enriching work strategy selection”). As a comparison measure, we assessed individuals’ tendency to choose individualistic rather than work design strategies (“person-focused strategy selection”). We then investigated how work design behaviors are affected by capacity (professional expertise, explicit knowledge, job autonomy) and willingness (life values). For a sample of human service professionals ( N = 218, Study 2), participants scored higher on enriching task allocation and enriching work strategy selection if they had expertise as an industrial/organizational psychologist and if they had high autonomy in their own job. Explicit knowledge about work design predicted lower scores on person-focused strategy selection, and mediated the effects of professional expertise on this outcome. Individuals high in openness values scored higher on enriching work strategy selection, and those high in conservation values scored lower on enriching task allocation. These findings were replicated in Study 3 among working professionals (N = 602). We then showed that openness to change values predicted enriching work strategy selection via the more proximal processes of valence (valuing intrinsic work characteristics) and affect (positive affect when enriching others’ work). This article opens up a new area of inquiry: how and why individuals design work for others in the way they do.

This article presents the initial step in this project, the development of a descriptive model that provides the basis for the assessment of change projects and the analysis of interactions between key success factors and performance outcomes. Forty-four survey questions were put to 117,355 employees involved in or affected by organizational change. The results of factor analyses were used to guide the development of a descriptive model of the drivers of performance in organizational change projects. This article presents the results of the factor analyses, and the ChangeTracking model that has been developed. The ChangeTracking model consists of: two outcome variables, realizing business benefits and business performance; and six key drivers, the amount of change and turbulence, available resources, alignment with the company’s vision and direction, quality of change management, work roles and emotional energy. The ChangeTracking model provides an empirically derived model of change management to guide future research and practice.},

  abstract = {A recent study of the replicability of key psychological findings is a major contribution toward understanding the human side of the scientific process. Despite the careful and nuanced analysis reported, the simple narrative disseminated by the mass, social, and scientific media was that in only 36\% of the studies were the original results replicated. In the current study, however, we showed that 77\% of the replication effect sizes reported were within a 95\% prediction interval calculated using the original effect size. Our analysis suggests two critical issues in understanding replication of psychological studies. First, researchers’ intuitive expectations for what a replication should show do not always match with statistical estimates of replication. Second, when the results of original studies are very imprecise, they create wide prediction intervals—and a broad range of replication effects that are consistent with the original estimates. This may lead to effects that replicate successfully, in that replication results are consistent with statistical expectations, but do not provide much information about the size (or existence) of the true effect. In this light, the results of the Reproducibility Project: Psychology can be viewed as statistically consistent with what one might expect when performing a large-scale replication experiment.},

The results of a joint experimental and analytic program were assimilated into a normative dynamic-decision model for predicting human task-selection performance. To this end a general multitask experimental paradigm has been developed, wherein tasks of different value, time requirement, and deadline compete for a human's attention. Via this framework, the effects of various task related variables on human-decision processes have been studied empirically. Conceptually the normative dynamic-decision model (DDM) is an outgrowth of the well-known optimal control modeling technology as applied to multitask situations. Thus the analytic framework of the DDM is rooted in modern control, estimation, and semiMarkov decision-process theories. In order to validate the model via comparison with experimental results, several time history and scalar measures of performance similarity are proposed. Excellent model-data agreement is obtained for all the experimental conditions studied.},

  abstract = {It is a well-established fact that job attitudes and organizational variables are causally related to organizational citizenship behavior (OCB), but it is unlikely that they are the only causes of this important organizational behavior. This article concerns some other possible causes of OCB. On the basis of prior research on OCB and a conceptually related phenomenon-volunteerism-we propose that two kinds of dispositional variables may play significant roles in OCB. The first of these is an individual's motives for engaging in OCB. It is argued that because OCB may serve different needs or motives for different individuals, the measurement of these motives will improve the prediction of OCB. The other dispositional variable is a personality trait-the prosocial personality orientation. Because OCB is a prosocial action and this personality trait involves prosocial thoughts, feelings, and actions, it may predict OCB better than more general personality traits. Data are presented to support the argument that both of the dispositional variables are related to OCB. Finally, it is suggested that engaging in OCB might affect a person's self-concept. Specifically, there is reason to believe it can produce changes in personal identity that are consistent with the role of an organizational citizen. Role identity and the more psychological variables mentioned earlier are integrated into a model of the causes of enduring OCB. In this model, job attitudes, organizational variables, motives, and personality traits all affect initial levels of OCB. This behavior, in turn, influences the extent to which a person develops a role identity as an organizational citizen. And it is this role identity that directly causes enduring levels of OCB. The utility of this model for predicting OCB and increasing the incidence of this behavior is discussed.},

Essential to the development of our model is the concept of organization-environment (O-E) temporal fit, which is a state of synchronization or alignment of organization and environment activity cycles. O-E temporal fit is positioned as an important contingency element because temporal misfit implies inefficiencies, substandard performance, and the potential death of the organization over time. Overall, this article offers a theoretical perspective that fills a gap in the extant organizational research literature regarding the elusive and understudied perspective of time and posits its relationship to organizational performance.},

In the first, (called the moral model because of past usage of this term), actors are held responsible for both problems and solutions and are believed to need only proper motivation. In the compensatory model, people are seen as not responsible for problems but responsible for solutions, and are believed to need power. In the medical model, individuals are seen as responsible for neither problems nor solutions and are believed to need treatment. In the enlightenment model, actors are seen as responsible for problems but as unable or unwilling to provide solutions, and are believed to need discipline. It is our general hypothesis that each set of assumptions has .characteristic consequences for the competence, status,and well-being of actors, and that the wrong choice of model in a situation will undermine effective helping and coping. Competing models of responsibility in education, psychotherapy, law, and welfare are described, and research on attribution of responsibility is recommended as a way of addressing problems of both theoretical and • social significance.},

  abstract = {This study examines team performance as a moderator of the relationship between decision influence and outcomes relevant to team effectiveness in hierarchical teams with distributed ex pertise. In this type of team staff members have unique roles and make recommendations to the team leader, who ultimately makes the team's final decisions. It is suggested that the positive rela tionship between decision influence and favorable outcomes (e.g., satisfaction) consistently described in the literature is dependent on team performance in this type of team. Specifically, team effec tiveness outcomes are proposed to be consistently more favorable in higher performing than in lower performing teams. Decision influence is proposed to relate positively to member satisfaction with the leader, willingness to return, and self-efficacy and to relate negatively to withdrawal in higher performing teams. The opposite pattern of relationships is expected in lower performing teams. A laboratory study was conducted with 228 undergradu ates performing a computer task as subordinates in 76 four-person teams with a confederate leader. The results generally support the hypotheses and illustrate a dilemma for leaders attempting to manage team effectiveness.},

On the basis of longitudinal, multi-informant and multisource data from public hospital services in England, we provide new insights into the complex interplay between employees’ perceptions of HR systems, job satisfaction, and performance outcomes over time. The dynamic panel data analyses provide support for changes in employees’ experience of an HR system being related to subsequent changes in customer satisfaction, as mediated by changes in job satisfaction, albeit these effects decrease over time. Moreover, our longitudinal analyses highlight the importance of feedback effects in the HRM–performance chain, which otherwise appears to evolve in a cyclical manner.

Understanding why some students decide to withdraw yet others persist has implications for both the well being of students as well as for institutes of higher education. The present study develops a model of the decision to withdraw drawing on theories of voluntary employee turnover from organizational psychology and signal detection theory from the cognitive sciences. The model posits that precipitating events or shocks (e.g., changes in tuition) lead students to consider withdrawing from the university. If the evidence surpasses a criterion then the student decides to withdraw. The model was used to identify shocks students were sensitive to and to test hypotheses about the underlying decision process. The theoretical implications of this model in terms of understanding and predicting student withdrawal decisions and voluntary employee turnover decisions are discussed.},

It centers this agenda within the microfoundations program, a program originating within strategy that seeks to understand firm heterogeneity and competitive advantage by examining individuals and their interrelationships. The article first reviews key theories and frameworks in strategy by taking a functionalist view, that is, by starting with a focus on organizational criteria (operational performance, organizational performance, competitive advantage). It then discusses the importance of resources and how psychology may contribute to an understanding of these resources. Organizational psychology and organizational behavior research that links to higher-level outcomes or resources is reviewed next. The article concludes with questions that we believe will fascinate scholars of organizational psychology and organizational behavior as well as with implications for practice. We hope this article helps stimulate a paradigmatic shift in organizational psychology and organizational behavior, as their theories and findings are much more strategic than is currently appreciated.},

  abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to examine how attitudes and subjective norms predict channel migration across the three channels based on the theory of reasoned action (TRA). Design/methodology/approach – A self‐administered questionnaire was administered to the participants comprised of staff, faculty, and students from four different universities in the southern and midwestern USA. The survey instrument was administered online and a total of 503 completed surveys were obtained. Findings – TRA was successful in predicting channel‐migration intention in brick‐and‐mortar stores, catalogues, and the internet. Utilitarian beliefs were more relevant in predicting attitude toward channel migration for all three channels. Normative beliefs for bricks‐and‐mortar stores and catalogues were significant in predicting subjective norms, the relationship was negative. Attitude and subjective norms were the predictors of the channel‐migration intention for all three channels. Research limitations/implications – These findings may not be generalizable to the study population because the sample was restricted to a small area. Additionally, the survey was administered online, which made it difficult to calculate the response rate. Originality/value – The paper adds insights into the subject by examining channel‐migration behaviour using TRA.},

This study employs goal interdependence theory to explore the impact of team dynamics on budgeting. How managers believe their goals are related affects the dynamics and outcomes of participation. In a large utility in Hong Kong, 64 managers were interviewed on specific budget participation incidents. Results of structural equation analyses found support for the study’s three main hypotheses. Budget team members who had cooperative goals were found to engage in more open-minded discussion in conflict situations. This resulted in improved group productivity and strengthened relationships which, in turn, led to higher-quality budgets. Results were interpreted as suggesting that the benefits of budget participation depends upon establishing strongly cooperative goals among team members and developing the skills to discuss opposing views open-mindedly. The antecedents of goal interdependence are also explored.},

However, when there are many levels of nesting, these models can become difficult to estimate. We introduce a novel evaluation strategy, Rampart, that applies an orthogonal rotation to the parts of a model that conform to commonly met requirements. This rotation dramatically simplifies fit evaluation in a way that becomes more potent as the size of the data set increases. We validate and evaluate the implementation using a 3-level latent regression simulation study. Then we analyze data from a statewide child behavioral health measure administered by the Oklahoma Department of Human Services. We demonstrate the efficiency of Rampart compared to other similar software using a latent factor model with a 5-level decomposition of latent variance. Rampart is implemented in OpenMx, a free and open source software package.},

Using multilevel modeling and a population health perspective, we tested a model linking nationally representative individual-level data (N = 100,968) on exposure to economic stressors and county-level population health determinants (N = 3,026) to responses on a composite measure of individual well-being that included the facets of purpose, community, physical, and social well-being, as well as life satisfaction. Results indicate that higher income- and employment-related economic stress were significantly related to poorer well-being. Additionally, living in a county with more positive population health determinants was significantly predictive of individual well-being. Finally, the Level-1 relationship between income-related stress and well-being was significantly attenuated for individuals living in counties with more positive population health determinants. In contrast, employment-related stress had a stronger negative relationship with well-being for individuals who lived in counties with more positive population health determinants. We discuss these findings in light of conservation of resources and relative deprivation theories, as well as how they may extend the scientific foundation for evidence-based social policy and evidence-based intervention programs aimed at lessening the effects of economic stress on individual well-being.},

  abstract = {Social media utilities have made it easier than ever to know about the range of online or offline social activities one could be engaging. On the upside, these social resources provide a multitude of opportunities for interaction; on the downside, they often broadcast more options than can be pursued, given practical restrictions and limited time. This dual nature of social media has driven popular interest in the concept of Fear of Missing Out – popularly referred to as FoMO. Defined as a pervasive apprehension that others might be having rewarding experiences from which one is absent, FoMO is characterized by the desire to stay continually connected with what others are doing. The present research presents three studies conducted to advance an empirically based understanding of the fear of missing out phenomenon. The first study collected a diverse international sample of participants in order to create a robust individual differences measure of FoMO, the Fear of Missing Out scale (FoMOs); this study is the first to operationalize the construct. Study 2 recruited a nationally representative cohort to investigate how demographic, motivational and well-being factors relate to FoMO. Study 3 examined the behavioral and emotional correlates of fear of missing out in a sample of young adults. Implications of the FoMOs measure and for the future study of FoMO are discussed.},

Over the past few decades, there have been substantial advances in predictive modeling methods and concepts from the computer science, machine learning, and statistics literatures that may have potential value for organizational science and practice. Nevertheless, treatment of these modern methods in major management and industrial-organizational psychology journals remains minimal. The purpose of this article is to (a) raise awareness among organizational researchers and practitioners with regard to several modern prediction methods and concepts, (b) discuss in nonmathematical terms how they compare to traditional regression-based prediction methods, and (c) provide an empirical example of their application and performance relative to traditional methods. Beyond illustrating their potential for improving prediction, we will also illustrate how these methods can offer deeper insights into how predictor content functions beyond simple construct-based explanations.},

  abstract = {The public goods game is the classic laboratory paradigm for studying collective action problems. Each participant chooses how much to contribute to a common pool which returns benefits to all participants equally. The ideal outcome is if everybody contributes the maximum amount, but the self-interested strategy is not to contribute anything. Most previous studies have found punishment to be more effective than reward for maintaining cooperation in public goods games. The typical design of these studies, however, represses future consequences for today’s actions. In an experimental setting, we compare public goods games followed by punishment, reward or both in the setting of truly repeated games, where player identities persist from round to round. We show that reward is as effective as punishment for maintaining public cooperation and leads to higher total earnings. Moreover, when both options are available, reward leads to increased contributions and payoff, while punishment has no effect on contributions and leads to lower payoff. We conclude that reward outperforms punishment in repeated public goods games and that human cooperation in such repeated settings is best supported by positive interactions with others.},

  abstract = {Alexithymia as a disorder of affect regulation entails a patient’s reduced ability to process emotional information. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of alexithymia [as measured by the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS)-26, German version] on affective correlates in a dyadic therapeutic interaction (as recorded by the Emotional Facial Action Coding System). Interviews with 12 in-patients with various psychosomatic disorders (anxiety, depression, somatisation) were videotaped and evaluated for facial affect display. The corresponding emotional reactions of the therapists (split screen) were recorded separately. Patients with high alexithymia scores (TAS-26 total score) tended to display less aggressive affects than those with low scores. The therapists’ predominant emotional reaction to alexithymic patients was contempt. Our findings underscore the deep-rooted nature of alexithymia as a disorder of affect regulation. Since facial affects play a major role in the regulation of emotional interaction, this disorder may evoke negative reactions of potential caregivers.},

Each of the models was augmented with assumptions of variability across trials in the rate of accumulation of evidence from stimuli, the values of response criteria, and the value of base RT across trials. Although there was substantial model mimicry, empirical conditions were identified under which the models make discriminably different predictions. The best accounts of the data were provided by the Wiener diffusion model, the OU model with small-to-moderate decay, and the accumulator model with long-tailed (exponential) distributions of criteria, although the last was unable to produce error RTs shorter than correct RTs. The relationship between these models and 3 recent, neurally inspired models was also examined. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)},

Results indicate that supervisor support, interactional justice, recognition, and group cohesion all significantly contributed to greater volunteer satisfaction and ongoing commitment to the agency. Findings are discussed in the light of social exchange theory, highlighting the need for adequate supervisor training, enhanced volunteer recognition schemes, and attention to interpersonal climate within agency units.},

  abstract = {In this paper I consider the proximate cues underlying context-associated variation in the agonistic behaviour of the spider Agelenopsis aperta (Gertsch). At the initiation of a contest, individual opponents are shown to assess their relative weights; the subsequent behaviour of each is adjusted according to the result of the assessments. Escalation to potentially injurious behaviour early in the contest, for instance, is a threshold effect of weight bias. Several lines of evidence indicate that only the territory Owner (resident) has information about the quality of a site at the initiation of a territorial dispute. (1) Owners of poor-quality sites that received food supplements exhibited significantly greater persistence and estimated energy expenditure in contests over these sites than unsupplemented individuals did over theirs. (2) A significant correlation was observed between web area and the behaviour of Owners, but not between web area and the behaviour of Intruders (individuals that encroach on occupied webs). (3) No correspondence was observed between spider body temperature and agonistic behaviour. (4)The presence or absence of prey on the web during the dispute did not affect the agonistic behaviour of either opponent. I conclude that the Intruder's behaviour is in some way adjusted to that of the Owner rather than directly to some aspect of the disputed site. Partial correlation analyses show site quality to have a greater influence on agonistic behaviour than weight bias, although both are important determinants of spider behaviour in territorial disputes.},

To answer this perennial question, the author conducted meta-analytic regression analyses on 16 studies that had repeatedly measured performance and job attitudes (i.e., job satisfaction or organizational commitment). The effect of job attitudes on subsequent performance, with baseline performance controlled, was weak but statistically significant (␤ ϭ .06). The effect was slightly stronger for commitment than for satisfaction and depended negatively on time lag. Effects of performance on subsequent job attitudes were elusive (␤ ϭ .00 across all studies), which suggests that job attitudes are more likely to influence performance than vice versa.},

It proposes a radical temporalist approach to the study of OB which combines a new way of conceptualizing and formulating research questions with an alternative methodology for empirical research. Abandoning the static notion of ‘variable’ the focus is placed on inherently dynamic ‘temporal phenomena’. On the basis of a generic model which assumes phenomena to be temporally bounded, an analytical scheme is proposed which relates the onset, duration and dynamics of phenomenon A to those of phenomenon B. In this way, nine prototypical problem types are defined, all of which center around time. A research strategy is proposed which involves three major steps, i.e. (1) temporal modeling of OB phenomena, (2) the investigation of temporal relationships, and (3) the assessment of constancy and variety over longer time periods. After discussing some general methodological issues (related to time scale, time frame, time grid, observation/recording, and measurement) a number of methods for performing these three types of research are reviewed. They include: descriptive modeling, random coefficient modeling, latent growth modeling, event history analysis, time series analysis, analysis of variance, and multiple regression analysis. Finally, limitations of the radical temporalist approach and future challenges are discussed.},

  abstract = {Correlation does not imply causation; but often, observational data are the only option, even though the research question at hand involves causality. This article discusses causal inference based on observational data, introducing readers to graphical causal models that can provide a powerful tool for thinking more clearly about the interrelations between variables. Topics covered include the rationale behind the statistical control of third variables, common procedures for statistical control, and what can go wrong during their implementation. Certain types of third variables—colliders and mediators—should not be controlled for because that can actually move the estimate of an association away from the value of the causal effect of interest. More subtle variations of such harmful control include using unrepresentative samples, which can undermine the validity of causal conclusions, and statistically controlling for mediators. Drawing valid causal inferences on the basis of observational data is not a mechanistic procedure but rather always depends on assumptions that require domain knowledge and that can be more or less plausible. However, this caveat holds not only for research based on observational data, but for all empirical research endeavors.},

  abstract = {Over the past 30 years, the nature of communication at work has changed. Leaders in particular rely increasingly on e-mail to communicate with their superiors and subordinates. However, researchers and practitioners alike suggest that people frequently report feeling overloaded by the e-mail demands they experience at work. In the current study, we develop a self-regulatory framework that articulates how leaders' day-to-day e-mail demands relate to a perceived lack of goal progress, which has a negative impact on their subsequent enactment of routine (i.e., initiating structure) and exemplary (i.e., transformational) leadership behaviors. We further theorize how two cross-level moderators-centrality of e-mail to one's job and trait self-control-impact these relations. In an experience sampling study of 48 managers across 10 consecutive workdays, our results illustrate that e-mail demands are associated with a lack of perceived goal progress, to which leaders respond by reducing their initiating structure and transformational behaviors. The relation of e-mail demands with leader goal progress was strongest when e-mail was perceived as less central to performing one's job, and the relations of low goal progress with leadership behaviors were strongest for leaders low in trait self-control.},

This study also considers whether job characteristics are potential mediators in these relationships. Once a month for four months, the 271 employees completed identical forms of a questionnaire in which they describe their jobs, their positions within their organizations, their values, and their responses to work. Company records yielded monthly absenteeism data. Measures of department structure and technology were derived from company records and interviews. Results indicate that departmental characteristics, positional characteristics, and individual characteristics predict attitudes and behavior, with individual characteristics being the best predictor. By themselves, job characteristics are related most highly to departmental characteristics. Job characteristics associated with organizational position account entirely for the relation of positional characteristics (such as shift) to attitudes and behavior. Job characteristics also account for a substantial part of the relationship of departmental characteristics to attitudes and behavior, but do not explain the relation of individual characteristics to these responses. Finally, this study discusses the need to assess individual perceptions as well as objective characteristics of contexts.},

When using multiple predictors in a selection system, guidance as to whether differential prediction analysis should be conducted on each predictor individually, or on the set of predictors in combination, is lacking. Analyzing predictors individually creates the possibility of an omitted variable problem. Army Project A data were used to examine differential prediction by race wit the use of personality measures for 79 predictor-criterion combinations. Traditional analysis indicated predictive bias by intercept in 45 instances and by slope in 7 instances; the inclusion of an Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery general factor as an additional predictor changed the conclusion in 32 cases for the intercept and in 3 cases for the slope.

  abstract = {Many animal social structures are organized hierarchically, with dominant individuals monopolizing resources. Dominance hierarchies have received great attention from behavioural and evolutionary ecologists. As a result, there are many methods for inferring hierarchies from social interactions. Yet, there are no clear guidelines about how many observed dominance interactions (i.e. sampling effort) are necessary for inferring reliable dominance hierarchies, nor are there any established tools for quantifying their uncertainty. In this study, we simulated interactions (winners and losers) in scenarios of varying steepness (the probability that a dominant defeats a subordinate based on their difference in rank). Using these data, we (1) quantify how the number of interactions recorded and hierarchy steepness affect the performance of three methods, (2) propose an amendment that improves the performance of a popular method, and (3) suggest two easy procedures to measure uncertainty in the inferred hierarchy. First, we found that the ratio of interactions to individuals required to infer reliable hierarchies is surprisingly low, but depends on the hierarchy steepness and method used. We then show that David's score and our novel randomized Elo-rating are the two best methods, whereas the original Elo-rating and the recently described ADAGIO perform less well. Finally, we propose two simple methods to estimate uncertainty at the individual and group level. These uncertainty measures further allow to differentiate non-existent, very flat and highly uncertain hierarchies from intermediate, steep and certain hierarchies. Overall, we find that the methods for inferring dominance hierarchies are relatively robust, even when the ratio of observed interactions to individuals is as low as 10 to 20. However, we suggest that implementing simple procedures for estimating uncertainty will benefit researchers, and quantifying the shape of the dominance hierarchies will provide new insights into the study organisms.},

For long and complex projects, process-based rewards have a negative effect and outcome-based rewards have a positive effect on performance. For risky projects and highly competitive or relatively stable industries, a nonlinear and monotonically decreasing relationship exists between outcome-based rewards and product quality.},

From a study of employees’ experiences across 6 weekly repeated measurements, we found that within-person increases in experienced dirtiness were positively related to their withdrawal behaviors and job change propensity indirectly through occupational disidentification. Assessed at the between-subjects level, team-oriented leadership moderated the indirect within-person effects of work dirtiness experiences on these outcomes. The relationships between elevations in experienced work dirtiness and occupational disidentification were more strongly positive at lower levels of team-oriented leadership. Analyses also showed that individuals’ perceptions of occupational stigma independently moderated the within-person relationship between experienced dirtiness and occupational disidentification. We discuss theoretical implications for the literature on dirty work and practical implications for mitigating the adverse outcomes associated with experienced work dirtiness.},

As hypothesized, results of structural equation modeling analyses revealed that: (1) increases in job demands (i.e., overload, emotional demands, and work-home interference) and decreases in job resources (i.e., social support, autonomy, opportunities to learn, and feedback) predict burnout, (2) increases in job resources predict work engagement, and (3) burnout (positively) and engagement (negatively) predict registered sickness duration (“involuntary” absence) and frequency (“involuntary” absence), respectively. Finally, consistent with predictions results suggest a positive gain spiral: initial work engagement predicts an increase in job resources, which, in its turn, further increases work engagement.

  abstract = {Integrating attitude theory with the job attitudes literature, we position job attitude strength (JAS) as a missing yet important theoretical concept in the study of job attitudes. We examine JAS as a moderator of the relationship between job satisfaction and several criteria of interest to organizational scholars (job performance, organizational citizenship behavior, withdrawal). We also examine multiple relevant indicators of JAS (i.e., attitude certainty, attitude extremity, latitude of rejection, and structural consistency), both to shed light on its conceptual nature and to provide meaningful practical direction to researchers interested in incorporating JAS into job attitude research. Data were collected in five field samples (total N ϭ 816). Results support our hypotheses: JAS moderates the relationships between job satisfaction and performance, organizational citizenship behavior, and turnover intentions; in each case, these relationships are significantly stronger for employees with stronger job satisfaction attitudes. However, as expected, not all JAS indicators are equally effective as moderators. We discuss our findings in terms of their theoretical, empirical, and practical implications for the future study of job attitudes.},

Drawing on 8 years of employee and customer survey data from a financial services firm, we used a recently developed empirical technique-covariate balanced propensity score (CBPS) weighting-to examine if the proposed relationships between HPWS and satisfaction outcomes can be explained by reverse causality, selection effects, or commonly omitted variables such as leadership behavior. The results provide support for leader behaviors as a primary driver of customer satisfaction, rather than HPWS, and also suggest that the problem of reverse causality requires additional attention in future human resource (HR) systems research. Model comparisons suggest that the estimates and conclusions vary across CBPS, meta-analytic, cross-sectional, and time-lagged models (with and without a lagged dependent variable as a control). We highlight the theoretical and methodological implications of the findings for HR systems research.},

            ,” uppermost. Surprisingly, it is unknown whether this body of evidence is informative about how cognition is structured within individuals. Using data from 101 young adults performing nine cognitive tasks on 100 occasions distributed over six months, we find that the structures of individuals’ cognitive abilities vary among each other, and deviate greatly from the modal between-person structure. Working memory contributes the largest share of common variance to both between- and within-person structures, but the
            
            factor is much less prominent within than between persons. We conclude that between-person structures of cognitive abilities cannot serve as a surrogate for within-person structures.

  abstract = {With a newly developed computer analysis the space coordinates of light-reflecting points, attached to a subjects' face, were recorded across time with high temporal and spatial resolution. Under different experimental conditions the facial actions of 20 schizophrenics, 20 depressives and 20 normal controls were analysed. Furthermore, raters watched the synchronously recorded video versions of the subject's face and rated them as to expressivity. The findings indicate that depressive and schizophrenic patients exhibited reduced facial activity in the upper part of their face in social interaction conditions. Schizophrenic patients showed reduced facial action responsivitiy across different conditions and emotions. All patients were judged to be less expressive than normal controls by raters, suggesting apparent disintegrated elements in facial activity, although when computer-analysed they exhibited the same amount of facial activity.},

Observed search behavior is more consistent with a new model that assumes dynamic updating of utility reference points than with models that are based on expected-utility maximization. Specifically, reference point updating and loss aversion play a role for more than a third of the population. The findings are of practical relevance as well as of interest for researchers who incorporate behavioral heterogeneity into models of dynamic choice behavior in, for example, consumer economics, labor economics, finance, and decision theory.},

The refined theory more accurately expresses the central assumption of the original theory that research has largely ignored: Values form a circular motivational continuum. The theory defines and orders 19 values on the continuum based on their compatible and conflicting motivations, expression of self-protection versus growth, and personal versus social focus. We assess the theory with a new instrument in 15 samples from 10 countries (N ϭ 6,059). Confirmatory factor and multidimensional scaling analyses support discrimination of the 19 values, confirming the refined theory. Multidimensional scaling analyses largely support the predicted motivational order of the values. Analyses of predictive validity demonstrate that the refined values theory provides greater and more precise insight into the value underpinnings of beliefs. Each value correlates uniquely with external variables.},

  abstract = {Although goal pursuit is related to both functioning of the brain’s reward circuits and psychological factors, the literatures surrounding these concepts have often been separate. Here, we use the psychological construct of regulatory focus to investigate individual differences in neural response to reward. Regulatory focus theory proposes two motivational orientations for personal goal pursuit: (1) promotion, associated with sensitivity to potential gain, and (2) prevention, associated with sensitivity to potential loss. The monetary incentive delay task was used to manipulate reward circuit function, along with instructional framing corresponding to promotion and prevention in a within-subject design. We observed that the more promotion oriented an individual was, the lower their ventral striatum response to gain cues. Follow-up analyses revealed that greater promotion orientation was associated with decreased ventral striatum response even to no-value cues, suggesting that promotion orientation may be associated with relatively hypoactive reward system function. The findings are also likely to represent an interaction between the cognitive and motivational characteristics of the promotion system with the task demands. Prevention orientation did not correlate with ventral striatum response to gain cues, supporting the discriminant validity of regulatory focus theory. The results highlight a dynamic association between individual differences in self-regulation and reward system function.},

  abstract = {Drawing on career self-management frameworks as well as image theory and the unfolding model of turnover, we developed a model predicting early career employees’ decisions to pursue graduate education. Using a sample of 337 alumni from 2 universities, we found that early career individuals with intrinsic career goals, who engaged in career planning, who were less satisfied with their career, or who experienced impactful positive career shocks were more likely to intend to go to graduate school. In contrast, individuals with extrinsic career goals who were highly satisfied with their careers were less likely to intend to go to graduate school. Graduate education intentions, career planning, and the impact of having one’s mentor leave the organization positively related to actual applications to graduate school. However, having extrinsic career goals, an impactful sooner than expected raise or promotion (a positive career shock), and a negative organizational change (a negative career shock) negatively related to the likelihood of applying. The career shocks’ direct relationship to applications to graduate school, regardless of one’s intentions, suggests that “the best laid plans” can sometimes be altered by unplanned events. This study contributes to the literatures on career self-management and graduate education and extends the application of the shock construct from the unfolding model of turnover to other careerrelated decisions.},

However, there has been little work on the correspondence between the latent growth curve model (LGM) and the latent change score model (see Grimm, Zhang, Hamagami, \& Mazzocco, 2013). We demonstrate that four popular variants of the latent change score model – the no change, constant change, proportional change, and dual change models – have LGM equivalents. We provide equations that allow the translation of parameters from one approach to the other and vice versa. We then illustrate this equivalence using mathematics achievement data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth.},

How people maintain unrealistic optimism, despite frequently encountering information that challenges those biased beliefs, is unknown. Here, we provide an explanation. Specifically, we show a striking asymmetry, whereby people updated their beliefs more in response to information that was better than expected compared to information that was worse. This selectivity was mediated by a relative failure to code for errors that should reduce optimism. Distinct regions of the prefrontal cortex tracked estimation errors when those called for positive update, both in highly optimistic and low optimistic individuals. However, highly optimistic individuals exhibited reduced tracking of estimation errors that called for negative update within right inferior prefrontal gyrus. These findings show that optimism is tied to a selective update failure, and diminished neural coding, of undesirable information regarding the future.},

We introduce two classes of identity management strategies individuals use to mitigate the negative consequences of discrimination: identity switching (i.e., deemphasizing target identities and recategorizing to a more positively valued identity) and identity redefinition (i.e., stereotype reassociation and regeneration). Organizations adopting a color-blind approach may make it more difficult for individuals to use identity switching because the policies deemphasize differences in social identities. In contrast, organizations adopting a multicultural approach may make it more difficult for individuals to use identity redefinition. Multicultural approaches, applied superficially, may celebrate group differences that might actually reinforce culturally dominant stereotypes. We explore the likelihood that individuals will adopt each strategy given these organizational approaches to diversity. We outline steps organizations can take to reduce the need for identity management strategies and to facilitate identity management when necessary.},

  abstract = {Decision-makers with ideal candidates already in mind often extend search beyond optimal endpoints when searching for the best option among a sequential list of alternatives. Extended search is investigated here using three laboratory experiments; individuals in these tasks exhibit future-bias, delaying choice beyond normative benchmarks. Searchers’ behavior is consistent with setting high thresholds based on a focal ideal outcome without full attention to its probability or the value of second-best alternatives; the behavior is partially debiased by manipulating which outcomes are in the searchers’ focal set. Documenting future-bias in sequential search tasks offers new insights for understanding self-control and intertemporal choice by providing a situation in which thresholds may be set too high and myopic behavior does not prevail.

  abstract = {Cooperation has long been an enigma in the life and social sciences. A possible explanation for the phenomenon is the recently developed idea of strong reciprocity in which agents altruistically reward those that cooperate and altruistically punish those that do not. The acts are altruistic in the sense that when agents punish or reward they incur a cost but receive no material benefit. Both experimentalists and modelers have focused primarily on third-party altruistic punishment mechanisms yet rarely discuss how they establish a cost for punishing. In this study I used agentbased modelling to test the ability of altruistic punishment to elicit fair allocations in a simulated ultimatum game. In particular I simulated agents with the ability to punish neighbors whose offers were deemed too low while systematically varying the ratio of costs between punisher and punishee. Despite several studies in which strong reciprocity is shown to induce cooperation, altruistic punishment failed to evolve fair allocations in these simulations. However, outcomes were highly dependant on the spatial structure of agents in the simulations and fair allocations did evolve in a linearly structured population even in the absence of punishment. As the number of immediate neighbors increased, mean offers fell but still remained significantly greater than that predicted by standard economic theory. Only when social structure was removed, and agents could interact with any other agent in the population, did offers in the simulated ultimatum game match theoretical expectations.},

A multimodal setup was arranged for synchronized recording of face videos, audio signals, eye gaze data, and peripheral/central nervous system physiological signals. Twenty-seven participants from both genders and different cultural backgrounds participated in two experiments. In the first experiment, they watched 20 emotional videos and self-reported their felt emotions using arousal, valence, dominance, and predictability as well as emotional keywords. In the second experiment, short videos and images were shown once without any tag and then with correct or incorrect tags. Agreement or disagreement with the displayed tags was assessed by the participants. The recorded videos and bodily responses were segmented and stored in a database. The database is made available to the academic community via a web-based system. The collected data were analyzed and single modality and modality fusion results for both emotion recognition and implicit tagging experiments are reported. These results show the potential uses of the recorded modalities and the significance of the emotion elicitation protocol.},

  abstract = {Automatic emotion recognition from speech has received an increasing amount of interest in recent years, and many speech emotion recognition methods have been presented, in which the training and testing procedures are often conducted on the same corpus. However, in practice, the training and testing speech utterances are collected from different conditions or devices, which will have adverse effects on recognition performance. To address this problem, in this paper, a novel cross-corpus speech emotion recognition method, called transfer non-negative matrix factorization (TNMF) is proposed. Specifically, the NMF approach, which is popular in computer vision and pattern recognition fields, is utilized to obtain low dimensional representations of emotional features. Meanwhile, the discrepancies between source and target data sets are considered, and the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) algorithm is used for similarity measurement. Then, the TNMF method, which jointly optimizes the NMF and MMD algorithms, is presented. Moreover, to further improve the recognition performance, two variants of TNMF, called transfer graph regularized NMF (TGNMF) and transfer constrained NMF (TCNMF), are proposed, respectively. Several experiments are carried out on three popular emotional databases, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our scheme.},

  abstract = {To reduce adverse impact potential and improve diversity outcomes from personnel selection, one promising technique is De Corte, Lievens, and Sackett’s (2007) Pareto-optimal weighting strategy. De Corte et al.’s strategy has been demonstrated on (a) a composite of cognitive and noncognitive (e.g., personality) tests (De Corte, Lievens, \& Sackett, 2008) and (b) a composite of specific cognitive ability subtests (Wee, Newman, \& Joseph, 2014). Both studies illustrated how Pareto-weighting (in contrast to unit weighting) could lead to substantial improvement in diversity outcomes (i.e., diversity improvement), sometimes more than doubling the number of job offers for minority applicants. The current work addresses a key limitation of the technique—the possibility of shrinkage, especially diversity shrinkage, in the Pareto-optimal solutions. Using Monte Carlo simulations, sample size and predictor combinations were varied and cross-validated Pareto-optimal solutions were obtained. Although diversity shrinkage was sizable for a composite of cognitive and noncognitive predictors when sample size was at or below 500, diversity shrinkage was typically negligible for a composite of specific cognitive subtest predictors when sample size was at least 100. Diversity shrinkage was larger when the Pareto-optimal solution suggested substantial diversity improvement. When sample size was at least 100, cross-validated Pareto-optimal weights typically outperformed unit weights—suggesting that diversity improvement is often possible, despite diversity shrinkage. Implications for Pareto-optimal weighting, adverse impact, sample size of validation studies, and optimizing the diversity-job performance tradeoff are discussed.},

We hypothesized that job stressors (situational constraints, job demands) moderate these relations. A diary study over 1 workweek with 2 measurement occasions per day (N ϭ 111 persons) provided support for most of the hypotheses: Morning recovery level predicted work engagement, and work engagement predicted subsequent recovery level at the end of the workday after controlling for morning recovery level. As predicted, situational constraints attenuated these relations, but job demands did not. The results suggest that recovery translates into employee work engagement, and work engagement, in turn, prevents a loss in recovery level throughout the day, particularly when situational constraints are low. Situational constraints seem to interrupt the reciprocal processes between recovery level and work engagement.},

Current day crises regarding replicability in science intertwines with the question of how statistical methods link data to statistical and substantive theories and models. Different answers to this question have important methodological consequences for inference, which are intertwined with a contrast between the ontological commitments of the two types of models. The key to untangling them is the realization that behind every substantive model there is a statistical model that pertains exclusively to the probabilistic assumptions imposed on the data. It is not that the methodology determines whether to be a realist about entities and processes in a substantive field. It is rather that the substantive and statistical models refer to different entities and processes, and therefore call for different criteria of adequacy.},

  abstract = {The cross-sectional research design, especially when used with self-report surveys, is held in low esteem despite its widespread use. It is generally accepted that the longitudinal design offers considerable advantages and should be preferred due to its ability to shed light on causal connections. In this paper, I will argue that the ability of the longitudinal design to reflect causality has been overstated and that it offers limited advantages over the cross-sectional design in most cases in which it is used. The nature of causal inference from a philosophy of science perspective is used to illustrate how cross-sectional designs can provide evidence for relationships among variables and can be used to rule out many potential alternative explanations for those relationships. Strategies for optimizing the use of cross-sectional designs are noted, including the inclusion of control variables to rule out spurious relationships, the addition of alternative sources of data, and the incorporation of experimental methods. Best practice advice is offered for the use of both cross-sectional and longitudinal designs, as well as for authors writing and for reviewers evaluating papers that report results of cross-sectional studies.},

Accordingly, we know much about who engages in OCB, in general, but know relatively little regarding under what circumstances people engage in OCB. By integrating social comparison with affective events and just-world theories, we propose and test a dynamic model wherein directional social comparisons are expected to have direct (automatic-motivational) and indirect (affective) intraindividual effects on OCB. The hypotheses were tested using multilevel modeling on 1076 observations from 99 participants that were collected via an interval-contingent experience sampling methodology. The results provide support for the hypotheses that social comparisons are related to OCB through positive affect and the direct effects of social comparisons on OCB are moderated by beliefs in a just world. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed. Copyright © 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Higgins' (2000) theory of regulatory fit proposes that motivational strength will be enhanced when the manner in which people work toward a goal sustains (rather than disrupts) their regulatory orientation. This enhanced motivational strength in turn should improve efforts at goal attainment. In Experiment 1, predominantly promotion- and prevention-focused participants were given the goal of writing a report on their leisure time, and were assigned either eagerness- or vigilance-framed means to use. Promotion/eagerness and prevention/vigilance participants were about 50\% more likely to turn in their reports than promotion/vigilance and prevention/eagerness participants. In Experiment 2, participants read either a promotion- or a prevention-framed health message urging them to eat more fruits and vegetables, and were then asked to imagine either the benefits of compliance or the costs of non-compliance. Promotion/benefits and prevention/costs participants subsequently ate about 20\% more fruits and vegetables over the following week than promotion/costs and prevention/benefits participants. The implications of regulatory fit's enhancement of motivational strength are discussed. Copyright © 2004 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Flexible working time arrangements are becoming increasingly popular around the globe, but do they actually benefit employees? To address this question, we take a differentiated look at employees’ day-specific use of flextime and its effect on the intersection of work and nonwork life. Specifically, we examined whether links between day-specific flextime use and affective well-being at work and at home can be explained by level of goal completion and the subjective boundaries around one’s work and private life domains (i.e., the strength of work–nonwork boundaries). During 2 consecutive workweeks, 150 bank employees from various functions (Study 1) and a heterogeneous sample of 608 employees (Study 2) reported their day-specific use of flextime, boundary strength at work and home, and affective well-being in the evening and the next day. Multilevel structural equation modeling of 2,223 (Study 1) and 3,164 (Study 2) observations revealed that flextime use was associated with stronger boundaries at home in both studies and stronger boundaries at work in Study 2. Stronger boundaries were, in turn, positively associated with affective well-being, both in the same evening and the next day. Study 2 further revealed that day-specific nonwork goal completion mediated the positive association between daily flextime use and boundary strength at work. However, whereas occasional flextime use had unequivocal positive consequences, chronic flextime use undermined the completion of work goals. Overall, findings suggest that flextime use benefits employees when used in moderation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)},

  abstract = {This article reviews recent empirical research on collective choice and collaborative problem solving. Much of the collective choice research focuses on hidden profiles. A hidden profile exists when group members individually have information favoring suboptimal choices but the group collectively has information favoring an optimal choice. Groups are notoriously bad at discovering optimal choices when information is distributed to create a hidden profile. Reviewed work identifies informational structures, individual processing biases, and social motivations that inhibit and facilitate the discovery of hidden profiles. The review of collaborative problem-solving research is framed by Larson's concept of synergy. Synergy refers to performance gains that are attributable to collaboration. Recent research has addressed factors that result in groups performing as well as their best member (weak synergy) and better than their best member (strong synergy). Communication dynamics underlying both collective choice and collaborative problem solving are discussed. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Psychology, Volume 71 is January 4, 2020. Please see http://www.annualreviews.org/page/journal/pubdates for revised estimates.},

Our prescription for a Post-p {$<$} 0.05 Era is to develop and teach courses that expand our view of what constitutes the domain of statistics and thereby bridge undergraduate statistics coursework and the graduate student experience of applying statistics in research. Such courses can speed up the process of gaining statistical wisdom by giving students insight into the human propensity to make statistical errors, the meaning of a single test within a research project, ways in which p-values work and don’t work as expected, the role of statistics in the lifecycle of science, and best practices for statistical communication. The course we have developed follows the story of how we use data to understand the world, leveraging simulation-based approaches to perform customized analyses and evaluate the behavior of statistical procedures. We provide ideas for expanding beyond the traditional classroom, two example activities, and a course syllabus as well as the set of statistical best practices for creating and consuming scientific information that we develop during the course.},

We specifically address this issue by exploring the longitudinal influence of a situational opportunity (referrals received from the central office) on intraindividual performance outcomes of sales representatives. We also explore Conscientiousness and Openness to Experience as traits that explain variation in adaptation to changes in referrals. Our results show that more weekly variation in individual performance resides within individuals than between individuals. A majority of this variance is explained by the situational opportunity of referrals. Furthermore, the positive relationship between referrals and outcomes is stronger for sales representatives high on Conscientiousness, but weaker for representatives high on Openness to Experience.

Yet, little is actually known about the reasons why objective performance indicators lack temporal stability. The authors address this issue by using data from a sample of 106 professional football players to explore how the actions of other people influence intraindividual variation in performance. Results suggest that weekly measures of performance outcome exhibit substantial variability within individuals. A significant portion of this within-person variance is explained by environmental fluctuation created by the constraining actions of other people. Individuals with highly fluctuating past performance exhibit stronger relationships between the actions of competitors and subsequent performance outcomes. The intraindividual relationship between fluctuating constraints and performance outcomes is also stronger for individuals in more complex jobs.

The nonrandom performance–turnover relationship suggests that dynamic performance studies may be biased by their elimination of participants who do not remain for the entire study period. The authors demonstrated that the performance slopes of those who leave an organization differ from the performance slopes of those who remain. This finding suggests that studies of the performance–turnover relationship need to consider employee performance trends when predicting turnover. Replicating and extending the research of D. A. Harrison, M. Virick, and S. William (1996), the authors found that performance changes from the previous month and performance trends measured over a longer time period explained variance in voluntary turnover beyond current performance. Finally, the authors showed that performance trends interacted with current performance in the prediction of voluntary turnover.},

  abstract = {The magnitude and variability of sex differences in vocational interests were examined in the present meta-analysis for Holland’s (1959, 1997) categories (Realistic, Investigative, Artistic, Social, Enterprising, and Conventional), Prediger’s (1982) Things–People and Data–Ideas dimensions, and the STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) interest areas. Technical manuals for 47 interest inventories were used, yielding 503,188 respondents. Results showed that men prefer working with things and women prefer working with people, producing a large effect size (d = 0.93) on the Things–People dimension. Men showed stronger Realistic (d = 0.84) and Investigative (d = 0.26) interests, and women showed stronger Artistic (d = −0.35), Social (d = −0.68), and Conventional (d = −0.33) interests. Sex differences favoring men were also found for more specific measures of engineering (d = 1.11), science (d = 0.36), and mathematics (d = 0.34) interests. Average effect sizes varied across interest inventories, ranging from 0.08 to 0.79. The quality of interest inventories, based on professional reputation, was not differentially related to the magnitude of sex differences. Moderators of the effect sizes included interest inventory item development strategy, scoring method, theoretical framework, and sample variables of age and cohort. Application of some item development strategies can substantially reduce sex differences.

  abstract = {Growing evidence on the predictive validity of vocational interests for job performance calls for greater consideration of interest assessment in organizations. However, a consensus on the fundamental dimensions of interests that are aligned with the contemporary world of work is still lacking. In the current research, we developed an organizing framework of vocational interests and empirically validated an 8-dimension model (SETPOINT: Health Science, Creative Expression, Technology, People, Organization, Influence, Nature, and Things). We propose that interests are structured hierarchically, with preferences for specific work activities at the lowest level (assessed using interest items), basic interests for homogeneous classes of activities at the intermediate level (assessed using basic interest scales), and broad-band interest dimensions describing general tendencies of individuals to be drawn to or motivated by broad types of work environments at the top. To derive broad-band interest dimensions, it is necessary to base it on a comprehensive range of content-specific basic interest constructs. In Study 1, we conducted an extensive review of existing basic interest scales and developed a new assessment of basic interests with 41 homogeneous scales across two samples. In Study 2, we demonstrated the structural validity of the proposed dimensional model using second-order confirmatory factor analysis and exploratory structural equation modeling with a large, diverse sample of working adults and supported its predictive validity for occupational membership in new and traditional sectors of work. We discuss implications from the current findings for building interest theory, using interest assessment for organizational research, and evaluating interest structure with appropriate methods.

Indeed for n{$>$} 2 it has evaded any exact solution. The present paper demonstrates that a simple solution, applicable to a wide variety of the cases that occur in practice, does exist. This solution may require the sampler either (1) to change some selection probabilities, or (2) to allow some variation in sample size. In the first case it is suggested that the changes in many cases will not be serious and may even be beneficial. In the second case the variance of the sample size can be shown to be small. The method proposed is particularly convenient for the sequential selection of units by computer from a list maintained in machine-readable form.},

  abstract = {Nearly all employment interviews, even those considered highly structured, begin with a brief meet-and-greet conversation typically coalescing around non-job-related topics (i.e., rapport building). Although applicants and interviewers often view rapport building as an essential, value-adding component of the interview, it may contaminate interviewers' evaluations of answers to subsequently asked structured questions (Levashina, Hartwell, Morgeson, \& Campion, 2014). Yet research has not determined the extent to which initial impressions developed during rapport building influence subsequent interviewer ratings through job-related interview content versus non-job-related content; whether these effects extend beyond more commonly examined image-related factors that can bias interviewers (i.e., self-presentation tactics); or how these effects are temporally bound when influencing interviewer ratings during the formal structured interview question-and-answer process. Addressing these questions, we integrate interview research with the extant social psychology literature to clarify rapport building's unique effects in the employment interview. In contrast to prior assumptions, findings based on 163 mock interviews suggest that a significant portion of initial impressions' influence overlaps with job-related interview content and, importantly, that these effects are distinct from other image-related constructs. Finally, initial impressions are found to more strongly relate to interviewer evaluations of applicant responses earlier rather than later in the structured interview.

We present an empirically and theoretically structured hierarchical taxonomy of 161 motives gleaned from a literature review from McDougall to the present and based on the cluster analysis of similarity judgments among these 161 motives, a broader sampling of motives than previous work. At the broadest level were: Meaning, Communion, and Agency. These divided into nine clusters: Morality \& Virtue, Religion \& Spirituality, Self-Actualization, Avoidance, Social Relating, Family, Health, Mastery \& Competence, and Financial \& Occupational Success. Each divided into more concrete clusters to form 5 levels. We discuss contributions to research on motives, especially recent work on goal systems, and the aiding of communication and systematization of research. Finally, we compare the taxonomy to other motive organizations.},

In Study 1, 26 cohabiting dual-earner couples reported on five consecutive days about their work demands and work resources, emotional support they provided to the spouse, and relationship quality among family members. Dyadic data analysis revealed that husbands’ work demands were negatively related to family relationship quality through reduced emotional support provided to their wives. Wives’ work resources were positively related family relationship quality through enhanced emotional support provided to their husbands. In Study 2, we explored whether the same gender pattern existed in the home-to-work direction. Sixty-four coworker dyads reported on five days about their home demands and resources, emotional support provided to their coworker, and relationship quality among team members. For male employees, home demands were negatively related to team relationship quality through reduced emotional support they provided to their coworker. For female employees, home resources were positively related to team relationship quality through enhanced emotional support they provided to their coworker. The findings suggest that relative to men, women prevent role demands from reducing the support they provide in another role and use role resources to enhance the support they provide in another role, thereby strengthening relationship quality in that role.

  abstract = {There has been growing interest in ethical leadership from both scholars and practitioners because of the positive effects that ethical leaders can have on their subordinates. These benefits come not only from ethical leaders acting as moral exemplars, but also from the tendency for ethical leaders to forge high-quality social exchange relationships with subordinates that help to establish expectations for appropriate conduct and ensure accountability through reciprocal obligation. However, the act of developing and maintaining strong social exchange relationships is resource intensive and requires considerable personal investment from ethical leaders. Extending current theory, we propose that wider spans of control attenuate the positive relationship between ethical leadership and leader-member exchange (LMX). Across two organizational samples, we developed and tested a moderated mediation model in which the effects of ethical leadership on performance, organizational citizenship behavior, and reduced production deviance via LMX were weakened by a widened span of control. Results in both studies supported the hypothesized model. Although it may be tempting to increase the number of subordinates assigned to ethical leaders in an effort to maximize their positive impact, the current findings suggest that the benefits of ethical leadership are diminished as span of control widens.

  abstract = {Although much is known about the harmful effects of perceived discrimination on employees’ psychological wellbeing, surprisingly few studies have examined why some individuals with stigmatized identities are able to rise above and overcome the effects of prejudicial work events. To address this gap in the literature, we integrate existing theory and research on workplace discrimination, mindfulness, and paranoid cognition to develop and test a dynamic, within-person moderated mediation model that explains why some employees are able to interrupt the process through which perceptions of discrimination lead to emotional exhaustion the next workday. Specifically, an experience sampling study conducted over two workweeks utilizing a sample of 105 transgender employees revealed that perceptions of discrimination predicted greater emotional exhaustion the following morning at work via heightened levels of paranoid cognition. However, trait mindfulness moderated this indirect within-person effect, such that individuals higher on mindfulness reported less paranoid cognition the morning after reporting discrimination at work and, in turn, were less emotionally depleted. By integrating the concept of mindfulness into the discrimination literature and examining the mediating role of paranoid cognition, the present study sheds light on one avenue by which employees with stigmatized identities are able to “weather the storm” of prejudicial experiences at work and has a number of key implications for future research on workplace discrimination, mindfulness, and paranoia.},

In results based on data collected from 64 cheerleading instructors via experience sampling, break activities are related to emotional experiences and positive affective displays. Moreover, suporting regulatory resource theory, break activities' impact on positive affective displays goes beyond the effects of emotional experiences. Our findings suggest employees' use of workday breaks can have practical implications for how they feel and perform at work.},

  abstract = {This longitudinal study examined whether employees can impact their own well-being by crafting their job demands and resources. Based on the Job DemandsϪResources model, we hypothesized that employee job crafting would have an impact on work engagement, job satisfaction, and burnout through changes in job demands and job resources. Data was collected in a chemical plant at three time points with one month in between the measurement waves (N ϭ 288). The results of structural equation modeling showed that employees who crafted their job resources in the first month of the study showed an increase in their structural and social resources over the course of the study (2 months). This increase in job resources was positively related to employee well-being (increased engagement and job satisfaction, and decreased burnout). Crafting job demands did not result in a change in job demands, but results revealed direct effects of crafting challenging demands on increases in well-being. We conclude that employee job crafting has a positive impact on well-being and that employees therefore should be offered opportunities to craft their own jobs.},

Issues such as distractions and their implications for test performance, changes to the applicant pool and their effect on adverse impact, and cheating and its impact on test scores must be explored.

  abstract = {Scholars have assumed that the presence of negative emotions during task conflict implies the absence of positive emotions. However, emotions researchers have shown that positive and negative emotions are not 2 ends of a bipolar continuum; rather, they represent 2 separate, orthogonal dimensions. Drawing on affective events theory, we develop and test hypotheses about the effects of task conflict on positive emotions and job satisfaction. To this end, we distinguish among the frequency, intensity, and information gained from task conflict. Using field data from 232 employees in a long-term health care organization, we find that more frequent mild task conflict expression engenders more information acquisition, but more frequent intense task conflict expression hinders it. Because of the information gains from mild task conflict expression, employees feel more active, energized, interested, and excited, and these positive active emotions increase job satisfaction. The information gained during task conflict, however, is not always energizing: It depends on the extent to which the behavioral context involves active learning and whether the conflict is cross-functional. We discuss theoretical implications for conflict, emotions, and job satisfaction in organizations.},

Internal knowledge sharing within a multiunit organization requires formal hierarchical structure and informal lateral relations as coordination mechanisms. Using sociometric techniques, this paper analyzes how formal hierarchical structure and informal lateral relations influence knowledge sharing and how interunit competition moderates the association between such coordination mechanisms and knowledge sharing in a large, multiunit company. Results show that formal hierarchical structure, in the form of centralization, has a significant negative effect on knowledge sharing, and informal lateral relations, in the form of social interaction, have a significant positive effect on knowledge sharing among units that compete with each other for market share, but not among units that compete with each other for internal resources.]},

  abstract = {Accumulated evidence from social and cognitive psychology suggests that many behaviors are driven by processes operating outside of awareness, and an array of implicit measures to capture such processes have been developed. Despite their potential application, implicit measures have received relatively modest attention within the organizational sciences, due in part to barriers to entry and uncertainty about appropriate use of available measures. The current article is intended to serve as an implicit measurement ‘‘toolkit’’ for organizational scholars, and as such our goals are fourfold. First, we present theory critical to implicit measures, highlighting advantages of capturing implicit processes in organizational research. Second, we present a functional taxonomy of implicit measures (i.e., accessibility-based, association-based, and interpretation-based measures) and explicate assumptions and appropriate use of each. Third, we discuss key criteria to help researchers identify specific implicit measures most appropriate for their own work, including a discussion of principles for the psychometric validation of implicit measures. Fourth, we conclude by identifying avenues for impactful ‘‘next-generation’’ research within the organizational sciences that would benefit from the use of implicit measures.},

  abstract = {The current study draws on work in the areas of team adaptation, team compilation, and small groups as complex systems to predict and test relationships between time, taskwork team mental models, team action patterns, and team effectiveness. Three‐person teams performed 9 scenarios of a firefighting simulation distributed over 3 days with discontinuous task changes introduced in the fourth and seventh scenarios (N = 41 teams; 123 individuals). We applied pattern detection algorithm software to the behavioral data to identify emergent performative patterns in the team members' task‐oriented actions. We also used discontinuous growth modeling to track the development of these team action patterns and their dynamic relation to team effectiveness. The results indicate that pattern emergence increased over time. This was particularly true for teams with similar taskwork mental models, and these teams also showed a more acute decrease in action patterns after a task change. In addition, team action patterns became increasingly positively related to team effectiveness over time, but this effect was reset after the occurrence of a task change. Overall, our research provides practical guidance to managers by illustrating the value of teams having highly shared taskwork team mental models and of enhancing the effects of teams' action patterns on team adaptive outcomes.},

Following a signaling perspective, we demonstrate that people derive information from the time that others needed in reaching a decision. Specifically, the findings of multiple experiments and a field study using data from the television show The Voice reveal that decision times are perceived as indicative of the degree of doubt that the decision maker experienced. In turn, these inferences of doubt reliably affected people’s preferences such as with whom to collaborate and negotiate, even when the collaboration would yield a normatively inferior outcome. These results are incompatible with the idea that an alternative will be chosen only on the basis of its outcomes. We portray a model that incorporates others’ decision times as a component of the choice process. Implications for how choices are affected by both outcomes and signals are discussed.},

  abstract = {Attitudes represent object evaluations, comprising complex underlying cognitive and affective knowledge structures. When people are asked to judge an object, they can use their primary response (i.e., the immediate object-evaluation linkage) or underlying affective and cognitive knowledge structures. In many situations, a primary response satisfices, but if not, more elaboration is required. Both processes are fundamentally different but may lead to the same attitude. For monitoring underlying processes during attitude expression, we developed an innovative eye-tracking procedure using eye-gaze on response scale options. This procedure was applied in three studies to identify the extent to which elaboration differs for attitude objects with weak or strong, univalent or mixed object evaluations (i.e., univalent, neutral and ambivalent). In Study 1, the overall judgment preceded processing of more specific affective and cognitive linkage evaluations. In Studies 2 and 3, the order was reversed, and affective and cognitive bases were assessed prior to overall attitude outcomes. For attitude objects with strong univalent or strong mixed object evaluations, we found similar outcomes on underlying processes. For weak object evaluations, cognition was found to be more predictive and easily accessible if an overall judgment was required first; affect for these objects was more predictive if people had to elaborate on affect and cognition first. We concluded that both affective and cognitive attitudes may require substantial elaboration, albeit in different situations. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {The use of validated employee selection and promotion procedures is critical to workforce productivity and to the legal defensibility of the personnel decisions made on the basis of those procedures. Consequently, there have been numerous scholarly developments that have considerable implications for the appropriate conduct of criterion-related validity studies. However, there is no single resource researchers can consult to understand how these developments impact practice. The purpose of this article is to summarize and critically review studies published primarily within the past 10 years that address issues pertinent to criterion-related validation. Key topics include (a) validity coefficient correction procedures, (b) the evaluation of multiple predictors, (c) differential prediction analyses, (d) validation sample characteristics, and (e) criterion issues. In each section, we discuss key findings, critique and note limitations of the extant research, and offer conclusions and recommendations for the planning and conduct of criterion-related studies. We conclude by discussing some important but neglected validation issues for which more research is needed. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

  abstract = {The extent to which test scores change upon retesting has important implications for both organizations and individuals who apply to those organizations. We review research on retesting and score changes that dates back nearly 100 years. Our findings suggest that compared to initial test scores, retest scores tend to be higher, more varied, and more reliable and tend to demonstrate somewhat stronger relations with criteria such as academic and job performance. There also is some evidence that retesting can change the constructs test scores reflect. However, empirical research has yet to clearly delineate factors that underlie such differences between initial and retest scores. We discuss implications of these findings for organizations and applicants. We also identify key unanswered questions about retesting that future research should address.},

  abstract = {This chapter describes the theory of planned behavior (TPB), a prominent reasoned action model, its conceptual foundation, its intellectual history, and the research it has generated. From its roots in propositional control and expectancy theory, the TPB emerged as a major framework for understanding, predicting, and changing human social behavior. According to the theory, intention is the immediate antecedent of behavior and is itself a function of attitude toward the behavior, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control; and these determinants follow, respectively, from beliefs about the behavior's likely consequences, about normative expectations of important others, and about the presence of factors that control behavioral performance. Empirical support for the theory comes from a host of correlational studies demonstrating its ability to predict intentions and behavior as well as from interventions showing that changes in behavioral, normative, and control beliefs can produce changes in intentions, and that these changes in intentions are reflected in subsequent behavior. The chapter also considers the TPB's reasoned action approach in the context of recent work on automatic, nonconscious processes in human social behavior. It is argued that insight into automaticity can complement the understanding of behavior provided by a reasoned action approach.},

  abstract = {Theories are the core of any science, but many imprecisely stated theories in organizational and management science are hampering progress in the field. Computational modeling of existing theories can help address the issue. Computational models are a type of formal theory that are represented mathematically or by other formal logic and can be simulated, allowing theorists to assess whether the theory can explain the phenomena intended as well as make testable predictions. As an example of the process, Locke’s integrated model of work motivation is translated into static and dynamic computational models. Simulations of these models are compared to the empirical data used to develop and test the theory. For the static model, the simulations revealed largely strong associations with robust empirical findings. However, adding dynamics created several challenges to key precepts of the theory. Moreover, the effort revealed where empirical work is needed to further refine or refute the theory. Discussion focuses on the value of computational modeling as a method for formally testing, pruning, and extending extant theories in the field.},

This special issue showcases how a temporal process-oriented lens can be used to study dynamics of workplace phenomena. In this editorial, we define the term dynamics, arguing that research on workplace dynamics focuses on how within-person (or more broadly, within-unit) processes unfold over time. Moreover, we zoom in on the diverse roles of time, illustrating the rich diversity in research on workplace dynamics, and we highlight three specific challenges for scholars wanting to pursue this line of research. We conclude that the time has come to move from a differential to a temporal and process-oriented perspective, allowing us to understand what happens, how things happen, and why things happen at the workplace.},

Process is often used in three ways in the literature: (1) a logic used to explain a causal relationship in a variance theory, (2) a category of concepts that refer to actions of individuals or organizations, and (3) a sequence of events that describe how things change over time. The second suggestion is to clarify the theory of process. An interdisciplinary literature review identifies four types of theories of process that can be drawn upon: life cycle, teleology, dialectics, and evolution. The third suggestion is to design research to observe strategy process in such a way that is consistent with one's definition and theory of process.},

I show that over one-third of US employment is in low-autonomy jobs and sketch an analytical framework for analysing job quality. Contrasting the four labour processes with various measures of job quality produces 18 job types that reduce to one of three job quality categories: good jobs, bad jobs and decent jobs. The typology provides a framework for analysing upgrading or downgrading of four aspects of employment quality within and across the four generic labour processes.},

  abstract = {The primary goal of this article is to demonstrate the close relationship between 2 classes of dynamic models in psychological research: latent change score models and continuous time models. The secondary goal is to point out some differences. We begin with a brief review of both approaches, before demonstrating how the 2 methods are mathematically and conceptually related. It will be shown that most commonly used latent change score models are related to continuous time models by the difference equation approximation to the differential equation. One way in which the 2 approaches differ is the treatment of time. Whereas there are theoretical and practical restrictions regarding observation time points and intervals in latent change score models, no such limitations exist in continuous time models. We illustrate our arguments with three simulated data sets using a univariate and bivariate model with equal and unequal time intervals. As a by-product of this comparison, we discuss the use of phantom and definition variables to account for varying time intervals in latent change score models. We end with a reanalysis of the Bradway–McArdle longitudinal study on intellectual abilities (used before by McArdle \& Hamagami, 2004) by means of the proportional change score model and the dual change score model in discrete and continuous time.},

  abstract = {The lead-lag structure of multivariate time-ordered observations and the possibility to disentangle between-person (BP) from within-person (WP) sources of variance are major assets of longitudinal (panel) data. Hence, psychologists are making increasing use of such data, often with the intent to delineate the dynamic properties of psychological mechanisms, understood as a sequence of causal effects that govern psychological functioning. However, even with longitudinal data, psychological mechanisms are not easily identified. In this article, we show how an adequate representation of time may enhance the tenability of causal interpretations in the context of multivariate longitudinal data analysis. We anchor our considerations with an example that illustrates some of the main problems and questions faced by applied researchers and practitioners. We distinguish between static versus dynamic and discrete versus continuous time modeling approaches and discuss their advantages and disadvantages. We place particular emphasis on different ways of addressing BP differences and stress their dual role as potential confounds versus valuable sources of information for improving estimation and aiding causal inference. We conclude by outlining an approach that offers the potential of better integration of information on BP differences and WP changes in the search for causal mechanisms along with a discussion of current problems and limitations.},

Findings from a longitudinal field study show that teams whose members share egalitarian values at formation develop highly interdependent task approaches and exhibit patterns of social interaction similar to those associated with high structural interdependence. By contrast, groups whose members share meritocratic values at formation develop low-interdependence task approaches and exhibit patterns of social interaction similar to those associated with low structural interdependence. Groups with shared hybrid or with mixed values show no consistent task structures or group processes, and significantly underperform relative to both the egalitarian and the meritocratic groups. We discuss the implications of these findings for the effectiveness of task-performing teams in organizations.},

Utilizing a controlled experiment and a hypothetical organization, Study 1 revealed that both Blacks and Whites spent more time viewing recruitment websites and better recalled website information when the sites included racial diversity cues. These relationships were stronger for Blacks, and organizational attractiveness perceptions mediated these effects for Blacks but not for Whites. Study 2 found similar relationships for Black and White participants viewing real organizational recruitment websites after taking into account perceived organizational attributes and website design effects. Implications of these findings for recruiting organizations are discussed.},

In a sample of 439 employees on 61 teams, the results show that when it comes to predicting individual performance (a) high TMX quality eliminates the otherwise negative effects of low LMX quality, (b) low authority differentiation weakens the otherwise positive effects of LMX, and (c) high skill differentiation weakens the otherwise positive effects of high LMX quality on performance. We discuss how the role of LMX may be changing in contemporary team-based work contexts relative to what was true in the historical literature when the construct was originally developed.},

  abstract = {Small mammal populations fluctuate erratically and exhibit seasonal and multi-annual variations in abundance. The decomposition of population dynamics into seasonal fluctuations, stochastic trends, and residuals helps to quantify environmental stochasticity of population dynamics. We used basic structural model (BSM), a state-space time series model, to decompose and de-trend 25 years of monthly live-trapping data for Microtus ochrogaster, M. pennsylvanicus, and Blarina brevicauda in east-central Illinois, USA. We further used Bayesian state-space models (BSSM) to determine the structure of within-year and between-year density dependent feedbacks in the stationarized residuals from the BSM for the three species. The BSM and spectral analysis identified significant seasonal fluctuations for the B. brevicauda populations. All populations of the three species exhibited strong stochastic fluctuations, but those of M. ochrogaster and B. brevicauda displayed greater environmental stochasticity than that of M. pennsylvanicus. The BSSM analysis indicates that M. pennsylvanicus was subject to density-dependence with a 4-month time lag, whereas the M. ochrogaster and B. brevicauda populations displayed 18- and 10-month delayed densitydependence, respectively. Moreover, spectral analysis suggests that none of the species exhibited multi-annual cyclic population fluctuations. Thus, both environmental stochasticity and density-dependence appeared to play significant roles in the population dynamics. State-space models are a promising tool for analyzing long-term monthly population time series.},

  abstract = {The full understanding of the behavior of any species must include biology, but at the present time there is no agreement on how comparisons between our species and others should be made. To a remarkable extent, people believe what they want to, as is clearly shown by the history of the interpretation of the behaviors of the great apes. When comparing human behavior to that of other animals, it is necessary to start with what is known about human beings and then to proceed to comparisons and evolution. Alternative procedures inevitably lead to reductionism and the loss of the very behaviors that make human beings unique. Language (speech and cognition) separates human behavior from that of any other animals and forms the biological base for the social sciences and the uniquely human history of the last few thousand years. With the advent of speech, learning takes on wholly new dimensions, and the relation between biology (nature) and learning (nurture) in human beings is quite different from that in any other animal.},

  abstract = {Low-fidelity simulations, which combine closed-ended response options with realistic depictions of key job tasks, have grown in popularity for several practical reasons. Research into low-fidelity simulations, which has focused primarily on text-based situational judgment tests (SJTs), has shown that such measures (a) can predict a wide range of criteria, doing so with moderate adverse impact, depending on the construct saturation of the items, (b) are no more susceptible to coaching/cheating/retesting effects than many other forms of assessment and far less susceptible than some, and (c) continue to struggle when used to measure a single construct. Practice, by contrast, has moved well beyond text-based SJTs to include multimedia SJTs, online assessment center exercises, and game-like assessments. Because these are perceived more favorably by applicants, the same research dedicated to text-based SJTs is needed to guide development of these newer forms of low-fidelity simulation.},

Recently, a great deal of attention has also been given to the positive aspects of multiple role engagement. In concert, findings suggest that role stressors are the strongest predictors of work–family conflict. The strongest predictors of role enhancement have yet to emerge. As will be discussed below, dispositional variables are likely a common predictor to both. Generally speaking, positive outcomes accrue to those that experience work–family enhancement while negative outcomes accrue to those who report work–family conflict.},

These key constructs are overall evaluative judgments about jobs, affective experiences at work, and beliefs about jobs. I show that clearly separating these constructs is consistent with current, basic research and theory on attitudes as well as with current research and theory on ‘‘subjective wellbeing’’ (SWB). I also argue that the separation of the constructs can produce better criterion predictions than job satisfaction has by itself, suggests new areas of research that cannot be envisioned when satisfaction and affect are treated as equivalent constructs, and requires the development of new measurement systems.

  abstract = {An unintended side effect of the goal-setting literature’s focus on cognitive dynamics has been an insufficient acknowledgment of how employees affectively experience high-performance goals. This is potentially a crucial oversight, considering the substantial body of research that has demonstrated the impact of employees’ affective states on organizationally relevant attitudes and behaviors. Drawing on cognitive–motivational–relational theory (Lazarus, 1991), we explore the discrete affective states elicited by high-performance goals. We suggest that a key to understanding these affective states is the source of the performance goal. The literature has largely considered whether goals are organization-set or self-set to be a peripheral aspect of a goal’s impact on employees. From an affective perspective, however, an employee’s self-set performance goals may be appraised and experienced quite differently than performance goals assigned by the organization. We build a theoretical model that suggests high organization-set goals will elicit anxiety due to an appraisal characterized by uncertainty and threat, whereas high self-set goals will elicit enthusiasm due to an appraisal characterized by positive expectations and benefit. We propose that these affective states will have diverging effects on employees’ emotional exhaustion and, subsequently, their extrarole performance. We support our model both in the field via a 4-wave study conducted with police officers and their supervisors and in the laboratory via an experiment in which we manipulated goal source during a performance task.

Promising new dynamical systems approaches to the analysis of large N, large T data sets have been proposed that utilize both between-subjects and within-subjects information. The COGITO project, begun over a decade ago, is an early large N ¼ 204, large T ¼ 100 study that collected high quality cognitive and psychosocial data. In this introduction, I describe the COGITO project and conceptual and statistical issues that arise in the analysis of large N, large T data sets. I provide a brief overview of the five papers in the special section which include conceptual pieces, a didactic presentation of a dynamic structural equation approach, and papers reporting new statistical analyses of the COGITO data set to answer substantive questions. Although many challenges remain, these new approaches offer the promise of improving scientific inquiry in the behavioral sciences.},

This commentary provides some plausible explanations for why this may occur as well as some tips for SJT development. In most cases, we frame the issue from an implicit trait policy (ITP) perspective (Motowidlo, Hooper, \& Jackson, 2006a, 2006b) and the measurement of general domain knowledge. In other instances, we believe that the issue does not have a direct tie to the ITP concept, but our experience suggests that the issue is of sufficient importance to include in this response. The first two issues involve challenges gathering validity evidence to support the use of SJTs, and the remaining issues deal more directly with SJT design considerations.},

The second section, devoted to difficulties in detecting interactions, covers such topics as statistical power, measurement error, distribution of variables, and mathematical constraints of ordinal interactions. The third section, devoted to design issues, focuses on recommendations such as including reliable measures, enhancing statistical power, and oversampling extreme scores. The topics covered should aid understanding of existing moderator research as well as improve future research on interaction effects.},

Across the samples, support was obtained for relations between personal/organizational characteristics and job satisfaction, and between satisfaction and commitment. Commitment was found to be an important determinant of turnover intentions. The results of the study present a challenge to previous models and research investigating commitment and turnover. Present research suggests that personal characteristics, work experiences, job characteristics, organizational factors, and role-related factors may influence commitment only indirectly.},

In addition, despite implicit understanding that advice networks aid performance through enhancing knowledge outcomes, only knowledge variety was found to mediate the relationship between external network and group effectiveness. Implications for theory and practice are discussed.},

To do so, we first clarify the terminological and conceptual issues that still cloud person-centered approaches. Next, we organize the diverse kinds of person-centered analyses into two major statistical approaches, algorithmic and latent-variable approaches. We then present a literature review that quantifies how these two approaches have been used within our field, identifying trends over time and typical study characteristics. Out of this review, we construct a unifying taxonomy of the five ways in which clusters are differentiated: (1) construct-based patterns, (2) response-style patterns, (3) predictive relations, (4) growth trajectories, and (5) measurement models. We also provide a set of practical guidelines for researchers and highlight a few remaining questions and/or areas in which future work is needed for further advancing person-centered methodologies.},

  abstract = {Gamification’ is understood as the application of game systems – competition, rewards, quantifying player/user behaviour – into non-game domains, such as work, productivity and fitness. Such practices are deeply problematic as they represent the capture of ‘play’ in the pursuit of neoliberal rationalization and the managerial optimization of working life and labour. However, applying games and play to social life is also central to the Situationist International, as a form of resistance against the regularity and standardization of everyday behaviour. In this article, the authors distinguish between two types of gamification: first, ‘gamification-from-above’, involving the optimization and rationalizing of work practices by management; and second, ‘gamificationfrom-below’, a form of active resistance against control at work. Drawing on Autonomism and Situationism, the authors argue that it is possible to transform non-games into games as resistance, rather than transferring game elements out of playful contexts and into managerial ones. Since the original ‘gamification’ term is now lost, the authors develop the alternative conception as a practice that supports workers, rather than one used to adapt behaviour to capital. The article concludes with a renewed call for this ‘gamification-from-below’, which is an ideal form of resistance against gamification-from-above and its capture of play in pursuit of work.},

Forty-two employees working in three branches of a fast-food company completed a questionnaire and a diary booklet over 5 consecutive workdays. Consistent with hypotheses, multi-level analyses revealed that day-level job resources had an effect on work engagement through day-level personal resources, after controlling for general levels of personal resources and engagement. Day-level coaching had a direct positive relationship with day-level work engagement, which, in-turn, predicted daily financial returns. Additionally, previous days' coaching had a positive, lagged effect on next days' work engagement (through next days' optimism), and on next days' financial returns.},

In our system, audio and visual channels are utilized to detect and classify emotional states for intelligent human computer interfaces. Our extensive experimental study on eNTERFACE database and RML database demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed multimodal emotion recognition framework based on integrated analysis of speech and facial expression. The experimental results show that the proposed methods are capable of providing improved performance. The comparison with other methods shows that the proposed twostage fusion platform outperforms the traditional algorithms in terms of both accuracy and reliability.},

While LBS confer greater connectivity and personalization on consumers, they also threaten users’ information privacy through granular tracking of their preferences, behaviors, and identity. To address privacy concerns in the LBS context, this study extends the privacy calculus model to explore the role of information delivery mechanisms (pull and push) in the efficacy of three privacy intervention approaches (compensation, industry self-regulation, and government regulation) in influencing individual privacy decision making. The research model was tested using data gathered from 528 respondents through a quasi-experimental survey method. Structural equations modeling using partial least squares validated the instrument and the proposed model. Results suggest that the effects of the three privacy intervention approaches on an individual’s privacy calculus vary based on the type of information delivery mechanism (pull and push). Results suggest that providing financial compensation for push-based LBS is more important than it is for pull-based LBS. Moreover, this study shows that privacy advocates and government legislators should not treat all types of LBS as undifferentiated but could instead specifically target certain types of services.},

Drawing from the emotional contagion literature and Conservation of Resources (COR) theory, we proposed and tested a moderated mediational model to examine the mechanisms by which social support received from one's coworkers contribute to the support recipient's work engagement. Employing data from a 12-week-long weekly diary among 142 acute care nurses, we did not find support for the proposed negative relationship between providing social support to coworkers and support providers' work engagement, nor for the overall mediational effect of the relationship between received coworker support and work engagement through support provision. However, we found that some work contextual factors (i.e., stable social support climates from coworkers and supervisors) moderated the weekly processes through which nurses' repaying social support received from coworkers predicts their subsequent work engagement. Specifically, providing support to coworkers had stronger beneficial effects on providers' engagement when coworker/supervisor support climates were relatively low; support received from coworkers had stronger indirect beneficial effects on nurses' engagement when coworker/supervisor support climates were relatively low. Our study findings highlight the complexity of the relationship between social support dynamics and work engagement, and that emotional contagion and COR theory may be insufficient, on their own, to explain social support dynamics between coworkers. We also discuss implications of the findings for managerial practices related to support dynamics at work.},

  abstract = {Although experiencing unfairness is a primary source of stress, there are surprisingly few studies that have examined the physiological underpinnings of unfairness. Drawing from social self-preservation theory, we derive predictions regarding the effects of interactional unfairness on activity in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis, which is one of the body’s primary hormonal systems for responding to stress. Using an experimental design with objective physiological measures, we found support for our hypothesis that interactional unfairness triggers the release of cortisol by the HPA axis. This cortisol activity in turn mediated the effects of interactional unfairness on deviant behavior. This indirect effect remained significant after controlling for established attitudinal and self-construal mediators of the justice– deviance relationship. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of these findings for the occupational stress and organizational justice literatures.},

Through 4 phases and using data from 1,408 participants, we established factorial, nomological, discriminant, and incremental validity of the social exchange orientation Scale and examined measurement invariance of the scale between samples from the United States and Japan. First, our findings indicate the newly developed scale for generalized exchange orientation (GEO) is distinct from measures of other forms of social exchange orientation and prosocial orientation. Second, the GEO Scale shows incremental validity as it predicts citizenship behaviors toward individuals above and beyond the key dispositional antecedents known in the literature. Implications and future research on generalized exchange are discussed.},

Earlier work in this area has modeled social networks with fixed agent relations. We instead focus on dynamic social networks in which agents can rationally adjust their neighborhoods based on their individual interests. We propose a new connection evaluation theory, the Highest Weighted Reward (HWR) rule: agents dynamically choose their neighbors in order to maximize their own utilities based on rewards from previous interactions. We prove that, in the two-action pure coordination game, our system would stabilize to a clustering state in which all relationships in the network are rewarded with an optimal payoff. Our experiments verify this theory and also reveal additional interesting patterns in the network.},

New methods for analyzing ILD have emerged under the multilevel modeling framework. In this article, we first delineate features of ILD (including autoregressive relationships, trends, cycles/seasons, and between-subject variability in temporal trends). We discuss the analytic challenges for handling ILD using traditional analytic tools familiar to organizational researchers (e.g., growth models, single-subject time series analyses). We then introduce a statistical approach for handling ILD from the multilevel modeling framework: dynamic structural equation modeling (DSEM). We provide three examples using simulated data sets to demonstrate how to apply DSEM to examine ILD with a software program familiar to organizational researchers (i.e., Mplus). Finally, we discuss issues related to applying DSEM, including centering, missing data, and sample size.},

However, the issue of how well-being evolves after individuals switch back into the labor force has received little theoretical and empirical attention. This study examines the extent to which reemployment restores individuals’ subjective well-being following a period of unemployment. Applying fixed effects models to the large-scale longitudinal data from the British Household Panel Survey, we find that recovery of subjective well-being upon reemployment is fast, complete and enduring, even when individuals take less favorable employment options to return to work. By contrast, transitions into economic inactivity following unemployment are accompanied by persistent scars on subsequent wellbeing trajectories. This study advances our understanding of well-being development over the entire employment– unemployment–reemployment cycle.},
