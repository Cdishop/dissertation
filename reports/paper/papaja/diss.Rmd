Organizational citizenship behaviors (OCBs) have been the focus of extensive scholarship among researchers and practitioners for more than 4 decades. Citizenship behaviors are actions conducted by employees that are discretionary and not necessarily associated with specific job requirements [@organ_organizational_1988], and they include behaviors such as helping colleagues after being asked for assistance or accommodating the work schedules of others when they request time off. Leaders put OCBs on equal footing to task performance when asked about the merits of different behaviors within their teams [@podsakoff_oxford_2018] and researchers have gone so far as to describe OCBs as a critical lubricant that enhances the social machinery of organizations [@bolino_citizenship_2002; @organ_organizational_2005]. Many studies document both the positive and negative outcomes of citizenship for individuals and collectives [@bergeron_organizational_2013; @bergeron_potential_2007; @podsakoff_individual_2009; @podsakoff_organizational_2000]. 

One topic of recent interest in this literature is a pattern which has been articulated using phrases such as “extra miler” or “good soldier” [@li_achieving_2015; @methot_good_2017]. These labels refer to an employee who consistently offers more OCBs than his or her colleagues – across an unspecified amount of time, he or she is typically one of the employees offering the greatest number of OCBs – and the presumed causes of this behavior are individual characteristics. Methot et al., (2017), for instance, argue that personality traits and prosocial motives are the research-supported causes of this pattern. Stated simply, an extra miler/good soldier exhibits sustained, superior levels of OCBs due to his or her disposition or attitude [e.g., @chiaburu_five-factor_2011]. This emphasis on individual characteristics is similar to the commonly identified predictors of OCBs in general, which include one’s prosocial motives, personality, impression management, propensity to be concerned for others, job satisfaction and commitment, perceptions of trust, fit, fairness, and ostracism [@lance_ferris_being_2019; @grant_good_2009; @meglino_considering_2004; @organ_meta-analytic_1995] (**HANDBOOK: BELLAIRS; KRISTOF-BROWN; PICCOLO**) and, at the within-person level, one’s positive affect, engagement, and perceptions of justice or supervisor support [@christian2015dynamic; @dalal_within-person_2009; @glomb_doing_2011; @ilies_interactive_2006; @matta_not_2020]. Indeed, @bolino_citizenship_1999 and @bolino_citizenship_2002 state that there is a consensus that OCBs stem from dispositions, motivation, and fairness perceptions.

There are three underdeveloped areas within the research on extra milers/good soldiers that the current study attempts to address. First, one way to view this literature is from the perspective of the fundamental attribution error [@ross_getting_2001; @gilbert_correspondence_1995] such that it is driven largely by person-oriented effects and, at times, downplays the role of the situation. Relative to the person-oriented studies, comparatively little research has investigated how the observed pattern – a tendency for an employee to be among the top citizens – may be a function not only of the individual but also the interaction between that individual and his or her situation. Focusing on the person by situation interaction is necessary because the same individual tendencies that yield a given behavior in one situation may manifest different behavior when circumstances change. 

Second, but related to the notion of a person by situation interaction, the conversation surrounding extra milers and good soldiers is missing an appreciation of the pleas for help employees receive over time. In their cornerstone paper describing its dimensions, @smith1983organizational state that many forms of OCB occur after a stimulus that “appears to be situational, that is, someone has a problem, needs assistance, or requests a service” (p. 661). Despite this initial emphasis, Ehrhart (2018) points out that there has been little follow-up research on the nature of requests and how they inform what we know about OCBs. Requests over time are necessary to examine for several reasons. They create a baseline for employees to react to, with some employees potentially receiving many more requests than others, have the potential to change whether a given amount of help should merit the label “extra miler” or “good soldier” (the same amount of help looks different if it follows 2 versus 12 requests for assistance), and several authors [@martocchio_employee_2009] (**Eharhart handbook**) argue that most acts of affiliative citizenship happen after a request to do so. In their review, @cain_giving_2014 SAY THAT THERE IS A NASCENT LITERATURE ON REQUESTS YET THEY HAVE HUGE POWER. NEED MORE RESAERCH. 

Third, just as the person-oriented effects occupy the foreground of this literature, researchers have tended to examine the systematic while neglecting the unsystematic. Moreover, researchers sometimes imply that systematic patterns – i.e., extra milers or good soldiers – cannot be produced by unsystematic causes, an idea that runs counter to the growing research on chance and random processes [@liu_good_2016]. To appreciate this assumption, it is useful to describe a study by @bolino_well_2015. These authors examine within-person variance in OCBs, depletion, and motives, and correlate the constructs over time. They motivate their study by arguing that it is unreasonable to expect (1) motives to be completely stable over time and (2) good soldiers, or employees that exhibit greater OCBs relative to their peers, to always be good. They then demonstrate that motives do show within-person variance and that they correlate with OCBs. What these authors imply is that sustained, exceptional citizenship (i.e., long-run “streakiness”) is unlikely when there is within-person instability in the variables that are assumed to cause OCBs. Said differently, when the causes are unstable (motives), the outcome must be unstable (OCB). This idea, though, contradicts what we know about stochastic (random) processes, particularly the notion that no systematic variance in the cause is required to produce what looks like long-run stability in the outcome [@henderson_long_2012]. If the cause is random and unsystematic, it is still possible – and in some cases extremely likely – that the response process contains systematic variance in the form of long-run streaks. What this means for the citizenship literature is that it is necessary to understand the role of randomness because the core idea underlying the notions extra miler and good soldier is that employee behaviors exhibit streakiness – a pattern which we know to be a possible byproduct of chance.

The key intuition is that two features of how help requests may compile over time -- inertia and randomness – interact with possible ways people respond to their stocks of help requests. 

# Theoretical Background: Person x Situation Interaction

Many theories suggest that employee behaviors are the result of a complex interaction between acting agents and their environment. Lewin's [-@lewin_field_1951] now famous assertion that behavior is a function of both persons and situations led to a flurry of personality theories examining person by situation interactions [Cognitive affective system theory; trait activation theory; whole trait theory; @fleeson_whole_2015; @mischel_cognitive-affective_1995; @tett_situation_2000]. Murray’s system of needs, which describes internal (needs) and external (presses) causes of behavior but “above all emphasizes the interaction between the two” [@epstein_explorations_1979, p. 652], is the foundation for several need-based models such as self-determination theory [@deci_self_1980]. The notion that behavior arises from the combination of one’s tendencies and circumstances is also described in theories of self-regulation [@dawis_note_1978; @deshon_motivated_2005]. Similarly, Blumberg and Pringle [-@blumberg_missing_1982] highlight the critical importance of adding opportunities to motivation and ability as key determinants of job performance because the environment can either enable or constrain performance [@johns_advances_2018; @stewart_adaptation_2006]. In the citizenship literature, researchers have examined person by environment effects but often from the perspective of fit or compatabiltiy such that there is a match between, say, one’s values and those enacted by the organization (**handbook kristoff brown**).

The current research uses Simon’s simple rules model [@simon_behavioral_1955; @deshon_clarifying_2009] as a theoretical starting point and builds from his account of the person by situation interaction. Across a number of papers, theories, and normative models [@simon_bounded_1991; @simon_rational_1956; @simon_what_1992] Simon argues that to understand the complex behavior of an agent it is necessary to describe (1) how goal-relevant objects are distributed around it and (2) the rules it uses to select courses of action. His framework suggests that the objects employees are confronted with over time combine with the mechanisms they use to select a response to yield a given behavior. The behavior that this study focuses on is the idea of a good soldier (extra miler). Applying Simon’s framework to affiliative helping suggests that, over time, an employee exhibiting extra miler behavior may arise from the combination of the requests she receives and her responses to those requests. That is, requests for assistance (situation) interact with employee reactions (person) to yield a behavioral pattern (extra milers/good soldiers). 

In the sections below, I articulate situation effects and person effects. 
PRODUCING SUSTAINED LEAD IS THE SITUATION EFFECT. I DRAW FROM PROBABILIY THEORY TO ARTICULATE THIS ASPECT.
Recall that another purpose is to counter the reasoning by bolino and suggest that causes need not be systematic. Unsystematic (i.e., random) factors can yield systematic outcomes. 

## Situation -- Requests Over Time & Sustained Lead

A request is defined as a notification to an employee that an act of assistance can be performed. Consider a few examples: A Professor receives an email from a colleague asking if she can substitute for an undergraduate course; An employee hears an announcement from a manager that volunteers are needed for an upcoming assignment; A statistician witnesses a question posted on a forum about a statistical model relevant to her expertise; A software engineer receives a pull request; An academic receives a note from a graduate student asking for a friendly review of his paper. Moreover, any agent may experience repeated prompts over the course of a week. On Monday, a Professor may receive an email asking for assistance teaching a class. On Tuesday, she receives two more emails about optional meetings in her department (attending optional meetings is one commonly studied indicator of OCB). On Wednesday, a former graduate student, who is now a faculty member at a different school, asks for a letter of recommendation. On some days the Professor has a large stock of help requests whereas on others she has few, if any.

Requests for help are related to ideas elsewhere. Entrepenaurs respond to opportunities that prompt them to enter the market [@short_concept_2010]. Employees enact job performance after being triggered by what Stewart and Nandkeolyar [-@stewart_adaptation_2006; -@stewart_exploring_2007] refer to as situation enabling factors. Safety reminders stimulate safety behaviors [@komaki_behavioral_1978]. Questions that interrupt a training intervention and prompt self-regulatory activity improve learning and performance [@sitzmann_sometimes_2010]. Prompts are also examined in selection [@levashina_structured_2014], forensic interviews [@sternberg_use_2001], and in event-sampling methodology where they are used to improve participant survey responding [@laurenceau_using_2005; @shiffman_ecological_2009]. 

What is missing in these other areas that becomes relevant as we consider requests over time is a discussion of sustained lead: some employees may consistently receive greater or fewer requests than others. The notion of sustained lead is well-known in literatures focusing on stocks other than requests [e.g., finance, strategy, mechanics; @denrell_random_2004; @henderson_long_2012; @akimoto_generalized_2008; @shreve_stochastic_2004]. It has not received attention in the citizenship space because studies do not often capture how requests compile over time (Ehrhart, 2018). Instead, most examine how to appropriately phrase a single, one-time request [@cain_giving_2014], leaving the idea of a stockpile unspecified. An employee’s pool of requests may change or stay the same as she moves throughout her week. Due to this fluidity, the size of her pool may be larger or smaller than her colleagues. Larger on some days; smaller on others, or vice versa. Sustained lead refers to a situation in which the rank order of a set of stocks remains stable over time. Applied to help requests, this would mean that employees with the most requests at time $t$ also tend to be the employees with the most requests at $t$ + 1, $t$ + 2, and so on. It captures the stability of relative positions, and it is worth considering for the following reason. If sustained lead occurs with requests, it establishes a situation where some employees continually experience more requests than others. It does not guarantee action but creates an environment with unequal opportunity. Recall that the core idea underlying extra milers/good soldiers is that some employees repeatedly exhibit more citizenship than their colleagues. Sustained lead may be one factor gently pushing in that direction. Of course, it also depends on how employees respond.

Simon’s (1955) situation by person framework suggests that the arrangement of objects in a person environment is one aspect influencing his or her behavior. In this research, I use requests over time and sustained lead to specify this broad idea. There are two schools of thought regarding the mechanisms of sustained lead: the random and the systematic. 

### The Random School of Thought

Probability theory and stochastics [@jaynes_probability_2003; @basu_introduction_2003; @levy_certains_1940] offer two features that are sufficient to yield sustained lead whenever they occur in tandem. These include inertia and randomness. 

**Inertia**. Inertia refers to the self-similarity of a variable from one moment to the next (**Cronin & Vancouver, 2020**). It can be thought of as conservation or persistence in the sense that the state retains its condition over time until something changes it. When an employee compiles help requests with inertia this means that he or she has a pool or store of help requests – three, for example – and this number is self-similar such that it carries-over from day to day. If the employee receives three help requests today, this number is added to the store of requests that she had yesterday, creating a total that moves forward into tomorrow. Similarly, when help requests are removed from the pool – which could occur, for instance, after she or someone else provides help and the request is resolved or when a deadline passes and help is no longer required – then it decreases by whatever amount was withdrawn. But removing a request does not drive the pool to zero. Instead, whatever amount was removed is subtracted from the total in such a way that the pool has inertia/memory – the amount changes from where it was at the immediately prior time point, it does not arbitrarily swing to zero. 

Weiss, H. M., & Cropanzano, R. (1996). Affective events theory: A theoretical discussion of the structure, causes, and consequences of affective experiences at work. In B. M. Staw & L. L. Cummings (Eds.), Research in organizational behavior (pp. 1–74). Greenwich, CT: Elsevier Science.

**Randomness**. The second feature is the extent to which requests compile randomly. The idea that chance has a stronger effect on people’s lives than often given credit for is expressed in social theory [@bandura_psychology_1982; @dew_serendipity_2009], probability theory and mathematics [@dobrow_introduction_2016], and among popular press [@taleb_fooled_2005; @mlodinow_drunkards_2008]. In the current research, the notion of randomness is drawn from the chance perspectives presented in @denrell_perspectivechance_2014 and @liu_good_2016. An employee that accumulates requests randomly means that the likelihood of receiving a request or having a request removed is pulled from a probability distribution such that both are equally likely. It is a coin-flip whether requests join or leave. Mathematically, an employee’s stock adds or subtracts requests based on a draw from a distribution $N(0, \sigma^2)$.

Probability theory demonstrates that a set of trajectories (e.g., requests over time for multiple employees) exhibiting both inertia and randomness generates sustained lead. In simple terms, there is a high probability that one employee will consistently have more requests than another if requests compile randomly with inertia. If inertia is not present, however, sustained lead does not occur (Table 2). 

### The Systematic School of Thought

Paste these cites from old word doc.

Other theories offer non-random sources of sustained lead. The principle of cumulative advantage [@aguinis_cumulative_2016] suggests that small benefits received during early periods fuel large gaps between “haves” and “have nots” at later stages. The mechanisms that create lasting advantages are numerous, and they include incumbency effects [@saloner_strategic_2001], path dependence (Arthur, 1989), first-mover-effects (Lieberman & Montgomery, 1988), switch costs (Klemperer, 1995), resource developments (Nelson & Winter, 1982; Dosi, 1988), lucky early detections (Barney, 1986), productivity multiplicity and ceilings (Aguinis et al., 2016), network effects (Gnutzmann, 2008), and Matthew effects (e.g., Vancouver, Li, Weinhardt, Steel, & Purl, 2016). Due to any combination of these features, employees may exhibit sustained differences in their resource pools (such as request for help). Social capital theory [@adler_social_2002; @nahapiet_social_1998; @galunic_positive_2012] also captures the idea of preserved differences in pools. Some individuals accrue large stores of social capital and are therefore differentially exposed to a whole host of aspects, some of which include information, social support, direct and indirect contacts, cutting-edge technology, trust, diverse perspectives, and unique communities [@hansen_search_1999; @inkpen_social_2005; @reinholt_central_2011; @seibert_social_2001]. Due to this exposure, then, employees with greater social capital may persistently receive greater numbers of requests than others.

Although I return to cumulative advantage and social capital in the Discussion, this research focuses largely on the random perspective for the following reasons. First, one core purpose of this study is to counter the reasoning by Bolino et al. (2015) and demonstrate that unsystematic factors can lead to systematic outcomes. As stated, their research takes the perspective that instability in the presumed causes of citizenship implies instability in citizenship itself. The current study suggests that even when an underlying cause of citizenship is unsystematic the observed behavior may still exhibit systematic patterns. Randomness is the quintessential form of an unsystematic effect, making it necessary to include in order to demonstrate this point. Second, Bandura’s theory of chance factors [-@bandura_psychology_1982] suggests that randomly occurring events often have a significant influence on behavior. This sentiment is echoed in several discussions of stochastic processes [@ross_introduction_2014; @tijms_understanding_2012]. For at least some subset of employees, the requests they receive may follow a random pattern. From a different perspective, @liu_good_2016 suggest that even when a system is non-random embedding randomness as a first principle into one’s research is necessary when the object of study – requests for help in this case – is influenced by many potentially uncontrollable forces. Help requests may come and go because of serendipity, luck, or influences that employees themselves do not cause. Moreover, the true causes of arrivals and departures may not be random at all. What @liu_good_2016 propose is that when many such effects operate on a stock then randomness can be an appropriate perspective because observed data on the stock itself will appear random. Fourth, @denrell_perspectivechance_2014 argue that randomness should be the theoretical starting point whenever research examines compiling trajectories in a new domain. Most research on compliance examines a single plea. This research, instead, takes a small step in the direction toward considering requests that compile over time. Following Denrell et al.’s (2014) recommendation, I start with randomness because little research exists on request stockpiling over time. 

The last reason is the most important: randomness can be an appropriate perspective at a given level of analysis. One of the main components in this research is the concept of a help request trajectory: a time-series representing one’s store of requests that can fluctuate up or down at each step. Although little research exists on these specific trajectories, there is a massive literature showing that randomness may appear whenever studies examine compiling trajectories. In economics, financial and visitor arrival trajectories exhibit randomness [@cooper_world_1982; @bhattacharya_testing_2005]. In biology, foraging and movement trajectories exhibit randomness [@hill_biased_1997]. In psychology, memory search and decision trajectories exhibit randomness [@hills_optimal_2012; @reike_one_2016]. None necessarily imply a fundamentally stochastic world, only that random movement exists at the level of an observed trajectory. Many trajectories captured in time-series data manifest random patterns – the same may occur for help requests. This does not mean that if we were to zoom-in to a lower level of analysis that the elements of the system would be random. They may not be. Everything underneath could in fact be non-random. The current research, though, is at a higher level of analysis focusing on the trajectory itself. At this zoomed-out level of analysis [@zaheer_time_1999], trajectories often express random movements. That is, despite non-random origins an observed trajectory at a higher level of analysis can fluctuate randomly from one time point to the next. A pool of help requests is one such “higher level” trajectory. For this reason, randomness isn’t something to be shunned but understood. By taking the random persepctive, therefore, I am not suggesting that received help requests are fundamentally random but that random movement may exist at the level of an observed trajectory. To the extent that random fluctuations appear in data, randomness is a meaningful perspective.

THESE CITES ARE IN NEWER WORD DOC.

The notion that trajectories with inertia and randomness exhibit sustained lead was originally expressed using Paul Levy’s arcsine law but it is now commonly referred to as the law of long leads in random processes. Sustained leads have been examined in studies of organizational age (cite), resource accumulation (cite), and firm performance (cite). The current article continues this research by considering requests for help as stocks that may rise or fall over time, potentially exhibiting sustained lead. Of course, to determine whether extra milers/good soldiers arise it is also necessary to describe the person. 


## Person – Responding To Requests

There is a large research body documenting what causes individuals to comply with a one-shot request. Typical effects include the attractiveness and tone of the person asking [@waddell_its_2015; @gross_beneficiary_1975; @fehr_obtaining_1979], the mood, arousal, empathy, and stereotypes of the person being asked [@paciello_high_2013; @cialdini_social_2004; @forgas_asking_1998; @florey_reactions_1997], the number of other people present [@yechiam_learning_2003; @barron_private_2002; @latane_unresponsive_1970], and the framing of the message [e.g., direct, urgent, positive, specific; @ellison_social_2014; @enzle_rhetorical_1982; @goldman_requests_1983; @graham_consultant_1998; @langer_semantics_1972]. There is less research addressing how individuals respond to a dynamic pool of requests. That is, reacting to received requests that continually update and may or may not compile into a large pool. To reason about this less commonly studied perspective, I draw from compliance techniques and self-regulation theory. 

**Respond to Many**. One way employees might react is that they offer greater help when request pools are large rather than small. Control theory suggests that people monitor discrepancies between current and desired states [@lord_moving_1994; @powers_feedback_1973]. At any fixed point in time, action is directed toward reducing a discrepancy such that people allocate resources until it is eliminated. When employees receive many requests for help, they may perceive a discrepancy that directs them toward action: current levels of help are not sufficient to deter incoming requests and so greater resource investments are required. With sustained lead, this type of responding would yield extra milers/good soldiers because the size of the request pool influences how individuals act. Employees with larger pools of received requests offer more help than employees with smaller pools. Moreover, larger pools persist under sustained lead. In combination, some employees would repeatedly offer more help than others. Without sustained lead (i.e., when requests compile randomly but without inertia), this type of responding would yield similar levels of help across all employees and would therefore not yield extra milers/good soldiers. 

Hypothesis 1: If requests compile with randomness and inertia and employees offer greater help when they have many rather than few requests then good soldiers emerge. 

Hypothesis 2: If requests compile with randomness but not inertia and employees offer greater help when they have many rather than few requests then good soldiers do not emerge.

Prediction from the systematic school of thought: identical to Hypothesis 1. If requests exhibit sustained lead and employees offer greater help when they have many rather than few requests then good soldiers emerge.

**Respond to Few**. There is also theory to suggest that employees may offer help when they have few rather than many requests. According to resource allocation theory [@becker_theory_1965; @hockey_compensatory_1997], people have a limited capacity to direct attention to multiple aspects of their work. With fewer requests, an employee may have more time and cognitive resources to devote to the individuals asking for help. Many employees, for instance, find that they can be more effective when demands do not stretch them too thin [@brown_attenuating_2005]. The same conclusion arises from an alternative perspective. Research on boredom [@guihyun_park_why_2019] suggest that low activity situations lead to associative thought which can prompt action. To the extent that an employee with few requests is less stimulated than an employee with many, he or she may experience greater levels of boredom which, in turn, acts as a catalyst for action. Bored employees, for instance, may become more creative [@mann_does_2014; @baird_back_2011] and effective [@gasper_approaching_2014] in their offer to help. With sustained leads, this type of responding would yield extra milers/good soldiers because help is driven by the size of one’s request pool. Without sustained leads, conversely, help would be similar across employees.

Hypothesis 3: If requests compile with randomness and inertia and employees offer greater help when they have few rather than many requests then good soldiers emerge. 

Hypothesis 4: If requests compile with randomness but not inertia and employees offer greater help when they have few rather than many requests then good soldiers do not emerge.

Prediction from the systematic school of thought: identical to Hypothesis 3. If requests exhibit sustained lead and employees offer greater help when they have few rather than many requests then good soldiers emerge.

**Respond to Influx**. Employees may also respond to the number of new arrivals. A commonly studied effect in social psychology is the foot-in-the-door (FITD) technique, which is a strategy used to secure compliance [@freedman_compliance_1966]. The core idea is that a small request is immediately followed by a larger one so that the target, after being lured by the original request, responds to both. Evidence for the effectiveness of this technique is mixed [@dillard_sequential-request_1984; @weyant_application_1996]. Moreover, studies often examine a single snapshot of back-to-back requests rather than a continual influx of requests over time. But in general, this research offers indirect support for the idea that employees may offer help when they witness an influx of requests. Research on the velocity aspect of control theory also suggests that employees may respond to the change (rather than size) of their request pool. Experiments show that information about one’s changing situation relate to affective and cognitive reactions when discrepancy sizes are held constant [@chang_moving_2009; @hsee_velocity_1991]. This type of responding would yield the same outcome with and without sustained leads. Help is based on request pool changes rather than size, so the effect of stable, sustained relative ranks in the size of employee request pools would be diminished.

Hypothesis 5: If requests compile with randomness and inertia and employees offer greater help when they experience an influx of requests then good soldiers do not emerge. 

Hypothesis 6: If requests compile with randomness but not inertia and employees offer greater help when they experience an influx of requests then good soldiers do not emerge.

Prediction from the systematic school of thought: identical to Hypothesis 5. If requests exhibit sustained lead and employees offer greater help when they experience an influx of requests then good soldiers do not emerge. 

**Respond to Outflow**. The alternative is that employees offer help when requests exit. The sibling compliance strategy to the FITD technique is the door-in-the-face (DITF) technique: start with a large request but quickly withdraw and request something smaller [@cialdini_test_1976; @cialdini_reciprocal_1975]. Evidence for this effect is also mixed but somewhat more favorable [@dillard_sequential-request_1984; @weyant_application_1996]. This technique suggests that employees may offer help when they experience requests leaving rather than arriving from their pool. Under this response, employees again react to change rather than size. The hypothesized outcome, therefore, is that good soldiers do not emerge irrespective of randomness and inertia. 

Hypothesis 7: If requests compile with randomness and inertia and employees offer greater help when they experience an outflow of requests then good soldiers do not emerge.

Hypothesis 8: If requests compile with randomness but not inertia and employees offer greater help when they experience an outflow of requests then good soldiers do not emerge.

Prediction from the systematic school of thought: identical to Hypothesis 7. If requests exhibit sustained lead and employees offer greater help when they experience an outflow of requests then good soldiers do not emerge. 

**Norm Conformity**. A final possibility is that employees look to their colleagues to determine how much help to provide. Research on conformity suggests that people often change their behavior to match the responses of others [@cialdini_social_2004]. They do so because they desire to form an accurate interpretation of reality or to obtain social approval [@deutsch_study_1955; @pan_social_2017]. Moreover, social impact theory [@latane_psychology_1981] suggests that people conform to the attitudes, beliefs, and behavioral propensities exhibited by the people in their surroundings (although not always). Employees may therefore try to match their peers, offering help in a similar way to what they witness among their colleagues. Indeed, research suggests that perceived norms and majority tendencies relate to one’s allocation of help [@bolino_citizenship_2009; @liu_organizational_2017]. The hypothesized outcome under this response is that extra milers/good soldiers would not emerge because employees look to others rather than requests to determine their allocation of citizenship. 

Hypothesis 9: If requests compile with randomness and inertia and employees match their colleagues in how much help they provide then good soldiers do not emerge. 

Hypothesis 10: If requests compile with randomness but not inertia and employees match their colleagues in how much help they provide then good soldiers do not emerge.

Prediction from the systematic school of thought: identical to Hypothesis 9. If requests exhibit sustained lead and employees match their colleagues in how much help they provide then good soldiers do not emerge. 

# Research Overview

This research was completed in two stages. In the first, I conducted a pilot study addressing the question, Is there evidence that requests for help exhibit randomness and inertia? Although such motion is commonly identified in other time-series data, little research examines whether help request trajectories display random movement. Assessing this first question was, therefore, necessary as a preliminary step leading to the substantive hypotheses regarding good soldiers and extra milers. In the second, I developed an agent-based model to assess Hypotheses 1-10. I obtained institutional review board (IRB) approval for this research from Michigan State University (IRB number). 

# Pilot

To assess whether at least some help request trajectories exhibit random movement I collected archival data from the Internet. I followed the theory-driven web scraping approach proposed by @landers_primer_2016, which states the following. Begin with a research question already determined and then develop a scraping approach to address it (rather than the other way around); Seek data that is indicative of the target behavior and justify how they align; Identify how the planned analyses inform one's selection of web data; Articulate the data structure and coding; Develop a script that pulls data and puts it into the specified structure. In this pilot study, the research question was whether help request trajectories display randomness and inertia. The planned analysis was to examine the presence or absence of randomness and inertia in time-series data using unit root tests (described later) -- and this analysis requires data structures with many time points. I therefore selected GitHub as a platform to scrape data from because it contains indicators of requests for help over long periods of time. 

**Issues on GitHub Repositories -- Non-Academic**. Data were collected from GitHub repositories created by software developers. GitHub is an open source website that allows users to store, manage, share, and collaborate on projects (repositories) and, although most use it for code, it can also be used for other types of documents such as Word files. The data I collected are known as repository “issues.” When an individual posts a repository/project, other users can then download and use the code that she/he created. If other users want to ask questions, request features, or report bugs, they can post an issue on the focal individual’s repository which automatically triggers a notification. The repositories I selected were posted by single users, rather than groups, to ensure that issues were targeted at one individual. Moreover, although it was possible for a single user to post and maintain more than one repository I obtained data on one repository per user. For a given repository owned by a single user, I collected all issues from when the repo was first created until the most recent post. This process was repeated for 8 different users. 

**Issues on GitHub Repositories -- Academic**. I also collected data from GitHub repositories created by academics. University faculty often use GitHub as a version control system when writing documents, as a platform to share, monitor, and adjust any applications or tools that they develop, and as a resource for downloading data science tools. Similar to above, I collected issues across 8 different repositories, each maintained by a single academic. 

For each of these 16 data sets, a help request was operationalized as an issue. For each issue, I collected (a) the date it was posted and (b) when it was removed or resolved, if ever. Issues can be removed or resolved through any number of means. The individual who posts it may figure out the problem on his or her own. If this happens, he or she can follow-up the original issue with another notification. It is also possible for the repository owner to respond and then close the issue. Alternatively, a "bystander" -- someone who did not post the issue nor did he or she create the repo but happened to come across the public system of notifications for any number of reasons (one being that he or she uses the code within the repository and so actively follows it) -- can send his or her own response. For any or all of these reasons, requests can be removed/resolved. Of course, it is also possible for them to lay dormant indefinitely. Following suggestions from @landers_primer_2016, both academic and non-academic repositories were included because it is possible to view various types of repository activity either as in-role or extra-role behavior. PODSAKOFF CHAPTER also note that the boundaries of citizenship are sometimes blurry because employees may believe certain behaviors to be in-role even though they are not part of a job description (and vice versa). In my view, repository activity is clearly extra-role for an academic whereas it may or may not be for a software developer. 

The final data structure included 16 time-series trajectories each representing the number of received help requests (issues) at a given time point for a single user. Number of time points. Descriptives on owners of repositories. 

### Analysis

Each time-series represents a stock of help requests over time, with greater values indicating more requests and lower values indicating fewer requests. For each data set, the pilot research question regarding randomness and inertia is evaluated by assessing whether the series contains a unit root. Unit root tests examine the presence or absence of random walks in time-series trajectories. For a larger discussion of random walks see [@kuljanin_cautionary_2011]. What matters for my purposes is that random walks contain both inertia and random movement, so when a unit root test cannot reject the presence of a random walk in a time-series then there is evidence that these features occur. Two unit root tests will be used. The first, the augmented Dickey-Fuller [@dickey_distribution_1979] test, is the most widely used statistic to evaluate the presence of random walks in time-series data. The null hypothesis of this test is that the data are generated from a random walk. There is also a unit root test in which the null hypothesis is instead the absence of a unit root, and the most well-known test of this second type is the @kwiatkowski1992testing statistic. Stated simply, if the ADF test cannot reject its null while the KPSS test can, then the two do not provide evidence against the idea that requests contain randomness and inertia. 

### Results



Data were collected on academics and non academics for the following reasons.

I determined that these people were academic or non-academic by...




Moreover, I did not scrape data on more than one repository for a given user even though it is possible for any user

did not scrape data on multiple repositoreis for a single user

It is possible for users to maintain multiple repositories, but I instead obtained data on a single repository for a given user and repeated this process for 8 different users. For a given repository

. Moreover, I collected data across 8 different (non-academic) users.  Across 8 different (non-academic) users, I collected I obtained issues over time for 8 different (non-academic) users, each monitoring a single repository. For a given repository owned by a single user, I collected all issues from when the repo was first until the most recent issue. 

That is, a single user has a repository that he or she maintains, and over time his or her repository has collected issues. All of the issues, from when the project first began until the most recent comment, will be collected and time-stamped. This process will then be repeated for another three software developers working in different industries on unrelated projects. Each developer has anywhere from 500 to several thousand time-stamped issues. 

One of the repositories is source code for a functional computer language built to create web applications. Another is a compiler to convert declarative components into JavaScript. The third is an application which corrects console commands. The fourth is a facial recognition application programming interface. Three of the four software developers work full time for a given company, whereas the fourth is an external consultant.

For each data set, help opportunities are operationalized as issues. Data will be collected on (a) the date that the issue was posted and (b) when it was resolved, if ever.


GITHUB ACACEMICCS.

I chose to use both academics and non-academics for this reason. 

Are OCBs part of job description? Yes and No. You could argue in different ways.
