Organizational citizenship behaviors (OCBs) have been the focus of extensive scholarship among researchers and practitioners for more than 4 decades. Citizenship behaviors are actions conducted by employees that are discretionary and not necessarily associated with specific job requirements [@organ_organizational_1988], and they include behaviors such as helping colleagues after being asked for assistance or accommodating the work schedules of others when they request time off. Leaders put OCBs on equal footing to task performance when asked about the merits of different behaviors within their teams [@podsakoff_oxford_2018] and researchers have gone so far as to describe OCBs as a critical lubricant that enhances the social machinery of organizations [@bolino_citizenship_2002; @organ_organizational_2005]. Many studies document both the positive and negative outcomes of citizenship for individuals and collectives [@bergeron_organizational_2013; @bergeron_potential_2007; @podsakoff_individual_2009; @podsakoff_organizational_2000]. 

One topic of recent interest in this literature is a pattern which has been articulated using phrases such as “extra miler” or “good soldier” [@li_achieving_2015; @methot_good_2017]. These labels refer to an employee who consistently offers more OCBs than his or her colleagues – across an unspecified amount of time, he or she is typically one of the employees offering the greatest number of OCBs – and the presumed causes of this behavior are individual characteristics. Methot et al., (2017), for instance, argue that personality traits and prosocial motives are the research-supported causes of this pattern. Stated simply, an extra miler/good soldier exhibits sustained, superior levels of OCBs due to his or her disposition or attitude [e.g., @chiaburu_five-factor_2011]. This emphasis on individual characteristics is similar to the commonly identified predictors of OCBs in general, which include one’s prosocial motives, personality, impression management, propensity to be concerned for others, job satisfaction and commitment, perceptions of trust, fit, fairness, and ostracism [@lance_ferris_being_2019; @grant_good_2009; @meglino_considering_2004; @organ_meta-analytic_1995] (**HANDBOOK: BELLAIRS; KRISTOF-BROWN; PICCOLO**) and, at the within-person level, one’s positive affect, engagement, and perceptions of justice or supervisor support [@christian2015dynamic; @dalal_within-person_2009; @glomb_doing_2011; @ilies_interactive_2006; @matta_not_2020]. Indeed, @bolino_citizenship_1999 and @bolino_citizenship_2002 state that there is a consensus that OCBs stem from dispositions, motivation, and fairness perceptions.

There are three underdeveloped areas within the research on extra milers/good soldiers that the current study attempts to address. First, one way to view this literature is from the perspective of the fundamental attribution error [@ross_getting_2001; @gilbert_correspondence_1995] such that it is driven largely by person-oriented effects and, at times, downplays the role of the situation. Relative to the person-oriented studies, comparatively little research has investigated how the observed pattern – a tendency for an employee to be among the top citizens – may be a function not only of the individual but also the interaction between that individual and his or her situation. Focusing on the person by situation interaction is necessary because the same individual tendencies that yield a given behavior in one situation may manifest different behavior when circumstances change. 

Second, but related to the notion of a person by situation interaction, the conversation surrounding extra milers and good soldiers is missing an appreciation of the pleas for help employees receive over time. In their cornerstone paper describing its dimensions, @smith1983organizational state that many forms of OCB occur after a stimulus that “appears to be situational, that is, someone has a problem, needs assistance, or requests a service” (p. 661). Despite this initial emphasis, Ehrhart (2018) points out that there has been little follow-up research on the nature of requests and how they inform what we know about OCBs. Requests over time are necessary to examine for several reasons. They create a baseline for employees to react to, with some employees potentially receiving many more requests than others, have the potential to change whether a given amount of help should merit the label “extra miler” or “good soldier” (the same amount of help looks different if it follows 2 versus 12 requests for assistance), and several authors [@martocchio_employee_2009] (**Eharhart handbook**) argue that most acts of affiliative citizenship happen after a request to do so. In their review, @cain_giving_2014 SAY THAT THERE IS A NASCENT LITERATURE ON REQUESTS YET THEY HAVE HUGE POWER. NEED MORE RESAERCH. 

Third, just as the person-oriented effects occupy the foreground of this literature, researchers have tended to examine the systematic while neglecting the unsystematic. Moreover, researchers sometimes imply that systematic patterns – i.e., extra milers or good soldiers – cannot be produced by unsystematic causes, an idea that runs counter to the growing research on chance and random processes [@liu_good_2016]. To appreciate this assumption, it is useful to describe a study by @bolino_well_2015. These authors examine within-person variance in OCBs, depletion, and motives, and correlate the constructs over time. They motivate their study by arguing that it is unreasonable to expect (1) motives to be completely stable over time and (2) good soldiers, or employees that exhibit greater OCBs relative to their peers, to always be good. They then demonstrate that motives do show within-person variance and that they correlate with OCBs. What these authors imply is that sustained, exceptional citizenship (i.e., long-run “streakiness”) is unlikely when there is within-person instability in the variables that are assumed to cause OCBs. Said differently, when the causes are unstable (motives), the outcome must be unstable (OCB). This idea, though, contradicts what we know about stochastic (random) processes, particularly the notion that no systematic variance in the cause is required to produce what looks like long-run stability in the outcome [@henderson_long_2012]. If the cause is random and unsystematic, it is still possible – and in some cases extremely likely – that the response process contains systematic variance in the form of long-run streaks. What this means for the citizenship literature is that it is necessary to understand the role of randomness because the core idea underlying the notions extra miler and good soldier is that employee behaviors exhibit streakiness – a pattern which we know to be a possible byproduct of chance.

The key intuition is that two features of how help requests may compile over time -- inertia and randomness – interact with possible ways people respond to their stocks of help requests. 

# Theoretical Background: Person x Situation Interaction

Many theories suggest that employee behaviors are the result of a complex interaction between acting agents and their environment. Lewin's [-@lewin_field_1951] now famous assertion that behavior is a function of both persons and situations led to a flurry of personality theories examining person by situation interactions [@mischel_cognitive-affective_1995; @tett_situation_2000; @fleeson_whole_2015]. (Cognitive affective system theory CAPS; trait activation theory; whole trait theory). Murray’s system of needs, which describes internal (needs) and external (presses) causes of behavior but “above all emphasizes the interaction between the two” [@epstein_explorations_1979, p. 652], is the foundation for several need-based models such as self-determination theory [@deci_self_1980]. The notion that behavior arises from the combination of one’s tendencies and circumstances is also described in theories of self-regulation [@dawis_note_1978; @deshon_motivated_2005]. Similarly, Blumberg and Pringle [-@blumberg_missing_1982] highlight the critical importance of adding opportunities to motivation and ability as key determinants of job performance because the environment can either enable or constrain performance [@johns_advances_2018; @stewart_adaptation_2006]. In the citizenship literature, researchers have examined person by environment effects but often from the perspective of fit or compatabiltiy such that there is a match between, say, one’s values and those enacted by the organization (**handbook kristoff brown**).

The current research uses Simon’s simple rules model [@simon_behavioral_1955; @deshon_clarifying_2009] as a theoretical starting point and builds from his account of the person by situation interaction. Across a number of papers, theories, and normative models [@simon_bounded_1991; @simon_rational_1956; @simon_what_1992] Simon argues that to understand the complex behavior of an agent it is necessary to describe (1) how goal-relevant objects are distributed around it and (2) the rules it uses to select courses of action. His framework suggests that the objects employees are confronted with over time combine with the mechanisms they use to select a response to yield a given behavior. The behavior that this study focuses on is the idea of a good soldier (extra miler). Applying Simon’s framework to affiliative helping suggests that, over time, an employee exhibiting extra miler behavior may arise from the combination of the requests she receives and her responses to those requests. That is, requests for assistance (situation) interact with employee reactions (person) to yield a behavioral pattern (extra milers/good soldiers). 

In the sections below, I articulate situation effects and person effects. 
PRODUCING SUSTAINED LEAD IS THE SITUATION EFFECT. I DRAW FROM PROBABILIY THEORY TO ARTICULATE THIS ASPECT.
Recall that another purpose is to counter the reasoning by bolino and suggest that causes need not be systematic. Unsystematic (i.e., random) factors can yield systematic outcomes. 

## Situation -- Requests Over Time & Sustained Lead

A request is defined as a notification to an employee that an act of assistance can be performed. Consider a few examples: A Professor receives an email from a colleague asking if she can substitute for an undergraduate course; An employee hears an announcement from a manager that volunteers are needed for an upcoming assignment; A statistician witnesses a question posted on a forum about a statistical model relevant to her expertise; A software engineer receives a pull request; An academic receives a note from a graduate student asking for a friendly review of his paper. Moreover, any agent may experience repeated prompts over the course of a week. On Monday, a Professor may receive an email asking for assistance teaching a class. On Tuesday, she receives two more emails about optional meetings in her department (attending optional meetings is one commonly studied indicator of OCB). On Wednesday, a former graduate student, who is now a faculty member at a different school, asks for a letter of recommendation. On some days the Professor has a large stock of help requests whereas on others she has few, if any.

Requests for help are related to ideas elsewhere. Entrepenaurs respond to opportunities that prompt them to enter the market [@short_concept_2010]. Employees enact job performance after being triggered by what Stewart and Nandkeolyar [-@stewart_adaptation_2006; -@stewart_exploring_2007] refer to as situation enabling factors. Safety reminders stimulate safety behaviors [@komaki_behavioral_1978]. Questions that interrupt a training intervention and prompt self-regulatory activity improve learning and performance [@sitzmann_sometimes_2010]. Prompts are also examined in selection [@levashina_structured_2014], forensic interviews [@sternberg_use_2001], and in event-sampling methodology where they are used to improve participant survey responding [@laurenceau_using_2005; @shiffman_ecological_2009]. 

What is missing in these other areas that becomes relevant as we consider requests over time is a discussion of sustained lead: some employees may consistently receive greater or fewer requests than others. The notion of sustained lead is well-known in literatures focusing on stocks other than requests [e.g., finance, strategy, mechanics; @denrell_random_2004; @henderson_long_2012; @akimoto_generalized_2008; @shreve_stochastic_2004]. It has not received attention in the citizenship space because studies do not often capture how requests compile over time (Ehrhart, 2018). Instead, most examine how to appropriately phrase a single, one-time request [@cain_giving_2014], leaving the idea of a stockpile unspecified. An employee’s pool of requests may change or stay the same as she moves throughout her week. Due to this fluidity, the size of her pool may be larger or smaller than her colleagues. On some days, for instance, she may have more requests than her colleagues. On other days, conversely, she may have fewer. Sustained lead refers to a situation in which the rank order of a set of stocks remains stable over time. Applied to help requests, this would mean that employees with the most requests at t also tend to be the employees with the most requests at time $t$ + 1, $t$ + 2, and so on. It captures the stability of relative positions, and it is worth considering for the following reason. If sustained lead occurs with requests, it establishes a situation where some employees continually experience more requests than others. It does not guarantee action but creates an environment with unequal opportunity. Recall that the core idea underlying extra milers/good soldiers is that some employees repeatedly exhibit more citizenship than their colleagues. Sustained lead may be one factor gently pushing in that direction. Of course, it also depends on how employees respond.

Simon’s (1955) situation by person framework suggests that the arrangement of objects in a person environment is one aspect influencing his or her behavior. In this research, I use requests over time and sustained lead to specify this broad idea. There are two schools of thought regarding the mechanisms of sustained lead: the random and the systematic. 

### The Random School of Thought

Probability theory and stochastics [@jaynes_probability_2003; @basu_introduction_2003; @levy_certains_1940] offer two features that are sufficient to yield sustained lead whenever they occur in tandem. These include inertia and randomness. 

**Inertia**. Inertia refers to the self-similarity of a variable from one moment to the next (**Cronin & Vancouver, 2020**). It can be thought of as conservation or persistence in the sense that the state retains its condition over time until something changes it. When an employee compiles help requests with inertia this means that he or she has a pool or store of help requests – three, for example – and this number is self-similar such that it carries-over from day to day. If the employee receives three help requests today, this number is added to the store of requests that she had yesterday, creating a total that moves forward into tomorrow. Similarly, when help requests are removed from the pool – which could occur, for instance, after she or someone else provides help and the request is resolved or when a deadline passes and help is no longer required – then it decreases by whatever amount was withdrawn. But removing a request does not drive the pool to zero. Instead, whatever amount was removed is subtracted from the total in such a way that the pool has inertia/memory – the amount changes from where it was at the immediately prior time point, it does not arbitrarily swing to zero.

**Randomness**. The second feature is the extent to which requests compile randomly. The idea that chance has a stronger effect on people’s lives than often given credit for is expressed in social theory [@bandura_psychology_1982; @dew_serendipity_2009], probability theory and mathematics [@dobrow_introduction_2016], and among popular press [@taleb_fooled_2005; @mlodinow_drunkards_2008]. In the current research, the notion of randomness is drawn from the chance perspectives presented in @denrell_perspectivechance_2014 and @liu_good_2016. An employee that accumulates requests randomly means that the likelihood of receiving a request or having a request removed is pulled from a probability distribution such that both are equally likely. It is a coin-flip whether requests join or leave. Mathematically, an employee’s stock adds or subtracts requests based on a draw from a distribution $N(0, \sigma^2)$.

Probability theory demonstrates that a set of trajectories (e.g., requests over time for multiple employees) exhibiting both inertia and randomness generates sustained lead. In simple terms, there is a high probability that one employee will consistently have more requests than another if requests compile randomly with inertia. If inertia is not present, however, sustained lead does not occur (Table 2). 

### The Systematic School of Thought

Paste these cites from old word doc.

Other theories offer non-random sources of sustained lead. The principle of cumulative advantage [@aguinis_cumulative_2016] suggests that small benefits received during early periods fuel large gaps between “haves” and “have nots” at later stages. The mechanisms that create lasting advantages are numerous, and they include incumbency effects [@saloner_strategic_2001], path dependence (Arthur, 1989), first-mover-effects (Lieberman & Montgomery, 1988), switch costs (Klemperer, 1995), resource developments (Nelson & Winter, 1982; Dosi, 1988), lucky early detections (Barney, 1986), productivity multiplicity and ceilings (Aguinis et al., 2016), network effects (Gnutzmann, 2008), and Matthew effects (e.g., Vancouver, Li, Weinhardt, Steel, & Purl, 2016). Due to any combination of these features, employees may exhibit sustained differences in their resource pools (such as request for help). Social capital theory [@adler_social_2002; @nahapiet_social_1998; @galunic_positive_2012] also captures the idea of preserved differences in pools. Some individuals accrue large stores of social capital and are therefore differentially exposed to a whole host of aspects, some of which include information, social support, direct and indirect contacts, cutting-edge technology, trust, diverse perspectives, and unique communities [@hansen_search_1999; @inkpen_social_2005; @reinholt_central_2011; @seibert_social_2001]. Due to this exposure, then, employees with greater social capital may persistently receive greater numbers of requests than others.

Although I return to cumulative advantage and social capital in the Discussion, this research focuses largely on the random perspective for the following reasons. First, one core purpose of this study is to counter the reasoning by Bolino et al. (2015) and demonstrate that unsystematic factors can lead to systematic outcomes. As stated, their research takes the perspective that instability in the presumed causes of citizenship implies instability in citizenship itself. The current study suggests that even when an underlying cause of citizenship is unsystematic the observed behavior may still exhibit systematic patterns. Randomness is the quintessential form of an unsystematic effect, making it necessary to include in order to demonstrate this point. Second, Bandura’s theory of chance factors [-@bandura_psychology_1982] suggests that randomly occurring events often have a significant influence on behavior. This sentiment is echoed in several discussions of stochastic processes [@ross_introduction_2014; @tijms_understanding_2012]. For at least some subset of employees, the requests they receive may follow a random pattern. From a different perspective, @liu_good_2016 suggest that even when a system is non-random embedding randomness as a first principle into one’s research is necessary when the object of study – requests for help in this case – is influenced by many potentially uncontrollable forces. Help requests may come and go because of serendipity, luck, or influences that employees themselves do not cause. Moreover, the true causes of arrivals and departures may not be random at all. What @liu_good_2016 propose is that when many such effects operate on a stock then randomness can be an appropriate perspective because observed data on the stock itself will appear random. Fourth, @denrell_perspectivechance_2014 argue that randomness should be the theoretical starting point whenever research examines compiling trajectories in a new domain. Most research on compliance examines a single plea. This research, instead, takes a small step in the direction toward considering requests that compile over time. Following Denrell et al.’s (2014) recommendation, I start with randomness because little research exists on request stockpiling over time. 

The last reason is the most important: randomness can be an appropriate perspective at a given level of analysis. One of the main components in this research is the concept of a help request trajectory: a time-series representing one’s store of requests that can fluctuate up or down at each step. Although little research exists on these specific trajectories, there is a massive literature showing that randomness may appear whenever studies examine compiling trajectories. In economics, financial and visitor arrival trajectories exhibit randomness [@cooper_world_1982; @bhattacharya_testing_2005]. In biology, foraging and movement trajectories exhibit randomness [@hill_biased_1997]. In psychology, memory search and decision mechanisms exhibit randomness [@hills_optimal_2012; @reike_one_2016]. None necessarily imply a fundamentally stochastic world, only that random movements exist at the level of an observed trajectory. Many trajectories captured in time-series data manifest random patterns – the same may occur for help requests. This does not mean that if we were to zoom-in to a lower level of analysis that the elements of the system would be random. They may not be. Everything underneath could in fact be non-random. The current research, though, is at a higher level of analysis focusing on the trajectory itself. At this zoomed-out level of analysis [@zaheer_time_1999], trajectories often express random movements. That is, despite non-random origins an observed trajectory at a higher level of analysis can fluctuate randomly from one time point to the next. A pool of help requests is one such “higher level” trajectory. For this reason, randomness isn’t something to be shunned but understood. 

THESE CITES ARE IN NEWER WORD DOC.

The notion that trajectories with inertia and randomness exhibit sustained lead was originally expressed using Paul Levy’s arcsine law but it is now commonly referred to as the law of long leads in random processes. Sustained leads have been examined in studies of organizational age (cite), resource accumulation (cite), and firm performance (cite). The current article continues this research by considering requests for help as stocks that may rise or fall over time, potentially exhibiting sustained lead. Of course, to determine whether extra milers/good soldiers arise it is also necessary to describe the person.
