# OCBs are reactions

OCB reflects affiliative responses to opportunities an individual has to help a coworker, respond to a request for information with courtesy, attend an extra meeting, be a good sport when things do not go well or as planned, and accomplish work with extra dilligence and care.

OCB's centerpiece is discretionary helping behavior that is not explictly required by the work role (Organ, 1988). Proactivity also encompasses discretionary and extra-role behaviors; however, such behaviors refer to self-starting behaviors that are future oriented and persistent in the face of obstacles (Frese & Fay, 2001).

The conceptual domain of OCB has recently been substantially broadened from its original conceptualization and operationalization (Moon, Van Dyne, & Wrobel, 2005; Podsakoof, MacKenzie, Paine, & Bachrach, 2000; Spitzmuller, Van Dyne, & Illies, 2008). It now includes a good part of proactivity as well. Even one of us wrote an article arguing that personal initiative was one form of OCB (Speier & Frese, 1997). However, we now concur with Bindl and Parker (2010) that it is useful and necessary to differentiate the two concepts (see also McAllister, Kamdar, Morrison, & Turban, 2007).

Conceptually, they are two different constructs. OCB is providing assistance to others, either colleagues or supervisors. Helping may be completely reactive or proactive (Spitzmuller & Van Dyne, 2013). Proactivity, on the other hand, is a manifestation of human agency to gain mastery over the environment and other people. Such change-oriented behaviors may "rock the boat," and thus proactivity may not be welcomed by coworkers or supervisors (Frese & Fay, 2001; Seibert, Kraimer, & Crant, 2001). 

That said, there is overlap EMPIRICALLY among the constructs. They share similar antecedents (personality, justice and leadership perceptions) and outcomes (task performance). Proactivity is predicted by cognitive ability whereas OCB is not.

A 1994 paper by Morrison ignited rethinking in this area. Building conceptually from research on X and Y, Morrison argued that BBB. She sampled 317 clerical employees at a hospital and presented them with a list of 20 behaviors taken from existing measures of OCB. For 18 of the 20 behaviors, more employees defined the activity as in-role rather than extra-role. In addition, she found ZZZ. Morrison then concluded III and introduced the concept of MMM. 

In the 20 years since Morrison's (1994) study was published, there has been growing recognition that the defining features of OCB are slippery constructs. Study. Study. Study. Study.
