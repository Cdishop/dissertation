Li proactive chapter about affiliative

Mimic intro where the guy said ocb theory is usually couched in SET or orientations (in good soldiers notes).

# Alternative: random walks on opportunities

# Opportunities

# Random Walks

# Statement

Goal is to show that OCB opportunities follow a random walk. 

If so,
- an alternative exists, contrary to prior explanations
- chance has not been ruled out
- researchers have identified spurious effects
- managers are focusing on the wrong things. They want OCBs...
++ if OCBs are due to personality and motive, that means find the right person
++ if OCBs are due to a random process on opportunities, that means identify opportunities

# Method

## study 1 Data

Show that OCB opportunities follow a random walk under various circumstances

## study 2 Simulations...what are the implications of various characteristics?

random walk vs white noise (denrell)
probability of causing ocb
trend vs no trend
