In the following sections, we illustrate how the DPM is related to three existing psychological models, self-complexity, risk and resilience, and self efficacy, and how key features of these models emerge from the DPM. 

Someone and somoene stuff stuff about adaptability. Consistent with Freud and Vaillant's observations about adaptation, our porfolio model posits that diversified investment in multiple life experiences, life roles, and relationships promotes positive adaptation to life's challenges. Our proposed DPM is also closely related to three theoretical models in psychology: self-complexity model, risk and resilience model, and social cognitive model. Although there are many other related models, we will discuss the linkage to these three existing models as an overview of the theoretical location of the DPM within the nomological network.
