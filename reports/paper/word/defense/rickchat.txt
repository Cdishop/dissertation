Big points

1.. Situation by person interaction

2.. Randomness as a perspective

3.. Person reactions to requests for help

Also consider (a) length and (b) whether or not an additional data set on my own emails is necessary.






Intro
- context: faculty are not happy

1) no abstract

make sure everything is appropriate. 
you wrote a journal article. 


2) first paragraph

ocbs only in response to requests or can they happen in absense. 

I'm setting it as the focus of OCBs. You need to set is as a limitation of my research. 

Generally, OCB people view this as a behavior in response to a request. I acknowledge that it is likely that ocbs happen outside of a request. the dominant perspective is X and I'm going to stick with it. 

3) fluff

need expansive. 2nd paragraph.
here are OCBs. here are onceptualized. here is how they are researched. 

4) 3rd paragraph for contributions

unsystematic vs systematic. Flesh that out. Confusing. 


5) table 1

Interpret table 1. Why do we need it?


6) re-state hypotheses

don't want them to appear mirror images of one another, with a null condition. they should reinforce one another. 


7) hypothesis 2

Good soldiers emerge because some folks get larger pools and so they have opportunities to respond to

as an artifact of the fact that the request pool.

"If they accumulate ...X and Y."


The idea of accumulation does not require the systematic school of thought. 

8) don't use the word compile

use the word accumulate





Post chat notes:

1) fluff, fluff, fluff. Background. etc.

2) hypotheses

3) accumulate rather than compile
