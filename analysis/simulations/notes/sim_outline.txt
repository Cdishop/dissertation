RWs:

random draw between 0 and 20
run over time. if < 0, make 0.

inertia means 1*prior. No inertia means 0*prior.


1a) respond to many: random & inertia
help is a function of pool size.

help = 0.5*num_requests

1b) respond to many: random & no inertia
help = 0.5*num_requests

2a) respond to few: random & inertia
help = 1/(1 + num_requests)


2b) respond to few: random & no inertia
help = 1/(1 + num_requests)


3a) respond to influx: random & inertia
help is a function of the draw: arrivals and departures of requests.

help = if(draw > 0)

3b) respond to influx: random & no inertia
help = if(draw > 0)



4a) respond to outflow: random & inertia
help = if(draw < 0)

4b) respond to outflow: random & no inertia
help = if(draw < 0)


5a) conformity: random & inertia
help is a function of what others are doing. 

z = conformity level

help1 = 0.5*num_requests

help_beyond =

ave_help1 or 0.5*requests with probability z choosing ave

5b) conformity: random & no inertia

I used a static group average. I could have also used a moving group average and the results would be the same. The value of the group average doesn't matter, neither does it matter whether the group average changes or not. What matters is that all of the employees converge on the same value at a given time step...not whether that value at the time step is the same as the last time step.
