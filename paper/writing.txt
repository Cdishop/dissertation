Imagine a close colleague that frequently agrees to volunteer for additional work when asked to do so. What causes her to act this way? Our intuition says that the cause must be something unique about her, a motive, personality trait, disposition, or her momentary enthusiasm. So it is with our research: the literature on correlates of why someone responds with help has focused almost exclusively on individual characteristics, such as affect, motives, attributions, justice or leadership perceptions, personality, and vigor. But this emphasis contradicts what we know about random processes, namely that long-run streaks of behavior can be by byproducts of chance. Because chance explanations have not been ruled out, statements about the necessity for organizations to monitor, evaluate, and influence individual characteristics to improve employee helping may be overblown. Moreover, a manager who reads this literature and then assumes that individual characteristics cause helping is more likely to falsely attribute good character to her employees when she witnesses helping, leading to performance evaluations and reward recommendations that are, perhaps, biased. The purpose of this paper is to find evidence of randomness in the requests that employees receive asking them for assistance. If we identify chance, then researchers, managers, and consultants must account for it if they truly want to know whether something unique about the individual, rather than something random about the situation, led to exceptional, long-run helping. In the organizational literature, helping or providing assistance to colleagues is referred to as organizational citizenship. 

Organizational citizenship behaviors (OCBs), or prosocial acts such as assisting others, volunteering for additional work, or speaking highly of the company, are increasingly emphasized in the organizational sciences (Dalal & Carpenter, 2018). Leaders put OCBs on equal footing to task performance when asked about the merits of different behaviors within their teams (Podsakoff, MacKenzie, & Podsakoff, 2018), and researchers have gone so far as to describe OCBs as the key social aspect driving organizational success (Bateman & Crant, 1993). Researchers, as well as consultants, managers, and employees, are interested in knowing why people differ on this behavior, and in particular why someone might have sustained, superior levels of OCBs over time.

Employees that exhibit sustained, high-levels of OCBs are labeled "extra-milers" or "good citizens" in the literature (cites), and researchers have identified a number of predictors of this behavior -- many of which are individual characteristics. These include prosocial motivation and personality (grant, 2008; penner, midili, kegelmey), impression management motives (grant & Mayer, 2009), one's propensity to be concerned for others (Meglino & Korsgaard), job satisfaction, perceived fairness, and organizational commitment (Organ & ryan, 1995), perceptions of trust (handbook moorman), fit (handbook kristof brown), leader fairness (piccolo), and interaction quality with colleagues (Bolino, Hsiung, Harvey, & Lepine), how employees appraise pressures to perform and goals (Welsh, Baer; mitchell, greenbaum, vogel), their level of engagement (Wang, Law, Zhang, & Liang, 2019) and mindfullness (hafenbrack, cameron, spreitzer, zhang, noval), and perceptions of ostracism (Ferris, Fatimah, Yan, Liang). Indeed, Bolino 1999, Bolino et al., 2012 state that there is a consensus that OCBs stem from dispositions, motivation, and fairness perceptions. 

Studies have also identified predictors of within-person OCB variance, but again many of these are individual characteristics. Antecedents include positive affect (dalal, lam, weiss, welch, hulin; glomb, bhave, miner, wall), job satisfaction (illies, scott, judge), social comparisons and beliefs in a just world (spence, ferris, brown, heller), core self evaluations and future orientation (wu, Parker), engagement (christian, eisenkraft, dapadia; barnes, ghumann, scott), and perceptions of justice or supervisor support (matta, sabey, scott, lin; schreurs, van emmerik, gunter, germeys).

We offer an alternative, perhaps simpler, model to explain sustained, superior levels of OCBs – one that does not rely on individual characteristics such as motives, attributions, personality, or fairness perceptions. The mechanism, instead, uses (a) opportunities, or signals that an act of assistance can be performed, and (b) chance accumulation, or the notion of randomly assembling components to an existing stock as an employee moves through time. To say that an employee randomly accumulates opportunities is to mean that he or she is confronted with requests, notifications, or prompts that signal to him or her that an act of help can be performed, and each of these successive cases then compiles into his or her existing pool. We show that whenever help requests follow a random accumulation process, then superior, sustained citizenship behaviors by one employee compared to others is not only a possibility but is the most likely case – it is to be expected. Even when two people have the same level of trust toward others, empathy, or prosocial values, one will have continual, superior helping due to the underlying, random accumulation.  Moreover, this result occurs even when the mechanism is identical for every employee. In other words, we show that vastly different observed citizenship does not depend on a unique causal diagram for every employee. The fundamental process – accumulation – is the same, but the manifest complexity leading some individuals to have greater citizenship than others occurs due to the unique gradient one experiences across time. Such an alternative explanation does not necessarily challenge existing ideas, but it has the potential to change our understanding of what generates sustained, superior behavior.

Apart from this first contribution, an alternative, parsimonious explanation regarding sustained, superior citizenship, additional contributions of this paper are as follows. First, we provide information to managers that can help them avoid misattributing causes of citizenship. If a manager were to take our literature at face value, then she should assess individual characteristics to monitor, predict, and manage helping behaviors. But such actions do not account for differences in help requests and the extent to which these requests follow a random process. Therefore, she cannot rule out chance when she witnesses sustained, high levels of OCBs and will potentially misattribute its cause to personality or motives. Any performance or promotion recommendation that she then provides -- which are outcomes of OCBs -- are given for the wrong reason. The employee behavior was not due to disposition, but chance opportunities. 

Second, we answer recent calls for a better understanding of dynamics in the citizenship literature (dishop et al., cronin). Dishop et al., argue that, although it is now common for researchers to assess patterns in longitudinal data, many of the current approaches miss several fundamental concepts of dynamics -- the notion of accumulation being one. We examine this principle here by assessing the extent to which help requests follow a random walk and therefore add more knowledge about citizenship dynamics to our literature. 

Third, we extend the OCB literature by examining the nature of help requests. When researchers discuss employee citizenship in handbooks (cite), theory (cites), or in empirical articles that originally introduced the concept (cites), they focus almost exclusively on help itself -- types, measures, predictors, outcomes, and its similarity to other constructs. But many types of helping are, by definition, tied to a request or prompt. For instance, in their chapter distinguishing OCBs from engagement, Newton and LePine (2018) suggest that citizenship is a response to an opportunity -- an act that follows a prompt for extra work or a request for information. Similarly, in their chapter distinguishing OCBs from proactive behavior, Li, Frese, and Haider (2018) state that, whereas proactive behavior reflects an employee volunteering help without a prompt, OCBs are actions that occur after a plea for assistance. Not all OCBs are reactions to prompts (cites), but requests are part of the definition of at least one major type of citizenship -- a type which some authors (Li et al., 2018) have argued should take the forefront of OCB research. Currently, we have many studies on helping but little on the nature of prompts. Our understanding of citizenship, therefore, is incomplete in that we have focused exclusively on one aspect of the definition of citizenship (i.e., the act), and not the other (i.e., the prompt). 



Fourth, we challenge an assumption about what creates long-run, exceptional citizenship. To appreciate our stance, it is useful to describe a study by Bolino, Hsiung, Harvey, and LePine (2015). These authors examine within-person variance in OCBs, depletion, and motives, and correlate the constructs over time. They motivate their study by arguing that prior research has assumed that people have stable motives and so "good soldiers," or employees that demonstrate supreme OCB levels compared to their peers, will always be good. They argue that this idea is unfounded and then demonstrate that motives do show systematic within-person variance, and that they predict OCBs. What these authors imply is that long-run behavior is unlikely when there is systematic variance in the variables that are assumed to cause OCBs. Said differently, when the causes are unstable (motives), the outcome must be unstable (OCB). This idea, though, contradicts what we know about stochastic processes, particularly the notion that no systematic variance in the cause is required to produce what looks like long-run stability in the outcome (cite). If the cause has no systematic variance, it is still possible (and in some cases extremely likely) that the response process does contain systematic variance in the form of long streaks of exceptional citizenship. Our paper, therefore, repositions how we think about long-run citizenship behavior.


Finally, this research generates new avenues; it points to unexplored scientific and applied questions that could lead to a flurry of additional work. These questions are unpacked at the end of the paper. The goal of this paper is to describe an alternative, chance model of long-run citizenship that incorporates opportunities and accumulation. Below, we describe OCB background and theory, the notion of extra milers/good soldiers, our alternative explanation for this effect, and explore evidence that opportunities follow a random accumulation process. 


# Organizational Citizenship Behaviors (OCBs)

The idea that there are employee behaviors beyond what we typically consider as job or task performance but that still promote individual and collective success has been around for decades. Researchers from psychology, management, education, human resources, organizational behavior, and sociology have different terms for this behavior, and different aspects that they emphasize, but in the organizational literature this behavior has come to be known as organizational citizenship. OCB is "individual behavior that is discretionary, not directly or explicitly recognized by the formal reward system, and that in the aggregate promotes the effective functioning of the organization" (1988: 4). It has been described as a behavior that “lubricates” the social machinery of the organization, thereby facilitating its effective functioning (Bolino, Turnley, & Blood- good, 2002; Organ et al., 2006; P. M. Podsakoff & MacKenzie, 1997). Related terms that are now less popular include organizational spontaneity (George & Brief, 1992), extra-role behavior (Van Dyne & LePine, 1998), and contextual performance (Motowidlo & Van Scotter, 1994).

Citizenship has consequences for both individuals and collectives. Employees demonstrating greater OCBs earn higher supervisor performance evaluations (e.g., MacKenzie, Podsakoff, & Fetter, 1991, 1993; Motowidlo & Van Scotter, 1994) and more awards and promotion recommendations (e.g., Van Scotter, Motowidlo, & Cross, 2000). Meta-analytic results suggest that individuals who consistently engage in OCB are less likely to express intentions to leave, to voluntarily quit, and to be absent from work (Podsakoff, Whiting, Podsakoff, & Blume, 2009). For collectives, greater levels of OCBs relate to higher performance quality, performance quantity, and customer satisfaction (Ehrhart & Naumann, 2004; Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Paine, & Bachrach, 2000), and some studies suggest that organizations competing in changing environments are especially dependent on good citizens because the goodwill and social capital they foster are a source of competitive advantage (Bolino, Turnley, & Bloodgood, 2002; Leana & Van Buren, 1999; Nahapiet & Ghoshal, 1998). There are also studies documenting the negative consequences of OCBs, which include reduced in-role performance, depletion and exhaustion, role overload, and feelings of resentment among peers (cites). That said, several researchers claim that OCBs should be thought of as a positive act, which is highlighted in the following quotes:

"There is considerable support in the literature for the idea that citizenship behavior at work is a positive thing"

"Theory and practice should acknowledge the sizable role good citizens play...because organizations rely on their continued investments"

Researchers typically pursue one of three broad ways to classify OCBs. Initially, OCB included two dimensions: altruism, or helping directed at a person after an eliciting stimulus; and generlized compliance, or an impersonal sense of conscientiousness. These two dimensions were later deconstructed into altriusm (respond to opportunities to assist a coworker), courtesy (responding to requests with kindness), conscientioueness (on time, following rules, etc.), civic virtue (concern for the organization), and sportsmanship (tolerate less than ideal circumstances while maintaining a positive outlook). Other researchers classify OCBs either as affiliative or challenging. Affiliative behaviors are acts such as helping and responding with courtesy in which the actor supports existing company processes. Challenging behaviors are acts such as voicing problems and initiating change in which the actor adjusts his or her circumstances. Finally, OCBs are also distinguished by whether they benefit individuals (OCB-I; helping, assisting, encouraging) or the organization (OCB-O; promoting the company to others). 

In this paper, we refer to affialiative OCBs whenever we use the terms citizenship, helping, acts of assistance, or OCB. This focus is necessary and appropriate for the following reasons. First, Li and Author spend an entire chapter describing the differences between affiliative (helping) and challenging (voicing) OCBs and argue that helping should be thought of as the core manifestation of citizenship because it (a) aligns with what most people mean when they study cooperation in the broader sciences, (b) is based on different evolutionary pressures than behaviors such as voicing concerns or actively changing circumstances, and (c) leads to construct contamination of unnecessary confusion if coupled with change-oriented behaviors. Second, Van Dyne et al., (1995) suggested that "the conceptual definition and subsequent operationalizations of OCBs should focus on citizenship behavior that is affiliative...and should not include challenging" (p. 274). Third, helping is the core dimension discussed in the original paper exploring the dimensionality of OCBs (smith, near) and within Organ's theoretical writing about the construct (organ cites). Finally, and perhaps most importantly, it aligns with the purpose of this study, which is to explore the random nature of prompts for help. For all of these reasons, this paper couches itself within the affiliative space of the construct.

# Sustained, Long-Run Citizenship

Recently, researchers have shown an increasing interest in employees that repeatedly exhibit greater OCBs compared to their peers. Li et al., 2015, for instance, studied manufacturing teams in China and examined the influence of team members that demonstrated high-frequency OCBs on team processes and effectiveness. The term they used to describe an employee who consistently helps more than his or her peers was an "extra miler." They identified the "extra miler" on each team by taking the person with the maximum helping behaviors as rated by his or her team members, and they found that extra milers were important for team monitoring and backup behaviors. 

Method, Lepak, Shipp, and Boswell (2017) describe a similar phenomenon in a theory paper explaining how employees make sense of life events and its implications for OCB. They state, 

One topic of particular interest in the OCB literature is the concept of “good citizens” —- employees who tend to engage in high levels of OCB (Bateman & Organ, 1983; Bolino, 1999; Bolino, Hsiung, Harvey, & LePine, in press; Li, Zhao, Walter, Zhang, & Yu, 2015; Organ, 1988; Vigoda- Gadot, 2006). Research suggests that good citizens characteristically perform OCB because of such factors as personality traits, including agreeableness, prosocial orientation and values, and proactive personality (Bateman & Crant, 1993; Grant, 2008; Meglino & Korsgaard, 2004; Penner, Midili, & Kegelmeyer, 1997; Schwartz & Bardi, 2001).

So, good soldiers or extra milers refer to employees that "characteristically" engage in OCB, or that exhibit greater helping compared to their colleagues time and time again. Such a pattern would manifest as long-run streaks of behavior, similar to a series of consecutive heads if one were to flip a coin one hundred times. 

What accounts for long-run citizenship? OCB antecedents were described in prior sections of this paper and included individual characteristics such as motives, affect, attitudes, fairness perceptions, and engagement. Similarly, Methot et al., point to predictors of long-run citizneship in the quote above: personality and prosocial values. We suggest an alternative: chance opportunities. Just as a series of consecutive heads could be a byproduct of chance events from flipping a coin, long-run citizenship could be a byproduct of random opportunities. Specifically, we point to the idea that helping prompts may follow a random accumulation process, which would manifest as streaks of exceptional behavior. Below, we articulate each of these pieces -- prompts and accumulation -- more thoroughly. 

# Prompts & Opportunities

A prompt, or signal to an employee that an act of help could be performed was a key element in early work on OCBs. In their foundational paper describing OCB dimensions, Smith, AUTHOR, Near (1983) state that helping occurs after stimuli that "appear to be situational, that is, someone has a problem, needs assistance, or requests a service" (p. 661). Despite this initial emphasis, there is little research on the nature of prompts in the context of help opportunities or requests (Ehrhart chapter). That said, there is ample theory elsewhere that describes environments and their relevance for behavior -- we draw from this literature to guide our discussion. 

Many researchers across several scientific disciplines have described the nature of situations and environments. Within this broad area, two ways to think about the environment are relevant to our purposes, which is to consider how help requests unfold over time. The first is as a platform, space, or zone which holds distributed goal-relevant objects. This perspective is consistent with much of Herbert Simon's writing that emphasized the importance of context for understanding human behavior. Across a number of papers, theories, and normative models [@simon_what_1992; @simon_rational_1956] Simon argues that the distribution of goal-relevant objects in an environment is a main component of any resulting complex behavior. Applied to the current paper on help requests, this notion embodies the idea that an employee experiences some distribution of helping opportunities, and to understand her behavior it is necessary to know the form of that distribution. To make his writing clear, Simon usually described this idea with a distribution over space, meaning that an agent was located in a matrix with a distribution of objects over cells. Here, we extend that idea to a distribution over time. Not only do employees receive help requests from different colleagues, they also receive requests of a single form from a single source repeatedly, and the characteristics of such requests create a distribution over time. 

The second perspective on the environment is as a shock or disturbance that makes opportunities come and go. Random stimuli occur and these factors impinge upon actors, allowing some behaviors and constraining others. This idea is consistent with the notion of shocks in the unfolding model of employee turnover in which discrete events thwart some opportunities and create others [@lee_alternative_1994], to events in affective events theory in which random stimuli cause changes in employee emotion and behavior [@beal_episodic_2005], and to the environment in Dishop's goal sampling theory [@dishop_simple_2019] in which actors are only able to approach goals made available by the situation at any moment in time. @blumberg1982missing define opportunities as "the particular configuration of the field of forces surrounding a person and his or her task that enables or constrains that person's task performance and that are beyond the person's direct control" (p. 565), and @stewart2007exploring demonstrated that even skilled and motivated workers cannot engage in performance facilitating behavior when their actions are constrained by the environment. 

Across all of these perspectives, the core idea is that there are opportunities scattered about the environment that come and go. The particular form of opportunity that we examine in this study includes help requests, or prompts that an act of help can be performed. Consider a few examples: A Professor receives an email from a colleague asking if she can substitute teach an undergraduate course; A manager announces that volunteers are needed for an upcoming assignment; A blogger tells his writing collaborator that she is welcome to review and edit his post if she pleases; A statistician witnesses a question posted on a forumn about a statistical model relevant to her expertise; A software engineer receives a pull request; An academic receives a note from a graduate student asking for a friendly review of his paper. Moreover, a single agent may experience repeated prompts over the course of a week. On Monday, a Professor may receive an email asking for assistance teaching a class. On Tuesday, she receives two more emails about meetings that are optional but nontheless important. On Wednesday, a former graduate student that is now faculty member at a different school asks for a letter of recommendation. Over time, the employee has a stock of help requests, and each successive prompt compiles into ther pool. 

The crux of this paper is that we expect helping prompts over time to follow a specific mathematical form. Specifically, we contend that requests may follow a random accumulation process in the form of a random walk. 

# Accumulating Requests As a Random Walk
