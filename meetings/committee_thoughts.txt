# Committee ready


1) OCB items

OCB desriptions of mesaures about capturing "reactions"

2) examples of github issues

3) examples of OCB opportunity emails

6) opportunity is a signal to an employee, so it's in the employee's head. Not objective.

7) evidence that opportunities produce behavior?
