OCBs are about cooperation within members of your own organization, aren't they?


(a) That's why I have both academic and non-academic

Github issues for academics is "outside" org

Githut issues for non-academics is "inside" org

(b) OCB-O

Keep up with developments in org
Defend the org when others criticize it
Show pride when representing the org in public
Offer ideas to improve the org functioning
Demonstrate concern about the image of the org

@ university, internal OCB

@ professional, service OCB
- chair at professional meeting
- officer for a professional association
- organize a meeting at professional association
- serve on journal editorial board

(c) Broader issue

I haven't seen a discussion of these issues. The most common "scope" issue is one of in-role versus extra-role breadth. Is this act part of your job description or not? Do you think this act is part of your job description? Do managers think that this act is part of your job description?

Perhaps this is a whole new area to explore. Do acts toward "the broader scientific community" count as OCB? Why can't Org Psychologists at large be the organization?
