# Key aspects to change based on proposal and committee feedback


1) introduction needs to be a contingency approach. person by situation interaction. 

couch this in other people's writing
- fundamental attribution error
- murray b = p, s, pxs
- davis same thing
- systematic and unsystematic

Broad, then zoom.


2) must have people responses in the simulation.

Some discussion of how people respond and put that into the simulation.

3) aren't you saying that requests for help are random?

No, I am not.

4) Someone will read this and say, "well cool but what I am talking about isn't random, or isn't at all related to what you are talking about; so put it aside and continue."
















# Fred Prior to Committee Meeting Feedback

Think about social capital and bandura chance factors.


1) Social Capital

Bizzi, 2015 (international encyclopedia of the social & behavioral sciences, 2nd edition, volumn 22

An outcome of helping. After you help, you accumulate social capital from your peers, and that gives you advantages (reputation, people like you, etc).

What I am talking about is potential capital. You haven't yet acted, but if you did it would give you social capital. 

2) comparative effectiveness research

NIH got sick of funding research from one perspective
- does cognitive behavioral therapy work?

Now, they fund research that is comparative:
- is cognitive behavior or interpersonal therapy better?

I am kind of establishing a similar argument in my paper.

3) Bandura random chance factors

Look up paper.

4) BBC article on opportunity structure

After the civial war, whites and blacks were equal in their level of poverty. After 3 generations, the whites were way ahead, essentially they were back to the advantages that they had before the civial war. Why?
- they had different opportunities


Bandura chance

Gladkova, 2017

Bandura conceptualises chance as‘an unin-tended meeting of persons unfamiliar with eachother’(Bandura, 1982: 748). He postulates thattwo sets of separate but interactive constructsshould be taken into consideration as we try tounderstand how chance affects the life course:personal determinants and social milieus. Onthe personal side, chance meetings are most likelyto affect life courses if they get converted into alasting relationship. Interpersonal attraction, aswell as personal characteristics such as people’sattributes, belief systems, interests, and compe-tences influence whether a chance encounter willturn into a strong tie or not. On the social side, theimpact of chance encounters depends on the‘holding and shaping power of the milieus into which people are fortuitously inaugurated’(Bandura, 2001: 12). Social circles with their be-liefs, value systems and prescribed behaviourpatterns, and the kind of people who populatethem make some chance encounters more proba-ble and leave a stronger impact on people’s livesthan others (Bandura, 1982).

1998 psych inquiry he talks about Krantz's view of chance events

Psychology of chance encounters (american psychologist)










# Rick After Committee Proposal Feedback


1) broad, then narrow

bandura
FAE
notion of situation and person and the interaction
rich get richer social capital and receiving requests

then you say. if you don't have the opportunity, none of this other stuff matters. That's what i'm focusing on. what's the impact of the opportunity?

Can keep the discussion of chance, but that should be the zoom in part


2)

solicited. Not opportunities. Requests.

3)

don't include academics in github requests.

4)

You don't need to include facebook data. But make sure the committee is informed about the decision.

5) add person into the simulations






# writing about proposal comments that I want to reflect on and wish I would have had better responses for.


AM1) I was thinking fundamental attribution error. How is this more than that?

It's silly, but I didn't go to FAE because I didn't want to make it sound like I was saying that other researchers were making an "error." That seems mean and unecessary. 

The other aspect is it has to do with a comparison. In my mind, and perhaps I'm wrong, but in my mind FAE says that I infer personal characteristics about you when I witness your outcomes and actions, whereas I focus much more on context when I think about myself. When I think about myself, I'm much more likely to acknowledge that uncontrollable situational things happen compared to when I'm thinking aout you. So my reading of that literature is that you have to be making such a comparison. 

In this research, I'm not talking about a comparison really. I'm saying that a mechanism on requests can yield a pattern. And if you view that pattern from the outside it could look a lot like someone's personal characteristics are driving the pattern. 

My paper is about the driving force that creates a pattern, FAE is about the person on the outside who is viewing the pattern. But yes I suppose I could cite it and just mention it.


Fred1) Missing the altnerative of social capital and how people accumulate requests through it

I respond to a request and I get AM to like me. Subsequently, she sends me more requests. Or, I help more than AM so people send requests my way in the future. Through the accumulation of social capital I acquare requests.

You should have competing models. Here is a model of random requests -- it's just a coin flip. Independent from moment to moment. And here is a model of social capital. Which one fits the data better?


** my response ** 

First, random walks aren't coin flips and independent from moment to moment. It's a coin flip about which way the walk moves, but the continuity is there. There is autoregression from moment to moment, there is a relationship between now and the next step. That's crucial. 

The second piece is really hard. It's a challenging idea to consider: the random walk isn't a competing model, it's a permission model. Here's the trajectory of someone's requests over time. This could be generated by any number of processes. One of them may be a social capital process, or it could be due to any other process. If I find evidence of a random walk, then I do not have permission to carry on. This trajectory is not sufficiently "non-random" to be able to parse meaningful from random variance. So we're done. It's a random walk, no meaningful model can be parsed.

It's just like a t test on a mean difference in a cross-sectional study. I have a mean difference but the difference is not so large that I can say it probably wasn't due to chance. Chance could have created this small mean difference. I'm done, there is no meaningful model to be parsed. There is no social capital effect to be understood. In cross-sectional research we typically don't focus on how cool it is that randomness can produce stuff, we focus on minimizing randomness to draw attention to other effects. The equivalent of my research in a cross-sectional study would be, look at this mean difference that randomness can create!! In my paper, I'm saying, "look at this trajectory over time that randomness can create"!!

Also keep in mind that it's possible that a social capital accumulation process could yield a random walk. In other words, you are describing it as if such a social capital approach wouldn't be consistent with a random walk trajectory. I actually think it could be because a random walk can have trend. 


Nick1) I think your two big statements are, (1) pay attention to the situation and (2) requests are random.

Yes and no. I am saying, (1) pay attention to the situation and (2) IF requests are random they can yield a meaningful pattern. (2) Requests need not be systematic to produce a seemingly meaningful pattern. Random requests may only be 15% of the population, or 5%, but they can produce a pattern.

Nick2) Ok, then people are going to downplay you.

Hmm, if requests are random then they can create this outcome. Cool. But the effects I'm studying aren't random so throw it aside.
