I want to say a few things. 

1. Higher level

At this observed level of analysis.

When I'm focused on the trajectory it's fair to use the word random because random walks manifest in these trajectories. 

2. Sustained lead

Even if something else is generating this movement, all I need is accumulation and sustaiend lead. I could get the same simulation output if I did something different.

Let me be clear. It would be extremely easy to run a "systematic" simulation (person A always gets more requests than others). That wouldn't change my hypotheses and it wouldn't change my output. 


3. Nobody looks

The last thing I want to say is that "I'm not sure someone can tell me that they know for certain that their domain isn't random because we don't evaluate randomness in our longitudinal data."
