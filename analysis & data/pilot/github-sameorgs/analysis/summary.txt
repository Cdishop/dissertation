77% of all walks contain unit root.

KPSS agrees with every dickey fuller test.


# sustained lead

Yup.

The folder, "sustained lead shortest series per org" has extra code. There, I ran bi comparisons using series lengths of no longer than the shortest person in the org.

In the base folder, the code assesses bi user comparisons with the shortest lengthened series of each pairwise comparison.
