That one should probably go :)  

As I understood from #41, this should be behind some sort of feature flag? How about this:

```php
		if ( is_readable( $preferred_mofile ) ) {
			$merge_translations = apply_filters( 'preferred_languages_merge_translations', false, $domain, $locale, $current_locale );
			
			if( !$merge_translations ) {
				return $preferred_mofile;
			}

			load_textdomain( $domain, $preferred_mofile );

			if ( null === $first_mofile ) {
				$first_mofile = $preferred_mofile;
			}
		}
```

A similar filter might be used to bail early, if removing that code has a considerable impact on performance. Haven't tested that, but maybe you can shed a light on that, since you bothered to add it afterwards in the first place :)

We need to clarify what ""partially"" means. Is there a German (Swiss) language pack for ""Plugin C"" installed on your site or not?

Language packs are usually only generated and downloaded if they are >90% complete.

If you want the German (Swiss) language pack even if it's only 10% complete and thus missing on your site, you'd need to use a plugin like https://wordpress.org/plugins/translation-tools/.

>We need to clarify what ""partially"" means. Is there a German (Swiss) language pack for ""Plugin C"" installed on your site or not?

We use custom client-specific plugins which we translate with Loco Translate. So language packs live in `wp-content/plugins/custom-plugin/languages/` and can be very incomplete (e.g. only 10% translated).

It's an excellent question and I totally understand your use case.

In some way this has been discussed in the past and the conclusion was that an automatic fallback and perhaps merge of languages isn't a good idea.

The usefulness of such a feature essentially boils down to how you're using the list of preferred languages.

When my fallback list is e.g. `es_ES -> de_DE -> en_US`, it would look really weird when half of the UI is in Spanish and the other half in German. And then here and there some English.

However, for `fr_CA -> fr_FR -> en_US` it's not a problem. Ideally, all your UI is in French. If not, some parts will be in English. But that was already the case when just using fr_CA -> en_US.

Perhaps `es_ES -> de_DE -> en_US` isn't the very best example, but I'm sure there will be cases where this could lead to weird results. So it's definitely not a one-size-fits-all solution.

However, for all the other cases where it might make sense, we can surely explore this.

(Of course the easiest solution would be to copy over all fr_FR strings to fr_CA if they haven't been translated already.)

Looking at the code I think this could be achieved programmatically rather easily. I haven't tested it, but https://github.com/swissspidy/preferred-languages/commit/4c78495d46ae4010b19b6d57ec7ba69a4452ef8e is what I had in mind.",NA,https://api.github.com/repos/swissspidy/preferred-languages/issues/41/comments,https://github.com/swissspidy/preferred-languages/issues/41#issuecomment-428978675,https://api.github.com/repos/swissspidy/preferred-languages/issues/41

It is already going to be weird if plugin A is only translated in es_ES and plugin B is only translated in de_DE. Right ?

Maybe my proposal could be applied only it they all come from the same language.

In the Dashboard, I might prefer `fr_CA -> en_US`as a translator. But on the front-end of the website, I can't see a use case where I'd want the website to be half in fr_CA and half in en_US instead of taking as many strings as possible from fr_CA and filling, for instance, the missing strings with fr_FR or fr_BE.

Is is clearer ?

As I said in https://github.com/swissspidy/preferred-languages/issues/41#issuecomment-428978675, it isn't the best example. I tried to exaggerate to prove a point. A more reasonable problem could be something like `roh -> it -> de_DE -> en_US`. Still the same problem though.

That's true 🙂

Yeah, since this really depends on the context, this couldn't be done automatically for everyone. I'll experiment with adding a filter that one can use if they want this delta to happen in that specific scenario.

What I did:

1. Remove all translation files
2. Clear preferred locales setting and save them.
3. Add a few locales and save them.
4. Notice how all translation files are downloaded.

When not all translations are downloaded, it's most likely because of an HTTP timeout or similar in the WordPress internals.

To account for this, I'm going to adjust the plugin in a way that you can just re-save the settings and the plugin will try to download the translations if they're not available yet. So if you update your settings and nothing happens, just press the update button once again.

Also, I think I'm going to add a small warning in that case, e.g. ""Hey, your preferred locales are de_CH and de_DE, but they aren't installed. Please re-save your settings"".

----

@daveloodts Good point regarding the updates screen! That indeed does only install one locale.

The tricky thing there is that WordPress only checks for updates for the current locale (i.e. the first one in the list).

That's correct, yes. However, there _could_ be, e.g. when manually added by someone to override some strings.

Note that it doesn't really matter where `en_US` is in the list.

I've been thinking about that situation a few times and I'm not sure yet how this should be handled.

One option would be to modify `preferred_languages_load_textdomain_mofile()` so it returns true for `en_US`, but then it wouldn't make sense to have anything after en_US, because it would never be loaded.

Another option is to disallow selecting en_US in the drop down. Then, when you remove all locales from the list, there would be some kind of note like ""Nothing set, falling back to English (US)"".

Ideally, the text in the left column should be used for this purpose; unfortunately the Settings API doesn't allow to add an `id` there, unless passing some HTML to the `title`. This would be easier in the user profile page, since there's more control over the HTML output.

> Authors should provide a way to expose keyboard shortcuts so that all users may discover them, such as through the use of a tooltip.

However, the introduction of tooltips would probably be a bit controversial, even if TinyMCE is already using them.

I'd consider to add some general info about the new UI in the Help tab at the top of the page, that could include also some info about the shortcuts. It won't completely solve the issue, but could help.

I've initially considered aria-labels, for example:
`<button aria-label=""Move down (Alt+ArrowDown)"" aria-keyshortcuts=""Alt+ArrowDown"" ... >Move Down</button>`
but that would be redundant and would defeat the purpose of `aria-keyshortcuts` (when it will be supported). A while ago in an accessibility meeting, we were wondering about the need of a new [""inline help system""](https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/accessibility/p1420678367000781) but that would be definitely out of the scope of this project.

Unrelated:
I'd consider to add audible feedback when locales get added, moved up/down or removed, currently there's no feedback. For inspiration, the customizer already does something similar for menu items and widgets, see for example:
'Menu item moved up'
'Menu item moved down'
'Menu item added'
'Menu item deleted'
'Widget moved up'
etc.

Thanks so much for spending time on this. The current write package should probably be considered more of a ""draft""--lots of tires to kick. It was a known issue (that simplified some internal assumptions) that reading and then immediately writing out DICOMs would not be byte-for-byte equal, but they should be conformant DICOMs. 

One of these assumptions is that we would _always_ write out files in little endian implicit regardless of the input files, which may lead to this issue. 

I think it would be good to work towards byte-for-byte equal, but I think it's a tradeoff between complexity and functionality--writing out an equivalent, fully conformant DICOM is a good first goal.

I'm not sure if we need to test bit-for-bit identity yet (I don't think that will pass). We do already have a write test that tests [roundtripping within this library](https://github.com/suyashkumar/dicom/blob/8494b8d69903e329beeff4306605ded5dd702a7a/write_test.go#L28) (e.g. write out a known dataset, and then read it back in and see that it's exactly equal to the original known dataset).

I think a python-linked test that tests we can parse the written dicom by pydicom is certainly a good one. We will have to think about what the best test infrastructure for that would be. (Currently the development setup is very simple and doesn't rely on python, which is nice). One option is to detail the python requirements, and have a helper script setup a python envrironment for running this test (perhaps it should be seperate from the typical go test that runs by default). We should definitly make sure this test always runs on CI, and locally you can specifically go to that test and run it if needed, but may not run as part of `go test ./...` (we could probably also have `make test` run the python setup and run the test if needed).

For the python stuff locally, it would probably be good to run the test in a `virtualenv` so as to not interact with the system python installation. I am pretty wary about adding a hard python dependency for local development, but certainly as a test suite that runs on CI I am good with at the moment

Thanks, that's good context to have. Do you think it would be worth putting that somewhere near the beginning of the README and / or Docs as a warning to developers looking at this lib for DICOM writes? Since the lib is 1.0 some users may find it surprising, but a warning near the beginning on the write feature would make it quick to discover.

> We do already have a write test that tests roundtripping within this library (e.g. write out a known dataset, and then read it back in and see that it's exactly equal to the original known dataset).

Totally, I think it's good to have targeted tests like the ones currently in the write feature, where you know EXACTLY what values are involved.

I also think it's worth while to have a round-trip test of non-synthesized data, where we pull in a number of *full* DICOMS with real-world data and make sure every element in them is correctly read, written, and read again. That was what let me find #199 and #193. And the tests as-written would be easy to expand to larger test datasets, should we want. Further down, I discuss using build tags for some, more complicated tests. So maybe we could add an `integration` tag for these tests so they are not run by default, but are still run on CI or when a developer wants to run the full test suite.

> I think it would be good to work towards byte-for-byte equal, but I think it's a tradeoff between complexity and functionality--writing out an equivalent, fully conformant DICOM is a good first goal.

Agreed completely. 

> I'm not sure if we need to test bit-for-bit identity yet (I don't think that will pass). 

Also agreed, although we could always call t.Skip() on it for now and leave it in as an aspirational test if bit-for-bit parse / write is something you would like to strive for *in general* in the future, anyone working towards that goal then has a pre-wrritten set of tests they can re-enable if they so desire.

> We should definitly make sure this test always runs on CI, and locally you can specifically go to that test and run it if needed, but may not run as part of go test ./... (we could probably also have make test run the python setup and run the test if needed).

I think this a natural use case for [build tags](https://mickey.dev/posts/go-build-tags-testing/), IMO. That way by default, developers don't have to worry themselves with setting up python unless they want to, while requiring minimal scripting on our part. We could have a `validation` build tag, and maybe also have a `bytes_symmetry` tag for the bit-for-but tests instead of using t.Skip().

Then we could have `make test` run the basic tests using the current test command and maybe `make tests-validation` run
`go test ./... -v -tags=validation` and `make test-future` run `go test ./... tags=bytes_symmetry` or something like that. I've also been looking into other third-party dicom validation tools, so we could add other tests as well that call other third-party validation tools.

> For the python stuff locally, it would probably be good to run the test in a virtualenv so as to not interact with the system python installation. 

IMO, this is a choice we should leave to the developer. I use `python -m venv` to setup my virtual environments, but some people use [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv), and still others use [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/). I think having a `python_requirements.txt` file and an explanation in the readme is probably enough to let anyone who wants to run those tests locally to run them without having to do too much setup, and for CI I don't think there's much of a problem using the system Python.

I'll open a couple draft PR's for the tings discussed here, and we can maybe discuss the pros and cons of the individual elements there and close this issue.

For instance, you can now write a helper function like this:

```go
// DCMTime is a common interface for dcmtime.Date, dcmtime.Time, and dcmtime.Datetime.
type DCMTime interface {
	GetTime() time.Time
	GetPrecision() dcmtime.PrecisionLevel
	DCM() string
}

func InspectDICOMTimeVal(value DCMTime) error {
	// Do something with this value
	return nil
}
```

The main addition here is adding a `GetTime()` and `GetPrecision()` method to each of the dcmtime types. I've been writing some code where a single code path could be used with an interface like this, so I decided it was worth adding in. Callers could do this though wrappers on their own, but having it right out of the box is kind of nice, IMO.

Thanks for raising the issue and for posting a great minimal example. I agree that this is something we should address, particularly since that Go routine holds a reference to the read dataset (so the dataset presumably isn't cleaned up during GC even when it's not needed).

Semantically, I think using a context is reasonable though it's easy for the caller to mess up which I'm not a big fan of (e.g. if the caller just passes context.Background()).

While I like the channel semantics here, another option is to implement a stateful iterator object that doesn't run inside a goroutine (though it'll be a bit more work, and we'd have to think about what happens if the dataset object changes under the hood in another Go routine, though that can be explicitly out of scope). When that iterator object doesn't have any more references, it'll be destroyed as usual. 

By stateful iterator I mean something like
```
iter := dicom.FlatIterator(dataset)
for iter.HasNext() {
    val := iter.NextValue()
}
```

I could envision a pretty straightforward implementation, even if the dataset ends up mutating in the middle of the FlatIterator (though if we want we can call that out). 

I think I will prototype a stateful iterator approach just to see, as I think it would be more difficult for the caller to accidentally use incorrectly vs the context approach. Let me know if you have any thoughts on this!

What if we kept a channel approach but wrapped it in a struct that satisfied `io.Closer`? So, we wouldn't have to implement a stateful iterator but 

```go
// Usage looks like
iter := dicom.FlatIterator()
defer iter.Close()
for element := range iter.chan {
    // ...
}
```

I suppose this is approximately similar to the creating a context and remembering to cancel it, though maybe a bit more explicit (and is similar to other patterns that use `io.Closer`). I'll check into this, but many linters and vet tools may even warn that Close() wasn't called if a user forgets it (not true in the context case if a user just passes context.Background() blindly). This is also a little more compact. I'll think on this a little and make some prototypes but let me know if you have a preference.

Implementing a Closer adds to the amount of bookkeeping the caller needs to keep track of, and will likely be confusing to a caller as we aren't really connecting to any sort of external resource, same with my suggestion of a context. 

Whereas with a stateful iterator you can just let it go out of scope and the garbage collector will do its thing as normal. It's also a familiar pattern, both the builtin sql lib and the mongoDB driver use the iterator approach for cursors, which to me indicates it's the more idiomatic approach.

Rather than implementing this as an iterator, we could just return a flattened slice of elements, so the signature is something
more akin to:

```go
func (d *Dataset) Flattened() []*Element {
    // implementation
}
```
Where all the elements are pre-collected for you. Because no io is involved, it's not clear to me that using a more complicated iterator approach will be so much more performant that it will really make a difference, especially weighed against the extra complexity. Maybe we start here, and add an iterator version at a later date?

It might be worth benching a simple approach like this against an iterator, which has its own overhead, to see if there are any worthwhile gains of using an iterator in the first place. I imagine most callers are going to want to inspect all elements on the happy path, so an iterator may only give a significant boost on error-paths, which will be less common, and therefore less important to optimize, anyway.",NA,https://api.github.com/repos/suyashkumar/dicom/issues/183/comments,https://github.com/suyashkumar/dicom/issues/183#issuecomment-797005519,https://api.github.com/repos/suyashkumar/dicom/issues/183

It's possible if the underlying data set changes that this flattened copy is out of sync. Luckily if any of the individual elements change its fine (as we're holding pointers), but not if elements are added or removed. Perhaps it should be common sense for the caller to watch out for situations like this (and perhaps those cases would be uncommon). 

in any case, a stateful iterator seems to be the most natural approach--doesn't suffer from the problem above, it's easily garbage collected, though the API is slightly more complex (e.g. can't just range over the return value sadly).

To unblock, perhaps I can go ahead and implement a simple stateful iterator that builds the Flattened() set of element pointers and then returns elements over it (as opposed to a possibly more complex implementation). If we wanted, we could consider exposing the underlying Flatten() operation as well with a note that it is a static snapshot of the Dataset. The iterator API could remain the same, but there are several future optimizations we could do--for example, don't recompute the flattened dataset if the underlying dataset hasn't changed (e.g. cache it), etc. But API wise, getting folks to use the iterator seems reasonable to me.

I think my main takeaway from this is that there are currently two main problems that make the API a little clumsy:

1) Toting around the Raw value, which in our context is probably not necessary, since end-users will need the raw value to create a helper value.

2) It would be better if we could eliminate the New... constructor functions, since it results in a very verbose function call.

I'll copy and paste the godoc exampled here to illustrate the API.

## Changes Overview

- Removed Raw fields. DICOM value strings are now generated on command
- New... constructor methods removed.
- WithNullSeparators() and WithoutNullSeparators() methods added for easy coercion to adding or removing all null separators when creating the Dicom value with .String()

## Examples

### Parse DICOM Value

```
// How to parse an existing PN value.
func ExampleParse() {
	// A Raw PN string value with Alphabetic, Ideographic, and Phonetic information.
	rawPN := ""Potter^Harry^James^^=哈利^波特^詹姆^^=hɛər.i^pɒ.tər^dʒeɪmz^^""

	// To parse a PN value, use personName.Parse
	parsedPN, err := personname.Parse(rawPN)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	// PN values are broken into three groups: Alphabetic, Phonetic, and Ideographic.
	// which can be accessed through getter methods.
	fmt.Println(""ALPHABETIC:"", parsedPN.Alphabetic.String())
	fmt.Println(""IDEOGRAPHIC:"", parsedPN.Ideographic.String())
	fmt.Println(""PHONETIC:"", parsedPN.Phonetic.String())

	// Each Group info in turn has Getter methods for retrieving individual data.
	fmt.Println(""FAMILY NAME:"", parsedPN.Alphabetic.FamilyName)
	fmt.Println(""GIVEN NAME: "", parsedPN.Alphabetic.GivenName)
	fmt.Println(""MIDDLE NAME:"", parsedPN.Alphabetic.MiddleName)
	fmt.Println(""NAME PREFIX:"", parsedPN.Alphabetic.NamePrefix)
	fmt.Println(""NAME SUFFIX:"", parsedPN.Alphabetic.NameSuffix)

	// To print the original Raw value, simply use the string method.
	fmt.Println(""ORIGINAL RAW:"", parsedPN.String())

	// Output (gotest comparison here is busted, maybe due to ideographs?):
	// ALPHABETIC: Potter^Harry^James^^
	// IDEOGRAPHIC: 哈利^波特^詹姆^^
	// PHONETIC: hɛər.i^pɒ.tər^dʒeɪmz^^
	// FAMILY NAME: Potter
	// GIVEN NAME:  Harry
	// MIDDLE NAME: James
	// NAME PREFIX:
	// NAME SUFFIX:
	// ORIGINAL RAW: Potter^Harry^James^^=哈利^波特^詹姆^^=hɛər.i^pɒ.tər^dʒeɪmz^^
}
```

### Create New PN

```
// How to create new PN value.
func ExampleNew() {
	// Create a new PN like so
	pnVal := personname.Info{
		Alphabetic: personname.GroupInfo{
			FamilyName: ""Potter"",
			GivenName:  ""Harry"",
			MiddleName: ""James"",
		},
		// Add empty group that will not render its separators.
		Ideographic: personname.GroupInfo{
			NoNullSeparators: true,
		},
		// Add empty group that will not render its separators.
		Phonetic: personname.GroupInfo{
			NoNullSeparators: true,
		},
		// This will remove trailing '=' separators
		NoNullSeparators: true,
	}

	// Print the string, should render as 'Potter^Harry^James^^'.
	fmt.Println(""PN 1:"", pnVal.String())

	// Now let's make one that still renders empty groups with String().
	pnVal = personname.Info{
		Alphabetic: personname.GroupInfo{
			FamilyName: ""Potter"",
			GivenName:  ""Harry"",
			MiddleName: ""James"",
		},
		// Add empty group that will render its separators.
		Ideographic: personname.GroupInfo{},
		// Add empty group that will render its separators.
		Phonetic: personname.GroupInfo{},
	}

	// This will render as 'Potter^Harry^James^^=^^^^=^^^^'
	fmt.Println(""PN 2:"", pnVal.String())

	// Output:
	// PN 1: Potter^Harry^James^^
	// PN 2: Potter^Harry^James^^=^^^^=^^^^
}
```

### Reformat

```
func ExampleInfo_WithNullSeparators() {
	rawVal := ""Potter^Harry""

	parsedPN, err := personname.Parse(rawVal)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	fmt.Println(""ORIGINAL   :"", parsedPN.String())

	reformatted := parsedPN.WithNullSeparators()
	fmt.Println(""REFORMATTED:"", reformatted.String())

	// Output:
	// ORIGINAL   : Potter^Harry
	// REFORMATTED: Potter^Harry^^^=^^^^=^^^^
}
```

```
func ExampleInfo_WithoutNullSeparators() {
	rawVal := ""Potter^Harry^^^=^^^^=^^^^""

	parsedPN, err := personname.Parse(rawVal)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	fmt.Println(""ORIGINAL   :"", parsedPN.String())

	reformatted := parsedPN.WithoutNullSeparators()
	fmt.Println(""REFORMATTED:"", reformatted.String())

	// Output:
	// ORIGINAL   : Potter^Harry^^^=^^^^=^^^^
	// REFORMATTED: Potter^Harry
}
```

## Open Questions

### Do we want .String() to return something more human-friendly?

I started out thinking this was a no-brainer good idea: the current .String() method could be turned into a DCM() method, and the string could return something easier to interpret at-a-glance.

The more I think about it, though, the less certain I become.

My first instinct would be:

'[NamePrefix] [FirstName] [MiddleName] [GivenName] [NameSuffix]'

But is that an Anglo-centric solution. I believe other cultures prefer to lead with the Family name, and am less certain on traditions surrounding titles (in Japanese, titles come after the name for instance). Further complicating things, I am unsure how other cultural conventions would map to the DICOM spec. Do Japanese hospitals use Mr. and Mrs.? Or do they use -San? Do they put that in the NamePrefix or NameSuffix field? The spec also specifically defined 'Given Name' instead of 'Last Name', which implies sensitivity that these fields need to support non-anglo names. Where should the Given Name be put, then?

Would using the above format result in something that borders nonsensical in certain non-English settings?

Humans are opinionated, and it's quite likely that there would be many, many divergent opinions on the best way to pretty-string this value, even in an English setting.

So where did I end up?

It is valid to say that these helper modules are here to implement the parsing of a value in accordance with the DICOM spec, and pretty-printing that value -- while tempting to include -- is outside that scope.

We may even want to define a DCM() and remove String() to side-step the whole problem and make clear we are not solving for it. Non-DICOM-compliant string representations can be left completely to the end user and their preferences.",NA,https://api.github.com/repos/suyashkumar/dicom/issues/167/comments,https://github.com/suyashkumar/dicom/pull/167#issuecomment-753757190,https://api.github.com/repos/suyashkumar/dicom/issues/167

`""Mr. John Bob Smith III [NamePrefix, GivenName, MiddleName, FamilyName, NameSuffix]""`

... could result in something like: 

`""Mr. John  Smith III [NamePrefix, GivenName, MiddleName, FamilyName, NameSuffix]""`,

Which makes it kind of hard to figure out which field is missing. We could also result in something like:

`""Mr. John Smith III [NamePrefix, GivenName, FamilyName, NameSuffix]""`

Where we remove the missing fields, but that also hides from the caller that there are fields missing. We could also do something like:

`""[NamePrefix='Mr.' GivenName='John' MiddleName='Bob' FamilyName='Smith' NameSuffix='III']""`

But at that point, we are kind of just implementing our own formatter '%+v' directive, which would spit out:

`{FamilyName:Potter GivenName:Harry MiddleName: NamePrefix: NameSuffix: NoNullSeparators:false}`

... and I'm left wondering if it just makes sense to leave calling '%+v' in fmt.Printf / Sprintf to the user for debugging.

It's worth noting that by implementing fmt.Stringer, you take away the ability for the caller to use %+v on the struct (both %v and %+v will return the result of the String() method). For a type like big.Rat -- which is modeling a singular value like a fraction -- where the individual fields are implementation details, this makes sense.

But at the end of the day the personname.GroupInfo type is just a container for a bunch of labeled data, and is exactly the type of value the built-in formatting directives are intended to support, so I don't know that we gain much by implementing our own String() even on the debugging front: The developer is just going to get a kind of unexpected result when using fmt.Printf(""%+v\n"", groupInfo).

Sorry to be making changes like this when we are close to a merge, but I think the API will be better for it.

Here's a quick summary of the updates:

### Changed 'NoNullSeparators' fields to 'TrailingNulls' fields

I tend to like having values be ""safe by default"", and when originally designing this API, I figured including null separators was the ""safer"" option than omitting them when rendering a PN value. Since the default bool value is false, that means the null separator field needed to be NoNullSeparators, where false means there *are* null separators.

However, I think having a double negative is semantically kind of annoying, and makes reasoning about formatting less intuitive than it could be, so I opted to change the field to TrailingNulls, where a true value means null separators were present / will be rendered. I've inverted all the values in the tests / examples. I think this makes the setting more scrutable and explicit, especially for passing arguments to the added WithFormat() method below.

Other method names have been altered to reflect this field name change.

### Added WithFormat() method

This method adds more granularity than the WithNullSeparators and WithoutNullSeparators methods do on their own. It can be used like so:

```
func ExampleInfo_WithFormat() {
	rawVal := ""Potter^Harry^^^=^^^^=^^^^""

	parsedPN, err := personname.Parse(rawVal)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	fmt.Println(""ORIGINAL   :"", parsedPN.DCM())

	reformatted := parsedPN.WithFormat(
		false, // groupTrailingNulls
		// We will keep empty separators for the Alphabetic group.
		true,  // alphabeticTrailingNulls
		false, // ideographicTrailingNulls
		false, // phoneticTrailingNulls
	)
	fmt.Println(""REFORMATTED:"", reformatted.DCM())

	// Output:
	// ORIGINAL   : Potter^Harry^^^=^^^^=^^^^
	// REFORMATTED: Potter^Harry^^^
}
```

### Added WithoutEmptyGroups() method

A formatting method that flips Info.TrailingNulls to false, and then examines each group, and if it has no actual information, sets its TrailingNulls setting to false. This is useful for rendering a PN value with all trailing nulls if there is _any_ information in a group, but eliding groups that have no information.

```
func ExampleInfo_WithoutEmptyGroups() {
	rawVal := ""Potter^Harry^^^=^^^^=^^^^""

	parsedPN, err := personname.Parse(rawVal)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	fmt.Println(""ORIGINAL   :"", parsedPN.DCM())

	reformatted := parsedPN.WithoutEmptyGroups()
	fmt.Println(""REFORMATTED:"", reformatted.DCM())

	// Output:
	// ORIGINAL   : Potter^Harry^^^=^^^^=^^^^
	// REFORMATTED: Potter^Harry^^^
}
```

### Edge case considerations

When going through your final notes, I realized there was an edge case I had not considered:

The value `""Potter^Harry^""` is technically a legal PN value. It has _some_ tailing nulls but not a full set of trailing nulls. Such a value cannot currently be round-tripped with the current implementation / API. The DCM() method would render back out
`""Potter^Harry^^^""`

My first instinct was that this is probably okay, as a non-full set of trailing nulls getting reformatted into a full set isn't so bad. But this passage of the DICOM spec, which specifies PN values for use in Veterinary settings has me reconsidering that stance:

Which leads me to believe that a PN value like:

`'PEAKE^NELLY==PEEK^'` might be a valid and useful representation, where the last group has a known pronunciation for the owner's last name, but not the pet's name, and such a value when round-tripped would get reformatted to `'PEAKE^NELLY==PEEK^^^'`. This could cause unexpected issues if a vet clinic were, say, updating a pet's name or something similar.

I know that is an ultra niche edge case, but I would like to do my best to FULLY capture the DICOM spec here, and I think maybe there should be some way to specify the LastNullSep value or something similar, so we can fully capture what is allowed by the DICOM spec, might be really useful. I think I am going to work on one final update to handle that, so you may want to hold off on a final final review until that is done.

I'm still going back and forth on whether separator level is actually part of the legal DICOM spec, it is not specifically addressed, stating simply:

> Trailing null components and their delimiters may be omitted.

But not clarifying whether trailing null components must ALL be omitted or retained. This latest update allows the round-tripping of a value like `""Potter^Harry^""`, and I think it's probably best to allow for that possibility, especially given the veterinary use case where `""Potter^""` makes some sense for a known animal owner, but an unknown animal name.

Still, let me know what you think. Rather than detailing the API changes here, I would say take a look at the code examples.

Here are the example PN values from the DICOM spec for your reference. It does not include an example like what I am accounting for here, but neither does it specifically exclude it:

Typically, why would a caller want to know if null separators were used? Would it sufficient to have a helper function just for that?

I'm not sure I had a hard reason for this beyond a philosophical one: I think, where possible, it's good to preserve all of the data inherent in an encoding, so that there is no information lost -- meaning you can fully recreate / re-encode your parsed data into the same serialized representation, as anything other behavior could be surprising to the caller, and as such result in a latent bug that goes undetected until you hit an edge case that might have downstream effects.

> Can you shed more light on why most callers would want this behavior? Is there some worry that writing the value back out without trailing null separators may cause a problem in the source system, even though it's conformant with the DICOM standard? 

One of the things I really like about pydicom is that when you get a value like a PersonName object, if you stick it back into another DICOM the original value will not be altered, even if it is non-compliant. They do that by carrying around the original string value in their value classes.

There are a LOT of legacy systems out there, some self-coded tools, etc, where certain assumptions may have been made about the way a value is formatted for that shop, where altering the way a value is represented in some other system might cause issues. In other words, system where the internal expectation is more strict than what the DICOM spec allows for. I've seen this be the case with all sorts of interchange formats in industry: proprietary tools make certain assumptions specific to an org, and if you don't preserve data exactly as-is when possible, your may cause issues for overly-fitted systems.

In an ideal world, that would not be an issue, but in the real world it often is. People abuse metadata fields all the time to 'encode' additional information.

Here's a couple theoretical examples I can think of off the top of my head:

**Querying a System**

Lets say we have a dicom with a weirdly formatted patient name we store in a db somewhere:

```
	// Let's say we have an element with an odd PN value
	element, err := dicom.NewElement(tag.PersonName, []string{""Potter^Harry^""})
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	// We then parse that value as a personname.Info
	pnRaw := element.Value.GetValue().([]string)[0]
	pnVal, err := personname.Parse(pnRaw)
	if err != nil {
		panic(pnRaw)
	}

	// Then we store it in a database somewhere
	recordId, err := storeInDB(pnVal)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
```

In our storage stage, we store the PN val in its component parts as parsed in personname.Info. Later on, we fetch that record, and reconstitute the value, then make a query to the PACS system for other images for patients of the same name (normally you would do this by patent ID, but you might know this patient has two different ID's or the like):

```
	recordId, err := storeInDB(pnVal)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	pnVal, err := getFromDB(recordId)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	
	resultList, err := queryPACSForName(tag.PatientName, pnVal.DCM())
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
```

If we don't fully capture the information contained in the PN value here, then it may lead to us querying for information with a value different from the original.

Or, what if we are batch-modifying a bunch of scans, while also logging our progress? We might read in a patient name formatted oddly, then write it to the new file, where we have been trying just to zap other fields by building a new Dataset without them, and after the fact notice that the formatting on all of our names has changed, causing problems somewhere else.

That being said, I DO agree that it might be simpler is better. Storing the discreet level of null separators is a little bit more overhead for creating new PN values, and because of the way enums are handled in go, pollutes the namespace a bit.

But, by fully capturing the data, it allows users to be able to use the structure as a round-trip data parser without having to worry about the serialized format being altered, something I generally think of as a bug from a decode / encode perspective, and that might be surprising behavior to the caller, which it is also important to avoid.

And again I keep falling back to: I would like to FULLY capture the encoding laid out in the dicom spec, and for better or worse the DICOM spec specifically allows for this truncation feature, so a FULL implementation of a PN constructor should have a way to set your preference.

The reason it is done as it is now is to preserve the clinical data in the PixelData (which often times map to actual measurements like Hounsfield units). This currently allows to caller to rescale as appropriate for their context.

For example, imagine a caller that is a image viewer. The user will input/change some value of window width and window center, that should be used in the rescaling formula that applies to the _original_ values in the pixel data, so could be applied directly to the image.Image as is today.

100% agree we should offer a default option for rescaling the pixel values based on the current values of various relevant tags (e.g. rescale intercept and slope, etc), but I think that should potentially be a set of utilities in a utility package (maybe `pkg/imgutil` or `pkg/frameutil`?) that helps with the rescaling. If the user applies a flag to the `dicomutil` utility, we can invoke some of this autoscaling. 

Also of course this currently applies to NativePixelData, though rescaling based on formulas and selections of window width and window center may also apply.

I am basically trying to generate a png from the pixel data. This worked for me for frames that 
are not encapsulated. 
```
nativeFrame := pixelDataInfo.Frames[0].NativeData
img := image.NewGray16(image.Rect(0, 0, nativeFrame.Cols, nativeFrame.Rows))

max := nativeFrame.Data[0][0]
min := nativeFrame.Data[0][0]
log.Printf(""Max. %d. Min %d\n"", max, min)

	if nativeFrame.Data[j][0] > max {
		max = nativeFrame.Data[j][0]
	}
	if nativeFrame.Data[j][0] < min {
		min = nativeFrame.Data[j][0]
	}

	img.SetGray16(j%nativeFrame.Cols, j/nativeFrame.Rows, color.Gray16{Y: uint16(0xFFFF * (float64(nativeFrame.Data[j][0]-min) / float64(max-min)))}) // for now, assume we're not overflowing uint16, assume gray image
}

for encapsulated frames, I tried to get the bytes and decode the image
```
if pixelDataInfo.Frames[0].IsEncapsulated() {
    img, _, err = image.Decode(bytes.NewReader(pixelDataInfo.Frames[0].EncapsulatedData.Data))
    if err != nil {
	    log.Printf(""Error encoding image. %s\n"", err.Error())
	    return err

and basically it said that it doesn't have the right format `Error encoding image. unsupported JPEG feature: unknown marker`
although I can see the image properly in Osirix viewer locally. (It is an MRI). Any thoughts on this? `jpeg.Decode` also didnt work.

At some point I may take this up myself and see if I can write a decoder in Go, but I'll have to see when I have time for that (and also if there's other interest outside the DICOM community to help drive that).  Note that other encapsulated images (non LJPEG) should be decoded just fine by this library!

As for supporting the various schemes of DICOM based rescaling of pixel values--I agree that this should be done (thus this issue and #2). For now, this library will at least help users get the raw data themselves (the value of which may be clinically meaningful) and rescale (or not) as appropriate in the case of Native PixelData.

We can also read in the bytes and do nothing with unpacking them until a user wants the image.Image, which is _almost_ what we do today. I'm leaning towards something similar to current behavior + an option to not read PixelData (or any blocklist of tags potentially). We also already have a ""streaming"" option where frames can be consumed by a consumer as they are parsed, instead of having to wait for the full set of frames (or the whole dicom) to be parsed.

Note that there will be a larger apparent percent latency reduction for files with more frames or larger frames (don't have such examples in `testdata/` yet, so it's not as apparent in the benchmarks above).

Similar to your implementation, this change removes an unnecessary slice allocation in the loop. In this implementation, two slices are allocated per frame in advance of parsing the frame. In your implementation, I see you read the data into a single dimension slice until the user wants to unpack it (where the rest of the work is done). This is something I considered myself, however I was able to achieve similar results without changing the API surface (in the struct) in this change so I prefer that until the next minor release with api breaking changes. The reason for this is because slicing a golang slice doesn't lead to copying (though there is still some minor overhead).

One of the things I see in your implementation is replacing the calls to `binary.Read`, which seems very interesting and useful--I didn't know it allocated a slice under the hood!

Would you be able to run the benchmarks on your fork so we can see how they look? And/or, would you be willing to open a PR here with the uint read changes to move away from `binary.Read` (but we can keep the slice structure the same for now)? If you open a PR, it will automatically run the benchmarks as a GitHub action and compare to baseline. Alternatively, I can make a change to that effect and add you as a co-author.

I will probably go ahead and merge this change to separate it from the others (there are some others I'd like to make too).

Thanks for the suggestion, I think it's a good idea to help folks work with native Go dates and durations.

I'd like to think a little about where this should live. I'm wondering if maybe this should be inside a utility subpackage (something like `pkg/dcmtime`) since the top level library API is already becoming somewhat complicated, and I'd like to simplify. Also, this logic may be useful for folks working with dicom date strings that may not come directly out of a dicom (e.g. maybe from some third party place like Google cloud dicom store). 

The other option is to treat Date Strings as special ValueTypes during parsing, and parse them directly into native Go containers. Because without generics this is a little cumbersome, I'm somewhat partial to maybe avoiding too many additional ValueTypes if possible.

I'm leaning towards a `dcmtime` package with a different API, perhaps something like:

```go
// FromDateString converts a DICOM date string (from VR=DT or VR=DA) to a Go time.Time.
FromDateString(dateStr string) (time.Time, error)

// FromAgeString ...
FromAgeString(ageStr string) (time.Duration, error)

The latter is used, for example, by all medical imaging devices (modalities), PACs, viewers, analysis consoles, etc. to communicate with each other.

The WEB version (DICOMWeb / WADO) has been emerging for a few years mainly for Web usage (as its name indicates), but 99% of medical data exchanges still use the old DICOM UL protocol.

Today, mainly two Open source libraries implement it: DCMTK (C++) and DCM4CHE (Java). 
They are both of a certain age (20 years old for DCM4CHE, 24 years old for DCMTK), their maintenance and documentation is becoming more and more difficult, and I think there is room for a new generation of OpenSource libraries covering the entire standard.

It would allow the emergence of a new generation of medical software, more modern, more secure, more ""Cloud native"" and the Go language is perfect for that.

With the advent of digitized patient records, AI, graph oriented databases, and access to healthcare for the largest number of people, it may be time to dust off the DICOM environment.

Indeed you are correct that at some point we need to support for creating elements, mostly to support testing downstream (and a `write` package, which hasn't materialized yet in the rewrite). I'd say right now the alpha is mostly ready to test for data parsing, but some of these other use cases still need to be built out.

This is something I've been thinking about recently--I think I'd like to keep all of the Value implementations and their members private (e.g. I recently sent a PR to make the Value implementations private: #103), hopefully there's no reason that you as a Caller need to know about the details of the Value implementation. This keeps the dicom namespace less crowded, and you as a user just need to focus on the public API of the Value (and I'll have more examples on how to work with it). I'm not 100% sure if I like this yet or not, but would love to hear your thoughts as well!

What I will probably do to address your use case is to have an exported function like:

```go
// NewValue creates a new DICOM value for the supplied data. 
// Data must be one of the following types, otherwise and error will be returned.
// Acceptable types: []int, []string, []*Element, PixelDataInfo, ...
func NewValue(data interface{}) (Value, error)
```

And probably an accompanying `func NewElement(tag tag.Tag, vr string, vl int, data interface{}) (*Element, error)`

I haven't done much with the write package since inheriting from the upstream fork (by contrast much of the read package is [being rewritten](https://github.com/suyashkumar/dicom/tree/s/1.0-rewrite), and the write package should be too at some point imo). 

This is happening because right now only one VR is read in from the dicom standard into the tag map: https://github.com/suyashkumar/dicom/blob/9d8d8d93103033c11b791381ffe54559ce4c7429/dicomtag/tag_definitions.go#L3369

Likely after some rewrites we should ingest multiple possible values for the padding.

For now, one option is to skip the VR verification during writing: https://github.com/suyashkumar/dicom/blob/9d8d8d93103033c11b791381ffe54559ce4c7429/write/writer.go#L22

It seems that this fix partially works. For files that are broken in the missing 'DICM' keyword, it appears that we can now read the data contained in them (as tested with the files I have available, see [issue 59](https://github.com/suyashkumar/dicom/issues/59), comparing it to fields outputted by dcmtk and pydicom).

However, when attempting to read files that aren't broken in this way, the program is unable to parse the file and gives an errors in the format of those in [issue 63](https://github.com/suyashkumar/dicom/issues/63) (e.g. `ERROR Trying to read 66096 bytes beyond buffer end (file offset 146) 51-103.dcm`

I haven't had a chance to look into this error yet to see if it's easily fixable, but if not, I suspect that we could pretty easily implement a check to call `NewParser()` if 'DICM' is at byte 128 even if the force flag is set to true. That way, if [issue 63](https://github.com/suyashkumar/dicom/issues/63) is a pain to fix, we can worry about fixing it later and still get this feature out.

Added some inline comments. In general, it's possible the issue you're getting is due to the default choice of transfer syntax as mentioned, but most likely it's due to garbage being present in the first 128 bytes + 4 bytes that the parser is attempting to parse as valid tags--this could cause some alignment issues with the actual data downstream.

> One semi-hacky way to avoid this is to discard any tag that doesn't look like a tag while in forced mode. I don't really like this though. I'll think on it some more in the morning to see if we can come up with a more graceful solution here. Maybe having it be a clear part of the API (maybe by renaming it to NewParserWithoutMetadata or something) would make the current behavior okay, but I don't like it very much just yet.

Thanks for all the feedback! 

Have you had a chance to think more about a better way of solving this issue? The only additional way I was able to come up with is very hacky and is to create a temporary parser within the `NewParserForce()` function and parse the file header as if the file were valid, then if `temp_parser.parsedElements` contains valid elements, set actual `p.parsedElements` to contain them and set `p.decoder` to where `temp_parser` left off. And for safety, `temp_parser` would end if it receives a tag after `(0002,0102)`, which is the last possible tag in the header, or if MetaElementGroupLength is defined in the file, or if the position of `temp_parser.decoder` exceeds the maximum possible length of the file header. And if `temp_parser` failed to get any useful information, it would be assumed that the file is missing a header and thus could be read by just skipping the header and using default transfer syntax.

Reminding myself of the issue here it seems like when trying to pass ""correct"" DICOMs through the parser with force enabled, it fails--which is not surprising, because this implementation doesn't skip over the 128+4, and so the parser offset is incorrect.

However, with the force disabled everything works as expected.

@IChocked is this a correct summary of the issue?

Maybe this could be considered a feature and not a bug, as sorta mentioned above maybe we should rename this `NewParserAssumeNoPreamble` or something to indicate this creates a parser that will _only_ work on DICMs with no preamble (128+4bytes), and that it will __not function correctly__ and have undefined behavior for DICMs that _do_ have the preamble.

I'm not a huge fan of this approach, but I think it will solve your problem. I can write a version of this for 1.0 that takes in an option instead to `AssumeNoPreamble()`.

Another option is to be more intelligent about this, so that we can intelligently ""fall back"" to this behavior, but I think this is sufficient if it will unblock y'all for now. You will have to write logic in the calling program to try to parse the dicom normally, and if it fails, then attempt with the force option.

Looks like this issue is coming from the jpeg.Decode call (from [here](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/c5ac91d0e1082914d3eeb8dff9d80974eb1bf9b7/src/image/jpeg/reader.go#L647)). One option is to take the encapsulated pixel byte data and write out the byte data to disk to see if you can open it in a jpeg tool of your choice. Taking a look, there does seem to be data in the `EncapsulatedFrame`.

You'd want to try something like 

```go
fr, err := slice.pixelData.Frames[0].GetEncapsulatedFrame()
fmt.Println(fr.Data)
f, _ := os.Create(""test.jpg"")
f.Write(fr.Data)
f.Close()
```
to get the underlying data, which appears to indeed be parsed into the construct. That could be a good place to start the debug--is the data encoded in an odd way, perhaps using some of the newer JPEG codecs that maybe aren't supported by the Go stdlib? 

At the very least, you should have access to the byte data to then try to render or process downstream. I think if this is an issue with the JPEG codecs, it might be good to pull in a third part library to help decode some of this jpeg data.

I'm able to get the byte data from the encapsulated frame using the code above. The issue is the JPEG encoding.

The encoding of the images is **JPEG Lossless:Non-hierarchical, 1stOrderPrediction** (1.2.840.10008.1.2.4.70)

After looking into this a bit, there doesn't seem to be an easy way to parse these. Apparently, [very few image readers support this codec](https://stackoverflow.com/a/37399895/5781184), which coincidentally [you noted back in 2018](https://github.com/gradienthealth/dicom/issues/24#issuecomment-408145964) 😜 . The std lib `image/jpeg` still [does not support it](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/22535) either.

Have you come across any way to parse these since? I've read that `cgo` might be able to run a [C dicom library that can handle the codec](https://stackoverflow.com/a/38496553/5781184), but that's obviously not ideal.",NA,https://api.github.com/repos/suyashkumar/dicom/issues/85/comments,https://github.com/suyashkumar/dicom/issues/85#issuecomment-663053607,https://api.github.com/repos/suyashkumar/dicom/issues/85

Great find, btw--I do remember thinking a little about this in the [past as you found](https://github.com/gradienthealth/dicom/issues/24#issuecomment-408145964), but luckily never directly ran into this situation yet 😅 .

I haven't looked into how complicated the implementation of LosslessJEPG might be, but for what it's worth it might be a pretty decent contribution to the Go stdlib, but unclear how common it is in the wild (particularly outside of DICOM). I too haven't found a lot of support or implementations of it yet. 

A quick search found [this JS library](https://github.com/rii-mango/JPEGLosslessDecoderJS) that appears to implement lossless jpeg. Might be worth trying to port this over into Go.

In the short term to unblock your usecase, it may not be terrible to have a secondary stage of processing where you can run the JPEG-LS bytes through another parser (like this Javascript one, or a C++ one, even if it's not directly part of the same go program). If you're doing batch processing, you can probably spin up a docker container with a shell script that runs your go program (which can write the JEPG bytes to a file) and then invokes a JS or C++ program to decode the JPEG and save it out into some other lossless format for the rest of your pipeline.

Is it important that your code be encapsulated into a single go program, or are you working with a non-batch use case (e.g. a server)?

For the time being, we've decided to hold off on any development to solve this issue. We're hoping to gather more scans from customers and find out that this encoding is extremely rare - rare enough that we can simply specify in our CT specifications that we don't accept this encoding.

However, if we are alienating a significant number of scans, we will probably have to solve this. I think porting over the JPEGLosslessDecoderJS library you linked to would be the way to go in that case.

It looks like the PixelData tag `(7FE0,0010)` can appear multiple times in a Dataset, in particular when it is part of an Icon Image Sequence.

In this case, when we parse that native pixel data, we must make use of tags that have appeared earlier (like `Rows`, `BitsAllocated`, etc). However, if we encounter the PixelData tag within an Icon Image Sequence, we need to fetch these tags from within the current sequence instead of from the global dataset. If we fetch them from the global dataset, we end up grabbing the values for the actual PixelData and not the icon!

Will look into a mitigation for this shortly. Will also keep this in mind for the rewrite. This only seems to be an issue for the native pixel data, which AFAIK is the main thing that requires looking back at the dataset to parse (encapsulated pixel data does not require ""looking back"").

Since we support parsing data as it arrives (and emitting frames as they are parsed, even if we haven't read the whole dicom into memory) it would be good to preserve that behavior.

I think we should certainly close the file if NewParserFromFile returned with an error though! 

Also, perhaps it's worth not adding this in the 1.0 API, and simply leaving the [io.Reader interface](https://github.com/suyashkumar/dicom/blob/s/1.0-rewrite/parse.go), forcing the caller to manage the source of the data (files, closing them, etc).

Though it's not the worst for the caller to do something like:
```go
p, err := dicom.NewParserFromFile(...)
if err != nil {
  // handle
}
defer p.Finish()  // caller may want to handle this error as well
```

The main reason this is in there is to support the ParseNext API, but I agree it's a little clunky to be managing the file on our end.

Since Parse already calls p.Finish, to adhere cleanly to the pattern above we may need to put some guards in place in case p.Finish is called multiple times (haven't looked too closely at this).

Option 2 likely sounds the best, though I'm not sure if the diversity of DICOMs in the cancer imaging archive match what you likely have--hopefully some of these issues are reproducible there! 

For dicoms like this, perhaps I should add additional debug instrumentation that can output information about which element the parser was in when it encountered the error, and other contextual information helpful for debug. Of course, we can always through a couple debug logs in there for the purposes of investigating this further. 

One thought that came to mind is that some underlying `io` package methods can return [`ErrUnexpectedEOF`](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/6a569f243e028f823a9f20bfd9da7bdfab8699a4/src/io/io.go#L40-L42), assuming this is the exact error you are getting. 
Seems like this is returned when some logic is trying to read N bytes, but encounters an EOF before fully reading N bytes.

Great to hear you all are using the library extensively! I'd love to build an extensive test library of DICOMs to periodically test against--I don't doubt that there are DICOMs out there that will trip up this parser (and others), given the extreme variability and non-standard quirks found in DICOMs. Either way, that will be a great way to triage additional features to build to address various quirks that exist out there.

I think this would also be a great canonical set of dicoms to test any library against once put together (I haven't been able to find  a good test set, just a couple small collections here and there).

I'll need to look a little closer at the test failure on your branch to help debug. 

In terms of the general approach, off the top of my head I think it might be sufficient to read until the first non group `0x0002` group tag and then proceeding with typical parsing after that. I'll have to double check though if we need to enforce that certain metadata tags be present. To make the interface a little less hacky, we can have `parseFileHeader` return two `[]*element.Element` slices--one containing the metadata tags, and one containing the extra element we read, to start off the elements to be read downstream. It'll still be a little hacky, but maybe an okay place to start.

Will need to double check that there isn't anything else special we need to consider when reading that extra non-metadata tag (I *think* it should be okay, but we need to look up and see if metadata tags have any interaction with reading some of the downstream non-metadata tags and how we might want to deal with it if so)",NA,https://api.github.com/repos/suyashkumar/dicom/issues/53/comments,https://github.com/suyashkumar/dicom/issues/53#issuecomment-633161494,https://api.github.com/repos/suyashkumar/dicom/issues/53

Yep, so in dicom there are two broad types of image data: Encapsulated images (compressed in some way) and Native images (which are usually stored in the dicom as 16 bit ints). You can see how native pixel data is turned into a jpg [here](https://github.com/suyashkumar/dicom/blob/master/dicomutil/dicomutil.go#L137) (autoscaling will need to be implemented at some point) and you can see how it's parsed out of the dicom [here](https://github.com/suyashkumar/dicom/blob/master/parse.go#L521). 

Thing with encapsulated data is that it can be encoded using one of many formats (JPEG-2000, JPEG-LS, MPEG, etc), though usually it's some type of JPG. Check out more here: http://dicom.nema.org/dicom/2013/output/chtml/part05/sect_8.2.html 

Right now the `dicomutil` assumes the data is some sort of jpeg and writes the binary image data out to disk with a `.jpg` file name as you see here: https://github.com/suyashkumar/dicom/blob/master/dicomutil/dicomutil.go#L132 .",NA,https://api.github.com/repos/suyashkumar/dicom/issues/8/comments,https://github.com/suyashkumar/dicom/issues/8#issuecomment-493307509,https://api.github.com/repos/suyashkumar/dicom/issues/8

I have a few usecases in mind:

Animated DICOM. So if i get a Dicom of from an Ultrasound machine then we are talking either a still or animated right ?
I want to be able to play it animated and so suck out the images and then transcode to the Viewers video format.

3D Printing. So if i am making a prosthetic and want a perfect fit then i want to get a DICOM CT scan, suck out the data and turn into a 3D point cloud and then 3d mesh and then put it into a 3D viewer.
But also from the point cloud i can convert it to a mesh and 3 print the implant.

We try to keep this API up-to-date, although right now we're a bit behind release schedule. As for breaking changes, when the Riot Api does a major versioning step (like most recently from v3 to v4) there are some breaking changes to be expected (just because the Riot Api works a bit different now). Changes like that are usually communicated by Riot approx. 90 days before enforcing it to give users time to migrate their project to the latest version.

@Renkon 
I'm currently in a testing stage with the current master branch -- and so far it seems stable. If you need it to work right now, I'd highly suggest to use the current master branch. But if no major issue comes up, I'll try to get a new release out this week.

So the [getChampionById](https://developer.riotgames.com/api-methods/#lol-static-data-v3/GET_getChampionById) Riot Games API endpoint that backs the method you are calling doesn't return all data by default. The default response will only contain the champions name, title, id, and key.

You are currently using the method that asks for the default response:

```java
getDataChampion(Platform platform, int id);
```

To ask for more information than this, you will have to use the overloaded method, and provide additional 'tags' for the kind of data you wish to receive.

```java
 getDataChampion(Platform platform, int id, Locale locale, String version, ChampionTags... tags);
```

So your updated code might look something like this:

```java
Champion champion = api.getDataChampion(Platform.EUW, ID, null, null,
                ChampionTags.STATS, ChampionTags.PASSIVE, ChampionTags.LORE, ChampionTags.SKINS);
```

Alternatively, if you don't care too much about controlling the payload size of the response from the API, you can just provide `ChampionTags.ALL` as a tag to get all the possible champion data.

```java
Champion champion = api.getDataChampion(Platform.EUW, ID, null, null, ChampionTags.ALL);
```

To answer your second question, it is totally possible to create a program that looks up champion information by champion name.

You will still be querying for champion data using the champion's ID (as that is the unique identifier for the champion that the endpoint for the Riot Games API expects you to provide), however the trick it to make a request for all champion data and cache this data before the user asks you for a specific champion's data.

The Riot Games API provides a great endpoint to retrieve data for all champions in the game. The method for this endpoint is called `getDataChampionList`:

```java
ChampionList championList = api.getDataChampionList(Platform.EUW, null, null, false, ChampionListTags.ALL);
```

Unfortunately, the data is organized as a mapping from champion `key` to champion data objects, and keys aren't always the champion's name (i.e. Wukong's key is MonkeyKing). So, if you want to cache this data in a way that makes it easy to retrieve champion data by their name in a scalable way, you will have to get a bit fancy and use your own data structure as a cache rather than just using the map directly from the response.

Here's a simple example:

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.Scanner;
import net.rithms.riot.api.ApiConfig;
import net.rithms.riot.api.RiotApi;
import net.rithms.riot.api.RiotApiException;
import net.rithms.riot.api.endpoints.static_data.constant.ChampionListTags;
import net.rithms.riot.api.endpoints.static_data.dto.Champion;
import net.rithms.riot.api.endpoints.static_data.dto.ChampionList;
import net.rithms.riot.constant.Platform;

public class GetDataChampionExample {

    private static Scanner scanner;

    public static void main(String[] args) throws RiotApiException {
        ApiConfig config = new ApiConfig().setKey(""key"");
        RiotApi api = new RiotApi(config);

        ChampionList championList = api.getDataChampionList(Platform.EUW, null, null, false, ChampionListTags.ALL);
        Map<String, Champion> championByName = new HashMap<>();
        for (Champion champion : championList.getData().values()) {
            championByName.put(champion.getName().toLowerCase(), champion);
        }

        scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print(""What champion would you like data for?"");
        String name = scanner.next().toLowerCase();
        Champion champion = championByName.get(name);
        if (champion != null) {
            System.out.println(""ID: "" + champion.getId());
            System.out.println(""Name: "" + champion.getName());
            System.out.println(""Stats: "" + champion.getStats());
            System.out.println(""Passive: "" + champion.getPassive());
            System.out.println(""Lore: "" + champion.getLore());
            System.out.println(""Title: "" + champion.getTitle());
            System.out.println(""Skins: "" + champion.getSkins());
        } else {
            System.out.println(""Sorry I don't recognize that champion name."");
        }
    }
}
```

Note, you will have to fix your print statements as most of the toString() methods will just print out the raw data representation of the object, not a pretty formatted string if that is what you are looking for.

So basically if you already got a 429 response from the Riot Api, it will try to respect the Retry-After header for the given service, method or app.

There is also a BufferedRateLimitHandler in the current version of this library that, when configured properly, will try to prevent 429 responses by stopping to fire new requests early. Basically what it does is after a request it reads the rate limit headers from the Riot Api's response, and if the current usage is above X%, it will issue a manual X second cooldown on making requests to the given endpoint(s).

In a later version we also want to provide an AtomicRateLimitHandler (currently WIP) that tries to properly keep track of your rate limits by counting the requests you make and stopping a request when it would exceed the rate limit.

You can also write your own rate limiting logic by implementing the RateLimitHandler interface or extending the DefaultRateLimitHandler class. To use a non-default RateLimitHandler, use the #setRateLimitHandler() method of your ApiConfig.

For my personal use I created a custom RedisRateLimitHandler that basically uses a dedicated redis server to atomically manage rate limits for multiple dedicated servers using the same api key. This library is designed to give you a lot of freedom to create a RateLimitHandler that suits your specific use case best.


In any case, regardless of if the Riot Api throws a 'real' RateLimitException or if the RateLimitHandler of your choice prevents making a call (in which case it will throw a RespectedRateLimitException, which inherits RateLimitException), your request will fail and you will not get a response from it. What you can do is catch RateLimitException when you do a request. On that RateLimitException object you can call #getRetryAfter() which will give you an integer that is the amount of seconds you need to wait before you can fire the request again.

I believe some regions (like Turkey) have allowed characters outside the regex given by Riot. Also given the fact that the set of allowed characters for each region (or even new regions in future) could change without notice, this is a pretty unmaintainable solution.

I think the discussion I had about it in discord ended up suggesting to only check if all characters are valid UTF-8 characters, since everything else is pretty unnecessary and unmaintainable, or simply only filter out empty strings.

That being said, even with the current implementation of only checking for empty strings, and allowing user input for summoner names, I don't hit any 400 responses anymore and only a very tiny amount of 404 responses (which ultimately are caused by searching non-existing summoners with legit characters).

So like I said, I'm highly uncomfortable with checking summoner names using regex because sooner or later this would cause unnecessary trouble.


Just for the sake of completeness, these are the *currently* allowed characters for each region: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752814-Summoner-Name-FAQ#h1q5 -- So if you were to really tryhard, you would even have to specify this validation function *per platform*, and limit it to those characters only. At this point you should probably see how stupid and unmaintainable things would get. Also there is no guarantee that this article will always be up-to-date (or even is up-to-date right now).

One more addendum: Just to show an example on how quick these character sets could change, a few months ago the German language (within the EUW region) recently officially created a capitalized version of the letter ß (ẞ). Prior to that there only was the uncapitalized version. (Basically this is because words never start with ß, so there was no need for a capitalized version of that letter. But there came up some trouble in the age of technology when people with a ""ß"" in their name got their name capitalized in some documents, which, as per grammar rules, would turn ""ß"" into ""SS"" and therefor technically putting a wrong name in their documents. If you care about this little off-topic story, you could continue reading here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_%E1%BA%9E) So, while ẞ is not listed as legit character for EUW, it might soon become one.",NA,https://api.github.com/repos/taycaldwell/riot-api-java/issues/120/comments,https://github.com/taycaldwell/riot-api-java/pull/120#issuecomment-334944381,https://api.github.com/repos/taycaldwell/riot-api-java/issues/120

If you want more data than is provided by default you will need to provide a tag using the overloaded method:

`getDataItemList(Platform platform, Locale locale, String version, ItemListTags... tags)`

In your case you will want to provide ItemListTags.GOLD and ItemListTags.IMAGE or simply ItemListTags.ALL.

If we wanted to cache API calls, there are alot of open questions. Probably the biggest of all would be:

**Where to cache data?**
You could cache data in memory, but that would quickly become an enormous memory eater. Just take the matches endpoint for example, I just picked a random match from the Api and get a result that is 32261 characters in size, which approximately equals ~32 KB, assuming you cache the json String. If you were to cache the actual DTOs, it would probably be much bigger. It's not unusual that projects request hundreds of thousands or even millions of matches to calculate averages for certain things -- that would quickly sum up many GB of cache and end up in a java.lang.OutOfMemoryError and crash the application on many low-tier servers. Of course you could provide options to limit the cache size or allow uncached calls to go around this.
Alternatively you could store the cache on disk, maybe create a ""cache"" folder and store files there for each cached call. The big advantage is that your memory keeps clean and your cache survives a restart of the application. The downsides are that this would slow down the server, if it has to open and close files constantly. Also depending on your system, you might eventually run into ""Too many open files"" errors.
You could also cache your calls in third party databases or third party caching tools like memcached -- and if your project gets too big to run on a single dedicated server you eventually have to use a dedicated caching option, since local caching kinda gets pointless when running multiple instances. Each option has their advantages and disadvantages -- so what would we choose to provide with this api wrapper? Basically there is no general right or wrong, it simply depends on the specific use case of the developers using this api wrapper.


I personally belong to the latter category -- I have projects too big to be run on a single dedicated server, so a local cache is not really going to help my use case. Instead I use a memcached server for short-term caching and a few mariadb database servers for long-term caching.

There are many projects dedicated to caching data for tons of different use cases. I think every developer should decide on their own what caching method suits their needs. I personally don't believe there is *the one* caching method that's right for everyone, so I think it would be wrong to force one caching method upon everyone using this api wrapper. Also with the many caching options already being offered by other dedicated projects, it would kinda be like reinventing the wheel.


What are your thoughts on this?",NA,https://api.github.com/repos/taycaldwell/riot-api-java/issues/98/comments,https://github.com/taycaldwell/riot-api-java/issues/98#issuecomment-300427996,https://api.github.com/repos/taycaldwell/riot-api-java/issues/98

Instead of storing all the objects you need after calling once the Riot API, you just repeatedly call getSummonerByName for example. Then in your code there would be much less variables. Also, since my project is currently just a naive way to cache data, I can't really talk about memory efficiency. I could easily add in a cache size limit, since we know the average size of all the DTOs, and I just have to limit the map sizes for each DTO type.

I'm more for offering easier options for developers than forcing them to use something. People can use both cached and uncached methods.

Caching on disk would be a bit overkill in my opinion, as the rate limit imposed by Riot are not that limiting, especially for the application APIs. Maybe it would be somewhat useful for the developer API limit, but I still don't really see a use for it, a limited memory cache would be the best way to go in my opinion, as those who request millions of matches can figure a way to cache their own information (eg. cache the win ratio and use it to recalculate using only new matches instead of going through the list again).

I'm wondering if we should utilize Optionals for return values to enforce devs to check if data #isPresent before they handle it. Thoughts @Linnun?

`Optional<List<League>>` seems nasty, but if the API is going to return empty data rather than a 404, we should probably handle it more elegantly (Would prefer an empty collection). Other option is to explicitly handle these kind of endpoint quirks (i.e. throw a 404 for this case.).

Also need to look into this more and see why GSON wouldn't just convert it to an empty list, since I'm pretty sure the API is returning an empty JSON array as a response.

So the reason you are getting an empty console is because the `leagues` list is `null`, so the print statements are never executed and printed to the console.

The reason is that leagues are not mapped to Queues 1:1. There might be multiple queues that count towards the same league. For example the queues RANKED_SOLO_5x5 and TEAM_BUILDER_RANKED_SOLO both had their games count towards the RANKED_SOLO_5x5 league. Also the name of a league does not have to match the name of any queue at all -- note that *theoretically* Riot could change this in future on short notice.

That being said, you should **always** check the result from an api call for `null`, at least when getting a non-Collection. For Collections, it is admittingly bad practice to have them return as `null` -- they should return empty Collcetions instead. That is something I will look into for the upcoming version 4.0.0 of this api wrapper.

As for your code, other than missing the `null` check it looks fine.

Having to pass in `participantID-1` is understandable, as you're dealing with indices of a list, not keys and values. However, I do think having a utility method to easily grab participants by their ID is a good suggestion and a more correct way of retrieving the participant data, as there's nothing guaranteeing that the indices of the participants will always be equal to `particpantID-1`. `1` in this case just seems like some magic number bullshit that could change tomorrow if Riot updates participant IDs to be something other than `1-10`.

I have sent in an application for access to the tournament endpoints so we can properly test the methods when we update the library.

I believe the documentation for these endpoints is publicly visible if you are logged out of your dev portal account, however when you sign in it is hidden unless you have access. I still however, would like to get a key for purposes of further developing this library.

Please open a new issue for questions unrelated to this specific issue.

To answer your question, ""API-KEY-HERE"" is a placeholder string that you need to replace with your development API key. A development API key is a unique string generated for you that allows you to make calls to the Riot Games API. To get a key, you will need to register a developer account on the Riot Games API developer portal.

The string ""tryndamere"" is an example user name for a player in the game. The user name for a player is also known as a ""summoner name"".

If you have anymore questions. Feel free to reach out to me by email, or open separate issue.

A lot of the underlying services that power the API are owned by different teams across Riot. In the past that has been their explanation for little type and naming inconsistencies across endpoints like this.

IIRC, in the past we addressed this to make the library more consistent, but I guess we overlooked these specific endpoints. (or maybe a thread was made to ask Riot why this inconsistency exists, but we never really did anything about it on our end? idr.)

Either way, its a simple change. The GSON conversion should still work if we change the champion ID type to int instead of long in the necessary DTOs.

This leaves open the following questions:

1.) Which fields should be included/excluded for each DTO? Will all fields be included, or just fields deemed ""important"".
2.) What format should the information be printed in? (a list of values with no context, JSON, a line by line list of the field names and their values, etc.)

IMO a toString method should be a String representation of the object, but you mention using it to display only key information.

For example, when it comes to a toString() method for a League entry of a summoner, what is the expected output? Some may expect the output to be the JSON returned from the API, some may expect just the Tier of the summoner, some may expect Tier and Division, some may expect Tier, Division, League name, LP, etc.

If the method output doesn't match majority of developer expectations, they will just end up using the individual accessors for key information anyways, making the toString method useless.

I received an email a while ago from someone asking how to get the name of a summoner because the toString() method wasn't working. I had to advise him to use the getName() method instead. This is an example of someone who would have different expectations than me.

IMO, if I were using a toString() method on a data object from this library, I would expect a JSON String with all the data returned by the Riot API. I don't understand why I would ever use that, but having a toString() method for objects would make the library more complete.

TL;DR: I'm down with having toString() methods, I'm just interested in hearing your opinion (and anyone elses) to the questions listed above.

1. Only important field should be included. It would be then a matter of perspective to decide what is ""important"". But I'd say that the `toString()` method can be useful when logging and debugging your applications. You simply want to log your object to have some trace of it, and instead of having a useless memory pointer, you'd have some information.
   The minimum ""useful"" information would be the technical id (of champion, league, etc.). Like I said, it's a matter of perspective and for a Summoner I'd put `(Id, Name)`.
2. No JSON format, as I think it's not the idea behind the Java toString() method. I like this notation : (val1; val2; val3), or (key1:val1; key2:val2; ...). JSON encoding should be delegate to transformation libraries that serializes DataObjects to JSON/XML formats.

If a developer want to access specific information, of course that he should use getters methods to retrieve it, and not toString(). It's just a matter of not being disappointed when you put your objects in some log and have nothing practical to use... ;)

1. Either make it minimalistic and only use some sort of 'primary keys' (for summoners this would be ID and name, for matches this would be the matchID, etc.)
2. Or make it complete and plot all fields. In some other projects I have toString() methods on some objects that print out every single field, much like this:

```
UserObject {
    id: 1337
    name: asd
    level: 1
}
```

It's not exactly JSON, but very easy to read and get information from when you're debugging. I think I would prefer the second way for the following reason: You are only ever going to print a data object when you're debugging, and more information is always good when debugging.

Example:

ChampionList contains a List<Champion>. Since List does not have a toString(boolean verbose) method, it will use the default toString() method of List, causing it to call the parameter-less toString() method of its items; so verbosity is not passed on to the Champion elements of the list.

While this is reasonably okay-ish for verbosity (you could say we don't want verbosity on each single list item), I also tried to pass on a `int depth` parameter, so that we would have some indentation to make it look pretty.

Outside of the issues you would run into with persistence and DAOs, there aren't too many reasons for these objects to have setter methods, which is why they don't have them now.

For example, the champion endpoint will only return basic information such as champion name, key, id and title.

When you use the overloaded method **getDataChampionList(Region)** without the ChampData parameter, you will just get this default information, and everything else will be 0-false-null.

If you want information like image, skin, or lore data, you will have to use **getDataChampionList(locale, version, dataById, champData)**, providing the kind of ChampData you want to the champData parameter.

Here is an example, printing out all the skin names of each champion:

``` java
import net.rithms.riot.api.RiotApi;
import net.rithms.riot.api.RiotApiException;
import net.rithms.riot.constant.Region;
import net.rithms.riot.constant.staticdata.ChampData;
import net.rithms.riot.dto.Static.Champion;

    public static void main(String[] args) throws RiotApiException {
        // TODO Auto-generated method stub
        RiotApi api = new RiotApi(""API-KEY"", Region.NA);

Note you can provide multiple ChampData values, or can use **ChampData.ALL** if you want to receive all data.

The Riot Games API has two different League endpoints.

One to get **the entire league of a summoner** (includes entries of the other 99 summoners in that same league): 

https://euw.api.pvp.net/api/lol/euw/v2.5/league/by-summoner/62128873,%2019881488?api_key=<API-KEY-GOES-HERE>

The library method that uses this endpoint is **getLeagueBySummoners()**.

and one just to get **the league entry of a summoner**, (only includes the summoners specified): 

https://euw.api.pvp.net/api/lol/euw/v2.5/league/by-summoner/62128873,%2019881488/entry?api_key=<API-KEY-GOES-HERE>

The library method that uses this endpoint is **getLeagueEntryBySummoners()**.

The reason you're getting the wrong division is you're using the method to get all the summoners in the same League as the summoners provided, and looking at the first entry of that list, which will likely be the data for a random summoner rather than the one you wanted.

**TLDR: Based on the URL given in your example, I believe you want to use the method getLeagueEntryBySummoners() rather than getLeagueBySummoners().**

Kind of confusing and easy to mix up. I'll think of a way to better clarify things like this for the future.

Hope this helps.

Because of this, there's a bit of inconsistency found between endpoints. Some endpoints expect a Region, some expect a PlatformID. 

From what I've heard, PlatformID and Region are different, because it is possible that a region can have multiple PlatformIDs. However, the current the relationship between region and platform ID is one-to-one, so there is essentially no difference between the two at this point in time.

As library designers, we _could_ have abstracted the concept of a PlatformID, and just used the Region enum for all methods, but we decided against this in case the one-to-one mapping between Region and PlatformID changes in the future.

**TLDR: They are basically the same thing with different names. Some methods expect a PlatformID, some methods expect a Region.**

How would that work when using listeners to wait for the result?

Example:

```
        // Asynchronously get summoner information
        AsyncRequest requestSummoner = apiAsync.getSummonersById(region, summonerId);
        requestSummoner.addListener(new RequestAdapter() {
            @Override
            public void onRequestSucceeded(AsyncRequest<Map<String, Summoner>> request) { // error because this is different from the overridden super method
                Map<String, Summoner> summoners = request.getDto();
                // ...
            }
        });
```

Sure, you could make `RequestListener` a `RequestListener<T>`, but then it could only listen to one specific method. Also nothing guarantees `RequestListener<T>` to have the same `T` as `AsyncRequest<T>`, which makes things very fishy.

Another thought, what's with the design pattern to have one listener listen to every asynchronous request via `RiotApiAsync#addListener()`? I have one use-case in production which actually implements `RequestListener` and listens to all kinds of requests.
You could end up using a `RequestListener<?>` here, but that's even more fishy, since then you will have zero knowledge about the actual return type.

Also changing the `RiotApiAsync` methods this way would cause lots of conversion warnings which is dirty as hell:

```
    public AsyncRequest<Map<String, List<League>>> getLeagueEntryBySummoners(Region region, long... summonerIds) {
        Objects.requireNonNull(region);

I dont think so. `addListener(RequestListener>` can be changed to `addListener(RequestListener<T>)`. The addListener would only accept Listeners that can listen T then.

> Also changing the RiotApiAsync methods this way would cause lots of conversion warnings

This is because type safty is not built in the other functions. If you start being typesafe from lowlevel on, they will disappear:

```
class EndPointmanager {
    public <T> AsyncRequest<T> callMethodAsynchronously(method) { .....}
}

ApiMethod<Map<String, Summoner> method = new GetSummonersByName(getConfig(), region, Convert.joinString("","", summonerNames));
return endpointManager.callMethodAsynchronously(method);
```

I know its a big change and would require a lot of code being changed but I think its worth it. The global listener is a problem though. I have to think about how this could be solved. hm..

I'm personally already using the current master branch in a test environment for my production applications, and so far it seems to be stable and working correctly for the methods that I'm actively using.

A lot has changed since the last release. This has various reasons, most significantly the conversion to Riot Api v3.

When converting from v3.8 or v3.9 to v4.0, all of the old method calls will need to be adjusted because methods no longer use a `Region` but a `Platform` parameter now due to the Riot Api v3 drifting away from regions and going towards platforms exclusively. Other than that, batch calls are no longer supported by Riot Api v3, and thus have been removed from this wrapper aswell. Methods might also have their parameters or return DTOs adjusted to reflect other changes to the Riot Api endpoints.

I believe you are receiving this error because you are using your normal API key in place of a Tournament API key.

Before you are able to use the Tournament API, you will need a Tournaments API Key. This is different from the default developer API key Riot provides you when you make an account on the Developer Portal, and is specifically used for everything related to the Tournaments API.

If you don't have a Tournament API Key, you should visit the [Developer Portal](https://developer.riotgames.com/) dashboard, and 'Register a Project'. Make sure you specify that you are registering this project to use the Tournaments API using the drop-down they provide, or Riot will correct you and you will have to start the process all over again (been there, done that). 

Once you register your project, Riot will look it over and provide you with a conditional demo tournament key that you can use.

If you are using v3.9 of the library, here's an example of Tournaments API code that passes a normal API key and a tournaments API key as two different parameters:

        String tournamentCode = api.createTournamentCode(tournamentId, 5, TournamentMap.SUMMONERS_RIFT,

I think I answered your question on how include image data in this issue - https://github.com/rithms/riot-api-java/issues/51#issuecomment-186664993

If you are using **getDataChampionList(Region region, String locale, String version, boolean dataById, ChampData... champData)** and specifying that you want image data included,

For example - 

``` java
ChampionList championList = api.getDataChampionList(Region.NA, null, null, false, ChampData.IMAGE);
```

and you are still receiving null values, something is wrong and I would ask you to provide a code example so we can look into it.

With that said, Ddragon doesn't name image files after the champion's **name**, it is named after champion **keys**. For many champions, name and key are the same, but for others this is not the case (i.e. The champion key for Wukong is MonkeyKing, and the name of his image file on ddragon is MonkeyKing.png).

Thus, using the value returned from **getKey()** rather than **getName()** should solve your issue.

You're talking about the getRecentGames() method.
This method uses the game-v1.3 endpoint of the Riot Games API.
The documentation for the endpoint specifies that the data type used for the games is a Set<Game>.
When I first created the library I stuck strictly to this documentation to make it as consistent as possible.

As time went on, we have improved the library and deviated from the documentation if it makes more sense and provides convenience for developers.

Regardless of the documentation, the endpoint returns the games in a JSON array, and it looks like it is ordered. I see no reason why we cannot update the library to return a List instead. With that said, we are currently working on version 4 of the library which includes some pretty major changes.

To get more data, you must specifically request it using the available query parameters.

You are probably using the method that specifies no query parameters:

So you are only getting back a Champion object with an ID, name, and key. Everything else you didn't specify is null.

You can use the overloaded method:
**api.getDataChampionList(Region region, String locale, String version, boolean dataById, ChampData... champData)**

to ask for more information:

For example, to get champion image data:

``` java
ChampionList championList = api.getDataChampionList(Region.NA, null, null, false, ChampData.IMAGE);
```

or, to get champion image data, and information about champion skins:

``` java
ChampionList championList = api.getDataChampionList(Region.NA, null, null, false, ChampData.IMAGE, ChampData.SKINS);
```

or to get ALL champion data, without having to specify each individual parameter:

``` java
ChampionList championList = api.getDataChampionList(Region.NA, null, null, false, ChampData.ALL);

This is a known issue with the version you are using, and has been fixed. No Java 8 methods are included in the latest release of the library, and everything should play nicely with Android.

I have removed the bugged riot-api-java-v3.8.2 (Android) version from releases to avoid further confusion.

> I could not even compile it, I don't really know why, didn't know what the error messages meant but there was something wrong with Java I think ( prob because it used jdk8 and not jdk 7 like it is in android studio).

Please download and use the latest release, [v3.9.0](https://github.com/rithms/riot-api-java/releases/tag/v3.9.0), and comment here with any issues you have using that version.

Why do you have to do it like that and not:

summoner = summoners.get(params[0])      ?

And when does the call to the RiotServer happen?

Here:
Map<String, Summoner> summoners = api.getSummonersByName(params[0]);

or here:

return summoners.get(params[0].replaceAll(""\s+"", """").toLowerCase());

Thanks for bringing to my attention that you found the library through riot-api-java.com and mentioning the download link on the site is still directing to dropbox (where we used to host the latest JAR). I will be sure to update the page and apply the feedback you have given.

The Riot Games API returns summoner information as a map, where the key values are the summoner names in all lower case and stripped of spaces.

For example if you made a request to the Riot Games API for the following summoner names:
**RHYTHMS**, **Rithms**, **Tryn         damere**, **RY       z    e**,

you would receive the following data:

``` json
{
   ""rhythms"": {
      ""id"": 32236660,
      ""name"": ""Rhythms"",
      ""profileIconId"": 774,
      ""revisionDate"": 1453818380000,
      ""summonerLevel"": 30
   },
   ""rithms"": {
      ""id"": 35364656,
      ""name"": ""Rithms"",
      ""profileIconId"": 871,
      ""revisionDate"": 1454456414000,
      ""summonerLevel"": 30
   },
   ""ryze"": {
      ""id"": 329,
      ""name"": ""Ryze"",
      ""profileIconId"": 0,
      ""revisionDate"": 1454485335000,
      ""summonerLevel"": 30
   },
   ""tryndamere"": {
      ""id"": 133,
      ""name"": ""Tryndamere"",
      ""profileIconId"": 909,
      ""revisionDate"": 1451787512000,
      ""summonerLevel"": 30
   }
}
```

Similarly, when using the library and making a request such as:

``` java
Map<String, Summoner> summoners = api.getSummonersByName(""RITHMS, TRYN DA mere"");
```

You will have to access the Summoner objects of the map using the summoner name, all lowercase, stripped of spaces since the keys are case sensitive:

``` java
Summoner summoner = summoners.get(""tryndamere"");
```

Since the Android application example is taking in user input, and using that user input as a key to access the summoner object in the map, stripping the spaces and making all characters lower case with **params[0].replaceAll(""\s+"", """").toLowerCase()** makes sure you are using the correct key, regardless if the user searches for ""**T    R    Y   N    DA   MERE**"" or ""**Tryndamere**"" rather than just ""**tryndamere**"".

> And when does the call to the RiotServer happen?
> 
> Here:
> Map summoners = api.getSummonersByName(params[0]);
> 
> or here:
> 
> return summoners.get(params[0].replaceAll(""\s+"", """").toLowerCase());

The library makes calls to the API when the method is called, so this line is where the call is happening:

``` java
Map summoners = api.getSummonersByName(params[0]);
```

The following line is just retrieving the summoner from the map:

``` java
return summoners.get(params[0].replaceAll(""\s+"", """").toLowerCase());
```

This Android example is a bit outdated. If you are only interested in querying for one summoner at a time, you can use the following lines of code instead:

``` java
@Override
    protected Summoner doInBackground(String... params) {

        RiotApi api = new RiotApi(
                ""apikeyhiddenforreasons"");
        try {
            api.setRegion(Region.EUW);
            Summoner summoner = api.getSummonerByName(params[0]);
            return summoner;
        } catch (RiotApiException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

        return null;
    }
```

Note this example is using getSummonerByName() rather than getSummoner**s**ByName(). Because only one summoner is being requested, the library returns a single Summoner object rather than a Map with one entry.

Hope that makes sense.

Cons:

I prefer people to open issues rather than contact me on Twitter. It's sometimes hard to fit everything in 140 characters.

I'm down to add or merge stuff from your existing codebase, but it would have to take into consideration whats already in place, and likely be modified to fit. We don't want existing code breaking, or require people to completely rewrite their existing apps if they want to use the latest changes and features. 

I don't feel like this should be a big issue with adding features like persistence and rate limit throttling, but when you talk about re-structuring things, we have to be careful about that.

We have a lot of contributors already, so I have no problem with you opening pull requests to contribute. I'm always happy to add more people as collaborators, but I want to make sure whoever I add as a collaborator understands the codebase enough to make quality contributions. 

For example, I recently added Linnun the CEO of lolskill.net as a collaborator, because he has been a long time contributor, has numerous quality pull requests, has a large codebase using the library, and probably knows more about it than me at this point. :)

While this might have some advantages for the future, we obviously would break every single project using this code. It's hard to estimate how many projects are currently using this API and would be affected by this change, but with a proper note in the release notes I don't see much of a problem there.

Throttling and caching might be useful for some small project, but must definitely be optional features, since they won't work for big-scaling projects.
For example, I'm using one API code for a project that has multiple different applications, so I can't simply enter my rates into a single app. Also I run multiple instances of each app on different servers (for load balancing etc.) - making it even harder to properly throttle the rates.
Caching is a troubly topic for the same reasons - having multiple instances of an app across multiple servers makes it hard to cache data. You could be lucky to have the same request on the same server twice within the caching time, but in practice the second request is more likely to land on a different server - ultimatively you'll end up caching every request but will hardly ever make use of the cached data.
Also you may not want to cache every kind of method call. Let's say a user wants to look up his game, but he hits the button too early and gets a ""not ingame"" message. If he hits the button again 5 seconds later, the cache might keep telling him that he is not ingame, even though he actually is. Same issue the other way around: The game ended and the user started a new game, but the cache will still show his old game. These are just some of the issues I already had to deal with when building my custom caching methods - there is definitely alot to keep in mind.

While I don't mind having some basic caching or throttling methods, this definitely is not a high priority in my eyes.

I noticed this quote by me might be misleading. It is _preferred_ we don't break people's code, but we have done so in the past to up the quality of the library. When we do, we just mention it in the release notes (Like we did in [the latest release](https://github.com/rithms/riot-api-java/releases/tag/v3.7.0)). I didn't mean for it to sound like we can't improve the structure and quality of the existing code at all.

Unfortunatelly I have alot of stuff to do this weekend, but I hope to be able to have a deeper look into your code in a few days. For now, I just took a quick look at your Throttle class because I was interested in how you implemented that. I'm very unhappy with how you hard-fix the rates in the code like this:

```
    if (isDevelopmentKey) {
        requestsPer10 = 10;
        requestsPer600 = 500;
    } else {
        requestsPer10 = 300;
        requestsPer600 = 180000;
    }
```

I got applications with rates higher than that, because those 180000 limits just aren't enough for some apps. In your API you assume everyone to have the exact same limits - which may be true for standard-sized apps, but just doesn't cover all apps.
Also why do you need a class for Throttling at all? Wouldn't it be enough to have a setRateLimits(int per10, int per600) method in your main class? (If not set, no throttling will be done. If set, throttling will be done according to the given rates).

On a small side note, I like your use of a StringBuilder to build URLs within the API implementations. Looking forward to find some more goodies in your code in a few days.

Yeah, me too.

I would actually like to solve the general problem of: given _N_ time windows of _M_ requests each design a class that maximizes number of requests from _X_ clients without any client ever receiving a 429 response. The current `RiotApiThrottle` does maximize number of requests without getting a single 429, however _X_ is bound to 1 (that is only a single client can be in use at once, Linnun raised this point earlier when he mentioned load balancing) and the time windows are hardcoded. There is a technology called [HornetQ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HornetQ) that can help make it possible for distributed computing nodes (like load balanced servers) to synchronize critical components like rate throttles. Setting up HornetQ can be nasty, nor do I know how invasive it would be to make existing code compatible.

Additionally, a single `Thread` object pulls tasks from a queue. In a real high-speed environment this queue would become prohibitively large and, because it's managing an `ArrayBlockingQueue`, will actually cause the thread posting tasks (see `throttle.post(..)`) to block. In a real world application this would cause your UI thread or request processing thread to hang, not good.

Finally, it should be using a `ThreadPool` not a single thread. I did try using a thread pool originally, but I ran into some bugs on Riot's side. The best thing the current throttle did for me was show me the non-obvious issue that you have to time requests from the time you receive the response, not the time you send the response. It seems that Riot sets times on when the request completes. They also seem to like a 1.5 second buffer. So the throttling service is certainly a work in progress.

That is, when a request comes in the scheduler looks into the future and determines when a request can execute. It does not delay until a time has passed then allows a request to execute. This allows for some slick usage of Java's scheduling thread pool. My repo is https://github.com/dancarpenter21/lol-api-java and if you want to check stuff out look at the class org.dc.riotapi.service.scheduler.RiotApiScheduler.java. It's a pretty complex class but the gist is that the `schedule` method adds a callback to a ThreadPool for execution. The service then analyzes network rates and conditions to approach an ideal speed based on rate rules and outside factors. The issue that's going to arise now is all these asynchronous calls are resulting in callback hell when I want to do anything real. Since every request that I want to be throttled has to be passed in as a `Runnable` essentially there's a lot of inner class nesting going on. I also need to add a nice way to handle 429 codes but I do have a strategy in mind. I might be able to add that tonight. In all I think my approach will perform well, but might be too unwieldy to be useful. I definitely feel that a Reactive approach is the way to go here.

Adding caches is a piece of cake with Guava, but making an intuitive cache configuration isn't as simple.

From what I remember, you can let Guava expire your cache by time or by amount of items in cache.  You could set a single value for each used by every API and just optionally pass it to the constructor. I don't think this is an optimal solution since you might want to cache things differently. For example, summoner data you might want to expire by time, match data you might want to expire based on how many so your RAM doesn't fill up excessively and static data you might not want to ever expire at all.

As you can probably see, the API separates this info into two different objects, League, and LeagueEntry. That's because a League can have multiple divisions, consisting of multiple summoners, thus multiple league entries.

You use getLeagueEntryBySummoner() instead of getLeagueBySummoner() if you only want to get league entry info for the summoner you want. getLeagueBySummoner() returns league entry info for ALL summoners in the same league as the summoner.

Hope this helps.

Adding PlatformIds to Regions in the code allows us to abstract away the idea of PlatformIds from developers using the library, because we could make it so the current-game method converts from Region -> PlatformId.

In the end, we would have:
getCurrentGameInfo(Region region, long summonerId)

getCurrentGameInfo(PlatformId platformId, long summonerId)

Currently, there is a one to one mapping for regions that are supported in the API. However, that may not always be true, if we add additional regions in the future. Any changes along those lines will be documented though.

Maybe it's best to just keep them separate then... Since it seems like the one-to-one mapping could potentially change, I'd hate to have to make them separate again in the future if they ever did change.

You will need to create a proxy server to act as an intermediary. 

It isn't too hard to set up.

This will make it so instead of having your application contain the key and make requests such as:
https://na.api.pvp.net/api/lol/na/v1.2/champion?api_key=<API-KEY>

You can do:
https://myproxyserver.net/api/lol/na/v1.2/champion

and not have your key in your application.

The library can be used at the proxy server level or the application level, but if you use it at the application level, you will need to replace the request URL with your proxy server domain, and recompile the library.

I might make a tutorial on how to create a proxy server to use for a distributed application, and add a feature to the library so you can do something along the lines of:

RiotApi api = new RiotApi(""proxyserver.net"");

which replaces the https://na.api.pvp.net/ with your proxy. This would assume the proxy is set up route and handle query parameters properly though.

I would encourage doing all the processing at the server level however, and feed only what is needed to your app.

On the other hand, having a proxy server will bring more troubles, like you'd need to authenticate somehow the client  with it so that no one can use that server apart from your app, not doing so would be the same situation as giving your rior api key away.

3 If nothing is passed, the method will see Champdata[] {}, an array of length 0.

I believe the current check is problematic: it's not complete for case 2, since you might want to pass, {null, ChampData.IMAGE}, and this would not parse the IMAGE param. And also cases 1 and 3 would fail, with nullpointerexception and arrayindexoutofboundsexception respectively.

So, what should the test look like if we want to support developers  getthe 3 cases? I believe something like this:

if (champData == null || champData.length == 0 || ((champData.length ==1) && (champData[0] == null)) {
 // do nothing
} else {
// do something
}

be aware that we need to test this way because we need operator shortcircuiting (test length only if champdata is not null, check first element  only if length is not zero).

as I said, varargs are a bitch.

The RiotApi is not completely stateless as it relies on (Key, Region, Season) to shorten queries.

For some programs querying multiple regions, having those properties static would need we either have to
- Set them before each call
- Use the long version of the queries with the region as parameter

wich is more overhead than creating an object with the key as parameter.

Furthermore, this would make multi-threaded use of the library more difficult as you can not rely on 

``` java
RiotApi.setRegion(EU)
RiotApi.getFoo()
```

to return values from EU, has it might have been changed in another thread in between.

An object with state and static methods is more or less a Singleton, and I don't think the current design is well suited for this.

A way I could see this work is if you'd remove all state with chained methods, holding only the Key as a state (wich could also be problematic if you want to use 2 test keys if your application is not validated yet), and chain calls like
RiotApi.getRegion(""EU"").getChampions(foo...)

If the problem you want to eliminate is the constant use of the key, you could create a getApi() factory method that would create the RiotApi object based on a java .properties file holding the key.

That's just a trivial example.  Any app with more than a few dependencies becomes unmanageable to control the dependencies when code uses static.  You just end up having to create your own non-static objects that call the static behind the scenes.

In Java, class variables (double) are initialized to 0. So when the translation from JSON String -> Java object happens, if a rune doesn't contain a value for that specific data, it will be left as 0.

I could of course, make an easier way, so you do not have to do all the extra work (brute forcing all the stats to check if they != 0, just to get the stats for one rune).

The question remains though, if I were to implement an easier way, what would be the best/most useful way to provide the data to you; how would you like the data to be stored? 

I am thinking of changing the getStats() method to return a Map<String, Double>? (ie. Key = FlatArmorMod, Value = 0.5471). Or maybe having a completely separate method, called getStatsMap() leaving the functionality of getStats() as is.

            System.out.println(rune.getValue().getId());
            System.out.println(rune.getValue().getName());
            System.out.println(rune.getValue().getDescription());

        }
```

To easily get a respective runes stats.

The output will look something like this:

```

###########################
5234

```

Please note, you will be using the getStat() method.
The getStats() remains as is.

Please update to version 3.3.5 for these changes, and open up a new issue if you have any further questions, concerns, and/or complaints.

Hope this helps!

The API call is a network operation, therefore it must be performed off the main UI thread.

Fortunately, Android makes it easy for you through the use of AsyncTasks. 

You will need to create a new subclass that extends AsyncTask, and make the API call in the doInBackground method.

Also be sure to include the Internet permission to your app.

I can provide you with example code of what I am talking about when I get home.

``` java
public class MainActivity extends Activity{

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);

                    ""API-KEY"");
            try {

                if(summoners != null) {
                    return summoners.get(params[0].replaceAll(""\\s+"", """").toLowerCase());
                }
            } catch (RiotApiException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();

                dis.setText(String.valueOf((result.getSummonerLevel())));
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This code hasn't been tested, but it should give you an example of what needs to be done.

Also, you might even want to have global class that contains your RiotApi object, that way, you don't need to create a new one every time you want to make an API call in your app, and can just use one RiotAPI object for your whole Android app.

An example of this would be:

``` java
import android.app.Application;
import main.java.riotapi.RiotApi;

public class GlobalClass extends Application {

    private RiotApi api;

    public GlobalClass() {
        this.api = new RiotApi(""API-KEY"");
    }

    public RiotApi getApi() {
        return api;
    }

}
```

An example doInBackground method of an AsyncTask, similar to the previous one would be:

``` java
 protected Summoner doInBackground(String... params) {

                try {
                    Summoner summoner = ((GlobalClass)getActivity().getApplication()).getApi()
                            .getSummonerByName(params[0])
                            .get(params[0].replaceAll(""\\s+"", """").toLowerCase());
                    if(summoner != null) {
                        return summoner;
                    }
                } catch (RiotApiException e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                }

                return null;
            }
```

Hope this helps.

Subject: [riot-api-java] Parameter encoding issue (#4)

if it call riot api in english, its work
but it shown error in other language

ex:
api.getSummonersByName(""?????"");
// this is my nick name in korean
output: unauthnized exception

because url is invalid
called URL is http://riot.~~~~~/by-name/??????api_key=kkkkkkkkhttp://riot.%7E%7E%7E%7E%7E/by-name/%EC%B9%B4%EC%8B%9C%EC%98%A4%EA%B0%80%ED%94%BC?api_key=kkkkkkkk.
riot server need /by-name/{{nickname}} and api_key={{kkkkkkk}}
but riot will parse /by-name/{{??????api_key=kkkkkkkk}} and api_key is null

so it need to adding urlencoding as ""UTF-8""
ex:
api.getSummonersByName(URLEncoder.encode(""?????"", ""UTF-8""));

but it not need to encoding when extracting ID
because Map's key have a String without encoded

Summoner summoner = summoners.get(""?????"");

summary)
If region is allowed local language nick name, you have to use URLEncoder with ""UTF-8""
and dont use URLEncoder when extract ID from Summoner MAP

ex)
//below code is works
api.getSummonersByName(URLEncoder.encode(""?????"", ""UTF-8""));
Summoner summoner = summoners.get(""?????"");
id = Long.toString(summoner.getId());

thanks rithms

For the template API, the following could be possible:

```
{{ if not UseThirdPartyLibrary }}
    {{ ignore file }}
{{ end }}
```

Another way could be to enrich the `project.json` file itself:

```
{
    ""UseThirdPartyLibrary"": [true, false],
    ""path/to/requirements"": { ""KeepIf"": ""{{UseThirdPartyLibrary}}"" }
}
```

The latter could be a good start to a more modular `project.json`:

```
{
    ""Variables:"" {
        ""Name"": ""License Template"",
        ""Description"": ""Template to create licences for projects very easily"",
        ""Author"": ""Tamer Tas"",
        ""Year"": ""2015"",
        ""License"": [
            ""Apache Software License 2.0"",
            ""MIT"", 
            ""GNU GPL v3.0"",
            ""No license please""
        ]
    },
    ""Prompt:"" {
        ""Name"": ""Project name"",
        ""Description"": ""Short description"",
        ""Author"": ""Your name"",
        ""License"": ""Pick a license""
    },
    ""Files"": {
        ""LICENSE"": ""ignore if eq License \""No license please\""""
    },
    ""Hooks"": {
        ""OnStart"": ""script_start.sh"",
        ""OnFinish"": ""script_end.sh""
    }
}
```

Which is readable as:

```
{
    ""Variables:"" {
        ""VariableName1AsUsedInTemplate"": ""default value"",
        ""VariableName2AsUsedInTemplate"": [""acceptable"", ""values""]
    },
    ""Prompt:"" {
        ""VariableName1AsUsedInTemplate"": ""message displayed in prompt before waiting for the variable""
    },
    ""Files"": {
        ""path/to/file"": ""command allowing keep/ignore file on some variable values""
    },
    ""Hooks"": {
        ""event name"": ""path/to/script/to/execute"",

The first thing I noticed when building the image was, that I need to mount two volumes from my host, since I think it makes no sense to create files with boilr just in the container.

How would you call boilr running with Docker?

An alternative could also be to use `docker-compose` for that, a `yml` file could look like:

```
version: '2'
services:
  boilr:

If I understood your problem correctly, you are developing on `github.com/rawkode/boilr/...`,
but changes you've made are not used, since imports still use `github.com/tmrts/boilr/...`.

You can get around this by doing the following:

``` bash
go get github.com/tmrts/boilr OR git clone https://github.com/tmrts/boilr
cd $BOILR_REPO # Wherever
git remote add fork https://github.com/rawkode/boilr

I don't want to use `{{ If ExpertMode }}` in the templates. Its the initial questioning of the user that I'm interested in.

So if I define my condition stuff, the user gets asked about this question only if the condition is true.

- User gets asked: `Please choose a value for ""AppName""`
- User gets asked: `Please choose a value for ""ExpertMode""`

 We can assume that any successful template will have new features and bug fixes. But, I didn't consider updating used templates when the boilr templates are updated since the aim at the moment is to provide a starter boilerplate for users.

However, I can see the benefit of adding a mechanism as a plugin command (`boilr plugin X args`) with some modifications.

I think using `upgrade` might be confusing to people since templates are saved locally and they
might think it is for updating stored templates. Instead `migrate` might be a better name for this context.

In order to allow people to upgrade their used templates, the used template needs to be parsed but I'm not sure if that's the way to go. Instead, boilr can store the answers given to that particular template and then when asked `boilr plugin migrate <path>`, it can automatically use the same answers, but it might overwrite the changes so users **either**, need to be warned about this **or** as you suggested a read-only template mechanism can be implemented (e.g. `boilr use --read-only <template-name> <target-dir>`)

Cons of automatically using the answers:
- Needs execution records, if the template is used on machine A, can't be migrated on machine B

Cons of read-only templates:
- Introduces even more complexity from the users point of view since they need to know about doing read-only templates and then using the plugin. Instead a composed single command is better.

I have tried the same. (Have not ran out of API count).

The function works if the cell with the string to which the function's
parameter points does not contain quotes. With the quotes, it shows up a
blank cell.

(Use just en:Banded_woodpecker instead of ""en:Banded_woodpecker"" in the
parameter cell).
This is quite in tune with the normal spreadsheet conventions.

As you can see from this trivial example, the problem is hard, especially when there is no context. The Wikipedia Search API returns the most probable (list of) thing(s) for string, which is what I am exposing in the add-on. Everything else would be far beyond the scope of the objectives of the tool, which is why I hope you understand if I close the issue. Hope you still find the add-on useful!

I suggest an additional disambiguation-index.

If the tool finds a disambiguation page, 
you could set the disambiguation-index to something like: 
x =' [Disambiguation Type I](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Begriffskl%C3%A4rung#Die_Begriffskl.C3.A4rungsseite_.28BKS.29)
y = [Disambiguation Type II](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Begriffskl%C3%A4rung#BKL_II_.E2.80.93_Das_Stichwort_f.C3.BChrt_auf_den_gel.C3.A4ufigsten_Sachartikel)

So together with the reliability-index, the user would have a helpful information about 
the quality of each result :-)

Aim is to get a basis for an ABC-decision:
- which results can we use immediately
- which can we improve in an easy way by hand 
- which should we temporarily throw away

@yuvipanda, not sure I understand. If I have a Quarry query, say [1226](https://quarry.wmflabs.org/query/1226)  (the query ID is at the end of the URL), in the [HTML source code](https://quarry.wmflabs.org/query/1226) I can find (reformatted for legibility reasons)…

``` javascript
var vars = {
  ""can_edit"": false,
  ""is_starred"": false,
  ""published"": true,
  ""qrun_id"": 68094,
  ""query_id"": 1226
};
```

…so if I want to get the output for [Quarry query 1226](https://quarry.wmflabs.org/query/1226), I first have to scrape `https://quarry.wmflabs.org/query/1226`, extract the `qrun_id` 68094, and then call the JSON output URL `https://quarry.wmflabs.org/run/68094/output/0/json?download=true`.

I don't see where to put `latest` as you suggested in your [tweet](https://twitter.com/yuvipanda/status/705568981046788097). Or am I getting you terribly wrong?

- WIKICATEGORYMEMBERS per above
- Not sure how WIKIARTICLESAROUND is calculated, but it might be worth limiting to namespaces (Say I wanted to figure out the relationships between policies on a particular wiki in the Wikipedia: Space, or I was interested in categories or templates). 
- WIKIINBOUNDLINKS, WIKIMUTUALLINKS, WIKIOUTBOUNDLINKS (specially, being able to distinguish between mainspace, and other kinds of spaces -- you may want to know if the article has been talked on in talk pages for instance, or is referenced in Wikipedia: space)
- WIKISEARCH -- probably can piggy back on MediaWiki's search by namespace features already there. For this one, you probably want a field that allows for multiple namespaces.

I think, of the existing tools, those are the only ones where you don't specifically query a title, so it would be worth being able to limit the outcomes.

Can you run it on CFArtGallery?

If so, can you tell me more about the db you are tying to run against. 
If not, can you tell me more about your coldfusion server setup? Webserver, mappings, aliases, etc.

I've come across the same problem and thought I'd fire my findings up here.
The problem is with a bug in CF8 and CF9, I believe it has been fixed in CF9.1, but I haven't tested that yet.

The problem lies with the ArrayIsDefined() function which has a bug, resulting in an error when you pass it an index greater than the size of the array.
The quick fix is the change the conditional logic to to check for the length of the array as well.

I Updated the Apptacular\handlers\cfc\db\table.cfc and changed line 152 from 

if (ArrayIsDefined(columns, i+1)){

to

if (arrayLen(columns) gte i+1 and ArrayIsDefined(columns, i+1)){

and this fixes the error during code generation.

Hopefully this helps someone else.

Regards,
Odhran Hardy.

1. create new CFBuilder project
2. create Apptacular Application
3. edit database model > change entity name on one of the tables
4. regenerate Application

Now the entity for witch you just changed the entity name has double properties.

I've had to change the entity name because the name of the column is ""member"" and this is a reserved word in ColdFusion ORM/Hibernate. I changed it to iMember (not because of Apple, the first letter of the name of the application is ""i"").

I've send you the schema in december per email, let me know if you want me to resend it.

I wrote this simple script to get the names of all the system views in SQL server - I'm sure M$ add new tables and as Terry appears to no longer develop apptacular he won;t be aware of the new views. Simply run the script and copy and paste the list of views it creates. Instructions will be displayed after running the script........

&lt;cfdbinfo name=""dbi"" datasource=""yourdatasource"" type=""Tables""&gt;
&lt;cfquery name=""dbi"" dbtype=""query"" &gt;
    select \* from dbi where table_type='VIEW'
&lt;/cfquery&gt;

    Copy the quoted values below and paste them at the bottom of /handlers/cfc/db/datasource.cfc just below the last excludedTableList (About line 455)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Happy to help. To give some insight into why that regex is there - Windows paths usually look like `X:\path\to\place`, where X is a drive letter. There are however variations. See this link for specific details: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/naming-a-file#maximum-path-length-limitation but basically, the way to ensure a path that might be too long for old windows API doesn't break stuff is to prefix it with `\\?\`, so you get something like `\\?\X:\path\to\place`. Programming languages usually then escape these slashes, so your string is `\\\\?\X:\\path\\to\\place`. This is all well and good - [except](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3591840/are-extended-length-paths-safe-to-use) that only some Windows API actually supports this extended syntax.

My regex workaround is to grab the string starting only from the first alphabetical character, i.e. the drive letter.

Windows using Travis and Appveyor. It built on top of japaric's
trust <https://github.com/japaric/trust> template.

Basically none of this works anymore and you can feel complete freedom to
start from the ground up. I did some initial testing using *trust* and hit
a few issues, but that doesn't mean that isn't a valid path.

Some possible paths:

   - Use travis/appveyor's ""happy path"" for rust on multiple platforms
   <https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/multi-os/>. Basic unit tests worked a
   few weeks ago using the Linux image on Travis, that is probably a good
   place to start.
   - Use *trust* to do cross compiling:
   it uses it's own tools to set things up and I'm not sure it is really
   necessary anymore, but it is an option.
   - Use *Nix <https://nixos.org/nix/>*: this is kind of the direction I
   was planning but is highly complicated and not really mature. I don't
   recommend this path unless you are already a Nix aficionado.

T
he basic process is:

   - O
   pen a PR and Travis tests will run automatically.
   - Get unit tests working for all 3 platforms.
   - We'll do some test releases to try and get the process to release -- I
   think I'm the only person who can do this, but if you find you can as well
   that would be great

When things are going well I'll add you as a contributor so you can approve
PRs!

|--|  83%  71% | REQ-data                | REQ-data-family, REQ-data-type, SPC-data
```

If you want just one of them, you specify it:
```
# art ls -L                                                                                                                                                                           
|  | DONE TEST | NAME                    | IMPLEMENTED  
```

When you pass the `-A` flag, additional flags disable columns. Interestingly, if you try to disable all of them it still displays `parts`, which is **definitely a bug**:

```
art ls -ADPOLT
|  | DONE TEST | NAME                    | PARTS   
|--|  83%  71% | REQ-data                | REQ-data-family, REQ-data-type, SPC-data
```

Do you mean you would like to ONLY display the name? I don't think that is currently supported (because of the above bug). I could add a
`-N` flag, but then I would have to support that *removing* the name when used with `-A`, which I suppose is fine (maybe someone might want to do that?).

The reason I am not using toml is because yaml *renders* correctly in markdown. See that issue for more details.

Basically, to look even remotely good you would need something like:

    # REQ-foo

    partof = ""REQ-bar""

I am not sure how good glob libraries are in rust right now (never used one) so I cannot tell you whether you can do this easily or whether you have to implement your own glob-parsing.

I love this tool and I am not sure I would change too much. I thought about creating this kind of tool before or creating my own - or rewriting this code base but now I can't see any benefit in that. We just need to few really small things.

I can't believe how many times I clicked on `🛈` and got redirected. More than that - when you do, you have to ""go back in history"" twice.

When you create new artifact - you should be redirected to it, I think so.

Now I got used to it - but first when I tried `artifact` I struggled to even **save** document because the button was not visible (it is on navigation bar).

Some other thing that kind of strikes me as not fairly implemented - is when _artifact_ has a single _part_. When _part_ is implemented - should the artifact be _50%_ or _100%_ like it is now? There is no way to specify a single dependency (inside the scope of the project). The dependency could be filled - that would mean _50%_.

Well, I am going to be redesigning the whole code base using flowcharts (using the tool itself), so if you really want to get involved in rewriting it that would be much appreciated! There's going to be a lot of work :smile:

> Some other thing that kind of strikes me as not fairly implemented - is when artifact has a single part. When part is implemented - should the artifact be 50% or 100% like it is now? There is no way to specify a single dependency (inside the scope of the project). The dependency could be filled - that would mean 50%. Let me know what is your motivation on that decision or is it just a bug.

This is a tough one, but the current behavior is intended.

The basic idea is that when you are designing a big feature its completion will be *completely determined by its subfeatures*. This is most obvious for `REQ`, since you literally *cannot* directly implement it.

However, I see your point. To aid in this, I am now implementing sublocations. So if you had a feature (`SPC-foo`) that had a large part as a separate spec (`SPC-foo-bar`) but also had two minor parts that were implemented directly in code (`SPC-foo.baz`, `SPC-foo.lab`), then those would show up as unimplemented if they were not implemented. You specify sublocations by just having `[[.baz]] [[.lab]]` anywhere in the text of your artifact, and then link with `#SPC-foo.baz`.

Between the `# REQ-name` and `###` there can exist *any arbitrary yaml*, so you can put literally anything there. Even better, `yaml` sees `#` as a comment, so it's not like `###` would have ever been parsed as real data anyway.

Speaking of yaml... I should think about maybe using a different format. I like the fact that yaml renders in markdown quite well though

I like reStructuredText better, but markdown is more common.
I'm not sure if I'd describe markdown as trivially parseable, is there no crate for that?

toml isn't very pretty, and does not have many features, but it's easy to maintain and easy to parse.
md is pretty, but: there are several dialects and extensions around (eg. [man 5 pandoc_markdown](https://linux.die.net/man/5/pandoc_markdown)) and AFAIR allows to litter HTML throughout the whole document.

I'd vote to implement a very small and restrictive subset of md, to keep it maintainable.

Interestingly, I actually like the fact that you can insert `html` in markdown -- it is a feature I use in the web-ui to great effect.

Also, I'm not suggesting I parse the markdown exactly... the basic design would be two regexes:

- The header line is (approximately):
```
#\s(REQ|TST|SPC)-\w+\s*
```

I would then pull lines into a buffer until I hit one of:
- the ""end of attributes"" line
```
###+\s*
```
- another header line
- the end of the file

If I hit another header line, the buffer==`text`. If I hit the ""end of attributes"" line then I parse until a header line and that is my text.

The parsed attributes would be desrialized using a yaml library, so I wouldn't have to do much there.

Let me make sure I understand your proposal. As I see it there are two of them:

## Feature1: add the ability to add ""tags""
This is something I would use #107 for. One of the design requirements of artifact is that it is very slow to add features and I am basically unwilling to add additional attributes at all (but would allow a plugin to do so).

## Feature 2: use pijul to track progress
I'm a little confused about the implementation here. I'm not sure why Pijul could provide any kind of automated way of detecting that a requirement changed (other than the way other version control systems already do). Also, I am unwilling to tie artifact to any *particular* vcs system

Related: I have another design I've been throwing around that I've been thinking could help address this. It would allow you to define ""mini specifications"" *inside* the text block of SPC or TST types that can link to source code. So you could do something like this:

```
[SPC-foo]
text = '''
This has multiple parts of implementation:
- [[.input]]: take the input
- [[.process]]: process the input
- [[.log]] log the result
'''
```

Each of these ""sub-parts"" could then be linked in code using `#SPC-foo.input`, `#SPC-foo.process`, etc. Since the `.` character is currently illegal, there is no possibility of overlap.

The sub-parts would then be used for also calculating the completeness of the item.

In the web-ui, you would be able to click to the line of code that the linked items are at.

This would also be useful when combined with #158, as you could create a graph that also links to code.",NA,https://api.github.com/repos/vitiral/artifact/issues/183/comments,https://github.com/vitiral/artifact/issues/183#issuecomment-338438833,https://api.github.com/repos/vitiral/artifact/issues/183

Somehow I forgot to do that. There should probably be a `REQ-completed` to reflect this dicussion.

The original logic was to have `#SPC-foo` mark anything as 100% done all the time. That was annoying, because you often want to link to parent items in code, as well as their children.

In the end, I settled on either the `done=` field or a link in code being the equivalent of a ""done child"". Note that if you *do mark the children as done* (either in code or with `done=`), then you don't need to mark the parent as done -- which is the behavior you want in the end.

This gives you an idea that:
- The parent is implemented somewhere in code
- Its children are not

This leads to being 50% done for a single child parent (which in my experience is unusual), to 33% done with two children, 25% with three children, etc -- and is a reasonably good description of the completion status of the item.

I am working on formalzing the logic and requirement using graphiz. Hopefully it should at least be easier to understand.

- change the name from `tools` -> `plugins`

It has extremely concise syntax and can be rendered as a imagemap (image where nodes can provide links).

Use graphiz to allow more programmatic trees, including links within nodes:
- http://www.graphviz.org/content/output-formats#dimap
- link support using imagemaps: http://www.graphviz.org/content/graphviz-links-within-record-nodes
- http://viz-js.com/ : this is probably the javascript library I would use to render things
    - if you replace the `a1` line with the following, you can get links to work in the SVG format: 
    - `{""[[REQ-foo]]"" [fontcolor=blue; URL=""https://google.com"";]} -> b3;`
- attributes are well documented here: http://www.graphviz.org/doc/info/attrs.html#d:URL

You can ""declare"" node attributes like this. Further attributes can still be defined at later points.

- nodes are just plain text `node`, a string `""a node""` or if you want to add attributes, a `{...}` block `{""a node"" [URL=""https://google.com""]}`
- nodes can be connected with `->`
- you can use the same name multiple times:

```
a -> b -> c
a -> c -> d -> e -> f
```

Also there is *some* way to specify if statements, but I can't find it right now...

It's the best tool for the job, I just wanted to sound the warning.
At first glance, dot seems elegant and simple; until you try to get it to behave the way you want.
One of the most offputting features: I wanted my subgraph in a box.
So, try to find the attribute in the [official documents](http://www.graphviz.org/content/attrs), the way they do their documentation is not my thing. Explanation and vaild scope are just too far away from each other.

At some time you give up and try to work [by example](http://www.graphviz.org/content/cluster). After bisection you realize nothing you did is different but you still won't get a box around the subgraph.
Once you realize, that you get a box around it, just by giving the subgraph a different name (e.g. cluster_0): that's why I think is ambiguous.

The tutorial notes _A cluster is a subgraph placed in its own distinct rectangle of the layout. A subgraph is recognized as a cluster when its name has the prefix cluster._ The Gallery example labeled Cluster has the text _This small example illustrates dot's feature to draw nodes and edges in clusters or separate rectangular layout regions. Clusters are encoded as subgraphs whose names have the prefix 'cluster'._  Subgraphs and clusters relate to the graph's topology; they are not layout or rendering attributes.

In particular, I am concerned about the following:
- how does `table!` handle foreign keys?
- it would be worth writing the type and creating some unit tests to interact with it in basic ways
  - insert a row
  - delete the row
  - read the row
  - query a row
  - use multiple tables with foreign keys and do queries based on them

The unit tests above in particular are going to help you validate that you have some idea on how to interface with the database and is going to significantly help you write your implementation.

- I like the idea of extra attributes through `settings.toml`. I had previously thought about using an `extra` parameter directly on the artifact which was arbitrarily json but this is much better. I'm thinking of the format and I'm thinking something like:
```
[attrs]
# you must specify the type, these are optional and have no constraints (besides type)
unchecked-int = ""int""
unchecked-str = ""string""

[attrs.checked-int]
type = ""int""
min = 0
max = 10
required = true

[attrs.optional-checked-str]
type = ""str""
max = 10  # max refers to the length
```
- for querying, I think you would need to use something like [jsonpath](https://github.com/dchester/jsonpath). This would be through a flag in the cmdline and an option in the web-ui
- for web-ui probably would just display these below partof/parts. For `ls` command there would probably be an `--attrs` method where you could spell out the attributes to list.

Other reasons this would be nice:
- I would like to support plugins in the future. Some of these plugins would probably want to have custom attributes.

But, as you, I fear the added complexity in code, usability and configuration will divert attention from the original goal of artifact (*simple* quality), which I'd rather not sacrifice.

As @rubdos, I have thought about (mis?)-using it for checking and enforcing attributes, to define structure on i.e. scenarios (or user-stories), stakeholders (needs, roles, goals, ...) and possibly other artifacts.

(kinda off-topic) My ""solution"" until now: 
- Write a REQ that you want to document something (identify stakeholders).
- Add the SPC which defines attributes you want to capture (role, goal, needs, representative, ...).
- Document these somewhere else (we use LaTeX) and mark that as the implementation of the spec.

Downsides to this approach:
- definitions are outside artifact and must be enforced through other means (as with all implementations).
- if you derive requirements from these, they will not be traceable in artifact.

I propose that if the string doesn't fit into the required width, then we iterate over the grapheme clusters until we reach the maximum appropriate unicode string width, then insert an ellipsis.

If we want to get fancy with ellipsis:
* If the string is all ASCII/Latin-1/etc then we shouldn't assume capabilities of the terminal and insert a 3 character pseudo-ellipsis `...`.
* If the string has fancy Unicode characters, then it should be safe to use more Unicode and insert a real ellipsis character `…`, thus letting us include two more characters of the original string.
This might be unneeded complexity though.

Yes!
And this leads to some questions:

1. How do I track the completion of my documentation? (to which you have suggested an answer, down below)

2. can *all* kinds of documentation relating to code reasonably be
shoehorned into the form of a specification? In my mind, specifications deals with all the interfaces that code presents, and there might be other aspects of code behaviour that one would also like to link to specific parts of the source code (such as algorithm design considerations, algorithm mechanics, program control flow (eg. 'this part of the code does the instantiations of all the constructors'))

3. Could it be a good idea to treat documentation (any doc that goes beyond requirements specification) as source code in itself? Thus using Artifact to track the completion of this documentation, just as it tracks real source code? This could perhaps be neat for my use case, but perhaps also for others. I see that the Artifact project has a wiki that documents all the doc aspects that goes beyond mere requirements specification. But how complete is this Wiki? Are there known requirements for the wikis content that hasn't yet been fulfilled? Could Artifact be used to track these
questions?

Further on, I guess some parts of the Wiki is tightly associated to
specific parts of the source code (or at least we could imagine this to be the case). Could Artifact be expanded to also track to which extend documentation (documentation that goes beyond specification) has documented specific 'documentation craving' parts of the source code?

> The main purpose of artifact is to write design docs and track where they are implemented (while also making code self documenting).

How does it become self documenting? By shoehorning all documentation aspects into the form of a specification?

Yes this will help, but it doesn't exactly give me full on documentation requirements fulfillment tracking.

My desired workflow would be something like this:

I write down requirements for my documentation (high level categories that I want my documentation to cover). Whenever I work on my source code, and I spot a component (function/module/constructor/etc.) that really needs documentation, I tag it with the relevant documentation requirement tag (and also the functions
name).

Then I go write some documentation and tag it as documenting component X. Then Artifact can tell me that, for requirement Q, I have documented component X, but I'm still missing to document the components Y and Z. Thus Artifact tracks to which extent I have actually written the documentation that I have required of myself.

But maybe it's just be. Maybe I should just get into the habit of phrasing all my documentation as a design specification. And live without full on tracking of my documentation progress.

Thanks for your time :)

I would like to point out that while artifact **does** track completion that is mostly for convienience. If you want to track ""task/story/epic"" completion I would use an agile tool Zenhub or just github issues

Maybe I will eventually make a task/story/epic tracking tool... but artifact is not it.

It sounds like most of what you want to do would be better done with task tracking tools and some source code `#DOCME` tags.

The primary purpose of artifact is once you *have* documented your code anyone reading your code can see which specification it implements (the `#SPC-my-spec` will be right there in the doc string). Then they can read your design docs to get an idea how everything fits toghther (and see where everything is implemented in source code)

> there might be other aspects of code behaviour that one would also like to link to specific parts of the source code (such as algorithm design considerations, algorithm mechanics, program control flow (eg. 'this part of the code does the instantiations of all the constructors'))

This is why you can do this:

```
[SPC-function]
text = '''
function does awesome stuff and uses:
- [[SPC-function-algorithm1]] to do awesome stuff 1
- [[SPC-function-algorithm2]] to do awesome stuff 2
'''

[SPC-function-algorithm1]
text = '''
algorithm that is awesome
'''

[SPC-function-algorithm2]
text = '''
another algorithm that is awesome
'''
```

  * What I have currently copies the diesel tutorial very closely (ex: to show tests run `cargo run --bin show_tests`) I don't think this is what we want, but it's the first thing I as able to get working.
* Where should the database be stored and when should it be created?
  * currently `echo DATABASE_URL=postgres://username:password@localhost/artifact > .env` has to be run to save the username/password and database address. This doesn't seem optimal, but I don't know how it could be improved. 
  * must run `diesel migration run` to set up the database with the test_name table

* File structure -- where should the files for this go?
  * a tracker module?
  * currently the files are kind of all over the place

First, the question. Right now this is a `bin`. If later I wanted to provide an API for devs to use, is it possible it could be both a `lib` and a `bin` in the future?

If so, I could rename it something like `rst_app` in cargo. `rst_cmd` would also be fine, although it's a bit more than a cmd (will have a webui in the future).

The behavior I was going to do was display the path from the `{repo}` folder (same folder `.rsk` folder is in).

I think the correct route here is to have two behaviors:
- if `-l` is specified (long form), display the `git path`
- otherwise, display only the file name.

Does that make sense? Or should the `git path` always be displayed? I am torn.

1. We are already used to this behaviour with git
2. The user may have multiple files with the same name. So having this `git path` avoids conflicts and user mistakes. For example, I see that for `rsk` itself you have several `settings.rsk` files: at `reqs/settings.rsk` and at `reqs/core/settings.rsk`
3. If the user follows the best practices of your tutorial, the path from `{repo}` should not be very long. At least, `git path` will always be shorter than the whole path so it's always better.

Just to be sure we understand each other, what you mean by `git path` is 

```
reqs/purpose.rsk 
```

where `reqs` is child of `{repo}`
And we agree that this is much more clearer than

```
/home/username/some/long/path/{repo}/reqs/purpose.rsk

Also this would make implementing handlers look cleaner. Basically `/api/foo/` should do one thing, not different things based on what comes next.

1. `/api/draft/:id` looks good. I imagine you want this to be filtered based on what the requesting user is allowed to see. For example, a spectator will get the full replay, but a drafter in an ongoing draft will only get the history of the draft that they would have seen. (Needs #31 to be fixed.)
2. `/api/user/:id/drafts` -> `/api/alldrafts`. I'm not convinced there's a use case for a user would asking about what drafts are available on behalf of another user, so specifying a user id is unnecessary. I can be talked into `/api/draftlist` or `/api/drafts` or something similar.
3. `/api/draft/:draftId/user/:userId/picks`. Why do we need this at all? Is this just a subset of `/api/draft/:id`?
4. `/api/draft/:draftId/user/:userId/pickCard` -> `/api/pick`. I'll start passing card ids to the client in `/api/draft/:id` and you can just send me the card id to be picked.

The client wants the data. I think we can reduce the `cards` table in the db from this:
```
CREATE TABLE cards(
  id integer primary key autoincrement,
  pack number,
  edition text,
  number text,
  tags text,
  name text,
  faceup number default false,
  original_pack number,
  modified number default 0,
  mtgo string,
  cmc number,
  type string,
  color string);
```
to this:
```
CREATE TABLE cards(
  id integer primary key autoincrement,
  pack number,
  original_pack number,
  card_info text);
```
where `card_info` is a JSON blob we blindly pass to the client.

For standard drafts, the draft creation script will need to know some of that data:
- power level rating
- color
- color identity

I can imagine that list expanding if we need more data for heuristics, like we would need to know card types to detect Legendary Creature cards for the Legendary Creature card slot in DOM drafts.

The Scryfall JSON blob that their API returns is quite large and contains a lot of data we don't care about and will never care about. Similarly, we need to add additional fields like power level rating to our JSON. We should decide if we're going to use their JSON format but delete fields we don't want or if we're going to go with our own format. The former is probably easier.",NA,https://api.github.com/repos/walkingeyerobot/r38/issues/101/comments,https://github.com/walkingeyerobot/r38/issues/101#issuecomment-629719516,https://api.github.com/repos/walkingeyerobot/r38/issues/101

It's going to take me a bit to review. I think we want to remove the Google auth stuff ASAP, but we do need some sort of migration plan. I don't mind matching manually; we only have 18 users right now, so manual migration is fine.

The users table needs to be redone. Off the top of my head, we need a sqlite id, whatever discord token or id they give us, discord user id for ping purposes (right now I populate this manually), mtgo user name for naming .dek exports. We can drop email (not necessary), slack (not going to be used anymore), and webhook (can move the to an environmental variable) fields. Maybe not picture; we might want that.

Maybe we rename the existing users table and make a new one. Start the indexing at 20 instead of 1. Have users log in like it's a fresh system. Update ids manually to match the old ones.

player A has 2 packs, the first containing 2 cards and the second containing 1 card. player A picks one from the first pack, passing the now-1-card-pack to player B. The system auto-picks the last card for player A from their second pack, but player B's new pack is never auto-picked from.

A check needs to be made before the system checks to see if an alert needs to be sent: after any pick, if **any** player has their next pack that only has a single card in it, do that pick for them

But, the compiler shouldn't distinguish `type specifier` to `identifier` when it is doing preprocessing, right? So `long` of `(long)1.2` should be treated as an `identifier`, and the standard says: an `identifier` in condition expression of control directive after expansion should be treated as `0`, which results in this problem here.

gcc gets right, but I doubt if it's standard, here I found the specifications in C11 standard [6.10.1.4] :

这么做的原因和TokenSequence的实现有关：

``` cpp
struct TokenSequence {

  TokenList::iterator begin_;

}
```

代表TokenList上面的一个区间。你可以将TokenSequence看做某种""区间指针""。当传值是，表示函数不会修改此区间。但是不修改指针不代表不修改指针指向的变量。当然，可以用const reference。但是同时另一些函数会在内部修改这个指针区间，这样，我得在这样的函数内部再copy一次。所以为了统一，对于不修改区间本身的函数，我统一进行传值了。

预处理器部分本身写起来是很恶心的，调试也很困难。如果你想理清脉络，可以先看这里的伪代码算法https://github.com/wgtdkp/wgtcc/blob/master/doc/cpp.algo.pdf

假设现在有3个同名的头文件math.h, 它们被找到的顺序是：
1. /foo/math.h
2. /bar/math.h
3. /hello/math.h

现在/bar/math.h这个文件，如果想包含/hello/math.h,那么他只要写:

``` c
#include_next ""math.h""
```

按照你的理解， 这会导致这个预处理器找到/bar/math.h(第一个找到的是/foo/math.h), 于是无限循环。

题外话， 这三个头文件被搜索到的顺序，隐含的意义是：/foo/math.h 应当是/bar/math.h 的某种扩充或修正， /bar/math.h 则是/hello/math.h的扩充。这种情况下，应该总是/foo/math.h include_next ""math.h"" 去把/bar/math.h 包含进来，而/bar/math.h 同样用include_next 去把/hello/math.h 包含进来。这样.c文件就只需要简单的include ""math.h"" 了。

cpp.cc代码中的continue，就是为了跳过/foo/math.h，直到找到/bar/math.h(也就是自身) :)
希望你理解了～～

当然，SearchFile()这样简单的reverse头文件目录的搜索顺序是不对的。应该仅仅是调整库头文件目录和用户头文件目录之间的顺序。。。

I took a peek at the code and there is an `activate` method (I think one is required).

To reproduce this issue, you will need to test using the feature implemented by https://github.com/ymotongpoo/vsc-licenser/pull/65 , and select Custom license header.

Steps to reproduce:
Sample project for testing:
[licenser_test.zip](https://github.com/ymotongpoo/vsc-licenser/files/5525192/licenser_test.zip)

1. Prepare a few shell scripts with shebang in the first line, like these ones
test.sh
```
#! /usr/bin/bash
echo ""This is a test script""
```
and test2.sh,
```
#! /usr/bin/bash
echo ""This is another test script""
```
Put these two files under a folder named scripts.

2. Prepare a .vscode/settings.json like this under the workspace:
```
{
    ""licenser.projectName"": ""Test Project"",
    ""licenser.license"": ""Custom"",
    ""licenser.customHeader"": ""\n@PROJECT@\nFile Name: @FILE@\nCopyright @YEAR@ Do whatever you want with this one.""
}
```

3. Open this folder with VS Code, open script/test.sh, then right click script folder, then click ""lincenser: Insert license headers to content"",

The correct output should be:
test.sh
```
#! /usr/bin/bash
# 
# Test Project
# File Name: test.sh
# Copyright 2020 Do whatever you want with this one.
# 

echo ""This is a test script""

```
test2.sh
```
#! /usr/bin/bash
# 
# Test Project
# File Name: test2.sh
# Copyright 2020 Do whatever you want with this one.
# 

echo ""This is another test script""

```

However, with current solution, the output would be:
test.sh
```
# 
# Test Project
# File Name: test.sh
# Copyright 2020 Do whatever you want with this one.
# 

#! /usr/bin/bash
echo ""This is a test script""

```
test2.sh
```
# 
# Test Project
# File Name: test.sh
# Copyright 2020 Do whatever you want with this one.
# 

#! /usr/bin/bash
echo ""This is another test script""

```

And if header is inserted from command palette, the output matches the correct ones.

Result from current solution:

As far as I read your comment, this is not a feature request but a bug, because this extension changes the comment notation based on the file extension.
