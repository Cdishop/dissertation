<ul>
<li>Increased the aggressiveness of <a href=""https://github.com/google/guava/releases/tag/v30.1"">Guava 30.1</a>'s warning log message for running <code>guava-android</code> under a Java 7 VM. (Android VMs are unaffected.) If the warning <em>itself</em> causes you trouble, you can eliminate it by silencing the logger for <code>com.google.common.base.Preconditions</code> (which is used <em>only</em> for this warning). This warning prepares for <a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/google/guava/issues/5269"">removing support for Java 7 in 2021</a>. Please report any problems. We have tried to make the warning as safe as possible, but anytime a common library logs, especially as aggressively as we do in this new release, there is the potential for <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/41017717/28465""><code>NullPointerException</code></a> or even <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/48009613/28465"">deadlock</a>. (To be clear, Guava will not log under Java 8 or Android, but it will under Java 7.) (00c25e9b11)</li>
<li><code>cache</code>: Fixed compatibility between <code>asMap().compute(...)</code> and a load. (42bf4f4eb7)</li>
<li><code>cache</code>: Added <code>@CheckReturnValue</code> to some APIs. (a5ef129ffc)</li>
<li><code>collect</code>: Added <code>@DoNotCall</code> to the mutator methods on immutable types (6ae9532d11)</li>

I'm working on the migration to Java 11 of a [project][10] that uses Jung heavily. I've stumbled to some code that extends `AbstractPopupGraphMousePlugin` and depends on 
`AbstractGraphMousePlugin`. the pop-up plugins uses `MouseEvent.BUTTON3_MASK`, while its super-class uses `MouseEvent.getModifiers()` (in `checkModifiers()`). Both those elements have been deprecated in Java 9 and I'm concerned they'll be removed sooner than later.

My questions is: Are there plans to upgrade Jung? Do you have a timeline for it?

First, thanks for the great library!

Jung 2.1.1 was released on Sep 7, 2016 and since then a lot of new code was committed. For a new project, is it preferable to stick to the official 2.1.1 release or use the snapshot version?
(for production usage, where quality is important).

Also, are there any plans for the next official release?

I am working on a project in which a network is to be made. The only problem is that I encounter nodes with parallel edges such that two edge can carry different type of information. For example, if A and B are two nodes, it is possible that these are connected by two edges, say e1 & e2, where e1 has a weight ""21.5 degrees (direction)"" and e2 has a weight ""3.0 knots"".

I believe the root of the issue is that `SparseGraph.removeEdge()` is not thread-safe. In the case of the 2nd `NullPointerException` at `edu.uci.ics.jung.visualization.renderers.BasicEdgeRenderer.paintEdge(BasicEdgeRenderer.java:51)`, the event dispatch thread has the `BasicEdgeRenderer` iterate through the edges in the graph to render them, while my own thread is busy removing edges. 

Is this a bug, and/or is there a workaround to avoid such `NullPointerExceptions`?

the implementation of jung.algorithms.scoring.BetweennessCentrality seems to be wrong.
Initially, I came across this because I was so surprised that the JUNG implementation is so much faster than my own.

Tested with this graph: 
http://www.cs.utah.edu/~lifeifei/research/tpq/OL.cedge
(Edge list of Edge ID, Start Node ID, End Node ID, L2 Distance)
I used the L2 distance as an edge length.

I compared the vertex betweenness of JUNG with the betweenness that I get with my own implementation and then compared both with the implementation of Visone, a graphical graph tool from the chair of research of Ulrik Brandes (the creator of that particular betweenness algorithm in the first place). http://www.visone.info/html/download.html

Simply looking at node 0 shows a huge difference.
JUNG returns a betweenness of 0.0, my implementation and the one of Visone returns 38,924.

I'm using version 2.2.1 and have some issues with ""setNodeLabelFunction"" once the network uses a custom object as its node (not String but MyNode). The problem is the node label doesn't show up!
I've prepared a minimal demo code here. If you run it, you'll see the ""setNodeToolTipFunction"" works but ""setNodeLabelFunction"" doesn't. Even though both of them use the same function as input.

1. Error messages are (in my opinion) easier to understand.
For example, we currently have messages like
```
Found 1 non-complying files, failing build (validateOnly is true)
```
which aren't terribly informative - they don't explain _which_ files no longer comply and _why_, they don't explain _how_ to fix the problem, and the messages easily get lost in the noise of other Maven logging messages.
But with Spotless, we'd have messages like
```
The following files had format violations:
src\main\java\edu\uci\ics\jung\graph\DelegateCTree.java
@@ -203,8 +203,7 @@
··@Override
··public·boolean·removeNode(N·node)·{
····checkNotNull(node,·""node"");
-····if·(!nodes()
-········.contains(node))·{
+····if·(!nodes().contains(node))·{
······return·false;
····}
····for·(N·nodeToRemove·:·Graphs.reachableNodes(delegate,·node))·{
Run 'mvn spotless:apply' to fix these violations.
```
which AFAICT fix the problems above rather nicely.

2. We can easily adopt formatters other than google-java-format in the future, such as a formatter which checks that files have license headers that follow a certain template. (This seems useful or even important for us, since currently the license headers in JUNG's source files are a bit inconsistent.)

3. If Spotless's Maven plugin ever exposes a [""padded cell""](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/blob/master/PADDEDCELL.md) option in the future (currently only Spotless's Gradle plugin exposes such an option), and if we ever discover that google-java-format or another formatter has bugs which prevent it from producing consistent results (idempotency bugs), then we can use ""padded cell"" in the short-term to ensure that that formatter continues producing consistent results until the respective bug is fixed.",NA,TRUE,https://api.github.com/repos/jrtom/jung,https://api.github.com/repos/jrtom/jung/issues/198/labels{/name},https://api.github.com/repos/jrtom/jung/issues/198/comments,https://api.github.com/repos/jrtom/jung/issues/198/events,https://github.com/jrtom/jung/pull/198,https://api.github.com/repos/jrtom/jung/pulls/198

1. We should prefer JUnit Jupiter API's [`assertThrows`](http://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/api/org/junit/jupiter/api/Assertions.html#assertThrows-java.lang.Class-org.junit.jupiter.api.function.Executable-) over the `try..fail..catch` idiom
2. We might want to use [`assertAll`](http://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/api/org/junit/jupiter/api/Assertions.html#assertAll-org.junit.jupiter.api.function.Executable...-) over just writing assertions one line after another, so that all potential assertion errors can be gathered and thrown together as one exception for easier debugging.
3. We'll have to use [`assertTimeout`](http://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/api/org/junit/jupiter/api/Assertions.html#assertTimeout-java.time.Duration-org.junit.jupiter.api.function.Executable-) or [`assertTimeoutPreemptively`](http://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/api/org/junit/jupiter/api/Assertions.html#assertTimeoutPreemptively-java.time.Duration-org.junit.jupiter.api.function.Executable-) where we would have used `@Test(timeout=...)` or `@Rule public Timeout timeout = ...`

5. And finally, if we use any custom `@Rule`s or `@Runner`s, we will need to find alternative extensions for JUnit Jupiter/5.

I have a couple of proposed solutions.

Fundamentally, we have a `Set` of nodes (from the graph) and you have a `Function` that you can apply to an element to get its value.  You just need a way to combine them, using a live read of the graph each time.

Option (1): Guava's [`Maps.asMap(Set, Function)`](http://google.github.io/guava/releases/21.0/api/docs/com/google/common/collect/Maps.html#asMap-java.util.Set-com.google.common.base.Function-)

This gives you a map that's based on a live view of the graph nodes.  Code would look something like:

```
default public  Map<N, Point> getLocations() {
  return Maps.asMap(getGraph().nodes(), LayoutModel::get); 
}
```

and that should do what you want, i.e., rely on the `Graph` as the source of truth.

`Maps.asMap` operates on a Guava `Function`, rather than a Java 8 `Function`, which might present a minor problem, but I think we could work it out.

Option (2): Stream

```
default public  Map<N, Point> getLocations() {
  return getGraph().nodes().stream().collect(Function.identity(), LayoutModel::get); 
}
```

I _think_ that this also treats the nodes of the graph as a live view, but I'm less familiar with the `Stream` idiom.  @jbduncan could probably comment on whether this would work as hoped.  :)

However, having said this, it's likely that my opinion will change when I finally get my copy of Effective Java 3rd Edition, which I understand has a new section on the judicious use of Streams (compared to 2nd Edition).

This happens when a LayoutModel initializer starts with all points at the same location, as when the
LayoutModel initializer has all points at the origin. This change has the BHQT just sum the masses in that case.
Also made the BHQD not dependent on the LayoutModel instance as part of its state.
Added unit tests for BHQT

It has now been integrated into new versions of SpringLayoutAlgorithm and FRLayoutAlgorithm. 

In jung-samples, there is a BarnesHutVisualizer that draws the 'node' locations, in addition to the force vectors that are influenced by the location of nodes. You can clear the display and click to add new points. The Graph points are labeled with their names and the force vector points (from the center of a quad to the center of mass) is a red line terminating with a circle and the name 'force' instead of the node name. If you read up on BarnesHut, I think you will 'get it' pretty quickly. 

Other changes (from the last PR but backed up in this branch) are:
Point has factory methods 
PolarPoint was made to be like Point (factory methods and immutable)
Transformers may take a (x,y) in addition to a Point2D
Some unused classes were removed.





Made PolarPoint immutable with Factory methods so it is more like Point

jrtom,jung,https://api.github.com/repos/jrtom/jung/issues/169,284621921,MDU6SXNzdWUyODQ2MjE5MjE=,169,Consider allowing `MutableCTree#putEdge` to indirectly change the root of the tree,2482228,open,FALSE,NA,NA,10,2017-12-26T23:24:09Z,2017-12-31T20:00:51Z,NA,CONTRIBUTOR,NA,"Currently, if one is given a `CTree` like the following,
```java
MutableCTree tree = TreeBuilder.builder().build();
tree.putEdge(""b"", ""c"");
```

then if one tries to add the following edge,
```java
tree.putEdge(""a"", ""b"");
```

then it throws an `IllegalArgumentException`, because it tries to implicitly change the root from ""b"" to ""a"", and yet the method doesn't allow it.

I personally found this to be surprising behaviour when implementing tests for https://github.com/jrtom/jung/issues/83, as it means when I try to test that the two following pieces of code do the same thing,

```java
tree.putEdge(""b"", ""c"");
tree.putEdge(""a"", ""b"");

. . .

tree.putEdge(""a"", ""b"");
tree.putEdge(""b"", ""c"");
```

it throws an exception, but not for the reason that I expected.

I'd also expect users to be surprised by this behaviour. IMO, if one wants to prevent changing the root of a tree when adding new edges to it, then they should use a function like this:
```java
public static boolean putEdgeUnlessRootWouldChange(MutableCTree<N> tree, N nodeU, N nodeV) {
  if (tree.root().isPresent() && tree.root().get().equals(nodeV)) {
    // do something appropriate here: throw exception, return false, etc.
  } else {
    return tree.putEdge(nodeU, nodeV);
  }
}

It has an R-Tree and R*-Tree in use for Nodes and Edges. The RTree.java class has a link to a paper that describes how they work.
This code also changes all V to N, Vertex to Node, and Transformer to Function. All Applet references are also gone.

Let me know what you think and we can discuss this as a contribution to JUNG.

Cheers.

AFAICT, we have a few options:
1. Rename `TreeUtils` to `Trees` and `Graphs` to `MoreGraphs`.

    **Pros**:
    a. `TreeUtils` and `Graphs` would be more self-consistent, reducing surprise for new users.
    b. Guava naming conventions would be followed, reducing surprise for those already using Guava.
    c. Users wouldn't be forced to write `edu.uci.ics.jung.graph.util.Graphs` or `com.google.common.graph.Graphs` to use both `Graphs` classes in the same source file.

    **Cons**:
    a. Existing users may be surprised by this change.
    b. It would be backwards incompatible.

2. Rename `Graphs` to `GraphUtils`.

    b. Users wouldn't be forced to write `edu.uci.ics.jung.graph.util.Graphs` or `com.google.common.graph.Graphs` to use both `Graphs` classes in the same source file.

    **Cons**:
    a. Existing users may be surprised by this change.
    b. It would be backwards incompatible.
    c. Users coming over from Guava would be surprised by the use of ""*Utils"" instead of ""*s"" for utility classes pertaining to graph data structures.

3. Do nothing.
    **Pro**:
    a. No extra changes on our part.

    **Con**:
    b. New users and users coming from Guava would be surprised by the naming inconsistency.

IMO, option (1) is the best, as it aligns our naming conventions closer to Guava's, and I consider JUNG 3.0 to be an extension to `com.google.common.graph`.

I've been doing quite a bit of work with Spatial Data Structures in JUNG. My early experiments were with a simple Grid structure, and then with a QuadTree. In both cases, they were applied at the LayoutModel level as special subclasses. These structures dealt only with point data (where the LayoutModel places the nodes). The LayoutModel knows nothing about the actual shapes for nodes, and knows only that an edge connects two of its node points. 

Next, I made an R-Tree. The R-Tree deals with the actual rectangular bounds of graph elements: shaped nodes and shaped edges. As such, it cannot be placed in the Model side (LayoutModel and VisualizationModel) side of JUNG, because the classes that assign the shapes to nodes and edges exist in the VisualizationServer (parent interface of VisualizationViewer)... the View side.

I implemented the R-Tree Spatial data structure on the View side as a filter for actions like find the picked node/edge, find the closest node/edge. It made the most sense to have one R-Tree for Edge shapes and one for Node shapes.

The R-Tree code is a challenge to write, because there is high complexity and several interesting edge cases. That is where most of my time has been spent.

While working with this, it occurred to me that when a graph layout is very active (like the prerelax stage of a layout algorithm or even during the relax phase of something like our SpringLayoutAlgorithm, it is not efficient to repeatedly update the spatial data structure while all that motion is happening during the 'steps' of the relax phase. Even in the case where a node is being mouse-dragged to a new location, it makes more sense to update the spatial data structure only after the user stops dragging the node and not at every step of the way. That eliminates a lot of unnecessary and competing compute cycles.

I designed the SpatialRTree so that it can either be 'active' or 'not-active'. When it is switched to 'active', it builds the spatial structure tree. During the time it is 'inactive', requests from user's mouse interaction for tool-tips or picking fall back on an O(N) approach. This seems like a good trade-off. While the R-Tree is active, requests (using the mouse pointer) for nodes during picking and when finding 'tool-tip' popup texts are quite fast, as the correct node or edge is found in O(logN) time instead of O(N). This matters a lot more as N becomes large.

[The idea would be to] put all visualization related property settings in one place, something like `VisualizationViewUI.java`, which would allow a user to provide a jung.properties file with contents something like this:

```
jung.nodeColor=0x00FFF0
jung.pickedNodeColor=0x0000FF
jung.defaultEdgeShape=CUBIC_CURVE
jung.spatialSupport=GRID
jung.nodeLabelPosition=SW
jung.nodeShape=SQUARE
jung.nodeSize=12
jung.pickedEdgeColor=0x005555
```

`VisualizationViewerUI` would set any user-specified properties and fall back on default values for all of them.

Programmatic settings could still be achieved by doing something like this:

    System.setProperty(PICKED_NODE_COLOR, ""0x110000"")

or

    System.setProperty(PICKED_NODE_COLOR, Color.red.getRGB().toString());

instead of

    vv.getRenderContext().setVertexFillPaintTransformer(
        new PickableVertexPaintTransformer(vv.getPickedVertexState(), Color.red, Color.yellow)

Issues to be resolved would include:
1. Is this something we want to do?  Arguably most users are fine with picking their properties once, and with rebuilding their code if they change them (since I don't think that anyone has ever asked for this capability).
Put more clearly: what specific problem would we be trying to solve by providing this kind of capability, and what fraction of our users would we expect it to help?
1. Are we talking about a way of overriding defaults at program launch time, or would we expect changes in the properties file to be picked up on the fly?
1. What properties would be specifiable in this way?  Node and edge shape/color/stroke?  Layout algorithms?  Dimensions?  More?
1. Are there any existing conventions (specifically as regards managing common types such as Color, Shape, and Stroke) that we would want to incorporate?
1. Where and how would we want to specify default values?  (Right now it's basically in the code in `PluggableRendererContext`, but if we want to enable a big flat file that sets a bunch of properties, it might be helpful for users to be able to easily check for  
1. Would we want to namespace any of this more than with just a ""jung"" prefix?
1. How would this integrate with our existing programmatic mechanisms?  Presumably we would still want to have a way of programmatically specifying all the things that can be currently specified in this way.
    * Is this something that could, or should, be built on top of JUNG without changing the existing code?  (Does it even need to be part of JUNG per se?)
1. How would we handle bad property specifications?  Ignore them and use the default?  Log a warning?  Throw?

In my opinion, we should not be providing any defaults: if users want to create a visualization, they need to specify how big it should be.  Ideally, this should be baked into how the visualization is created, but it may be necessary or appropriate to add Preconditions checks to validate that dimensions have been set.

This is partially a matter of practicality: 600x600 is a much smaller piece of screen real estate than it used to be when JUNG was created (because pixels are a lot smaller).  If we were to continue to have a default, we might well want to change it to be a reasonable size.  However, as long as we have a default, users may depend on that default being a specific size.

I'm attempting to map process flows. My graphs are directed graphs with cycles. All have a single start node and a single end node, with linear flows containing branching and cycles between.  

For clear presentation, I need the layout to reflect the logical flows - that is, I need the arrows to point in the same direction, with backward-facing arrows only when there is a cycle back to a prior step. This link shows a (cheesy) [example of the basic idea]( http://www.conceptdraw.com/How-To-Guide/picture/Flowchart-Project-Management-Life-Cycle.png).

[Edit] I suspect it would be easy enough to specify the Y coordinates for each node (assuming the graph flows top-down) but the horizontal spacing would have to depend on the width of the plot at it's widest point. and somehow place nodes at a particular level near the nodes above and below that it is connected to. [End Edit], 

My questions:

- Do you know of any existing layouts for this?
- If I were to attempt to create one, are there any layout algorithms in Jung that would serve as an ideal starting place? 
- Does creating such a layout seem very difficult? :)

Thanks again for all your hard work.

For now, it is used only in the visualization system to prevent rendering of elements that are not visible. The next step is to move most of the quadtree code to jung-algorithms and create a node accessor better than RadiusNetworkNodeAccessor (which does an O(N) pythagorean theorem  measure of distance). The quadtree version will do an O(logN) search for nodes in nearby cells, and if there is only one, not even measure distance, If there is more than one, it will calculate distance for only a few nodes. This should also enable improvement for some layout algorithms that evaluate spatial proximity.

These methods aren't currently being used anywhere in JUNG, and it's not clear to me that they're useful outside of JUNG.

Pros for removing these methods:
1. Codebase would be less cluttered.
2. One thing less to test.

Cons:
1. These methods may be being used by JUNG 2.x users (since they are public API, as pointed out by @jrtom [here](https://github.com/jrtom/jung/pull/143#issuecomment-344032673)), in which case we should likely move the methods out of the `utils` package (which may become an `internals` package, as discussed in https://github.com/jrtom/jung/issues/94) and into a more dedicated class elsewhere.

It also occurs to me that the name of the methods aren't so user friendly. One could Google what Kullback-Leibler divergence is, but I personally find the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback%E2%80%93Leibler_divergence) too technical.

However, they don't do so in a very intelligent fashion: when we've calculated the shortest path/distance from A to C, and the path passes through B, we already know the shortest path/distance from B to C also, but we don't store it in such a way as to be able to take advantage of this.

This is known to be a problem in practice; one user has reported that with a graph of ~10k nodes and 100k edges, after a number of calls for path lengths, there are ~2M distances being stored.  :(

The task here is to come up with a better representation of the cached distances/paths that is more compact.  Offhand I'd guess that this can be done in O(m + n) space (i.e., basically the size of the input graph), or perhaps O(n^2); what we have now looks more like O(mn).

This is a second attempt (following #87) to format the JUNG code base with google-java-format. Note however that it's a work-in-progress, for reasons explained in the commit message, which I've copied and pasted below.

```
The Maven plugin https://github.com/coveo/fmt-maven-plugin was used
to do this job. Those files which are still in the process of being
removed or otherwise dealt with for JUNG 3.0 (as described in
https://github.com/jrtom/jung/pull/87) have been left alone to
prevent unnecessary work and merging problems.

The formatting has not yet been tweaked in places where
google-java-format itself cannot automatically do so but which would
be beneficial for readability, like:
1. Removing superfluous empty lines at the start and end of method
   bodies.
2. Adding braces to if, for and while statements.

The formatting has also not been checked to see if javadocs have been
adversely affected.

Two classes come to mind:

1. `edu.uci.ics.jung.algorithms.util.BasicMapEntry`: it seems that this class is just a simple implementation of `Map.Entry` and is only used by `DijkstraDistance`, so it looks to be just an implementation detail, despite it being a `public` type. In this case, it could simply be replaced with `AbstractMap.SimpleImmutableEntry` or Guava's `Maps.immutableEntry()`.
2. `edu.uci.ics.jung.algorithms.util.MaxBinaryHeap`: this seems like a potentially generally useful collection class. Might it be worth moving into its own separate package e.g. `edu.uci.ics.jung.collect`, and perhaps into its own module (jung-collect)?

There may very well be other classes like these two that deserve this sort of attention as well.

One possible way of treating such classes, if we still find them useful, would be to move them into appropriate `internal` subpackages, and state in the README.md or elsewhere that all classes in subpackages with the name `internal` are implementation details and may go away in future releases.

Now, to the point that this issue is *actually* about: It's comparatively minor, but may become relevant for large and/or very dynamic graphs: In `addEdge` and `addVertex` of https://github.com/jrtom/jung/blob/common.graph/jung-api/src/main/java/edu/uci/ics/jung/graph/ObservableNetwork.java#L67 , the event is generated even if it is not used. Changing

    if (state) { ... }

to 

    if (state && !listenerList.isEmpty()) { ... }

would avoid the creation of garbage events.

---

Beyond that, I could point out (many) other minor issues, like

- The event class should extend `EventObject`
- The event class could be `final`
- The fields could be `final` 
- ...
- General: Missing `@Override` annotations in some classes
- Broken indentation 

but I just had a short glance at the code, and this sort of nitpicking may not be appropriate....

This propagates though `buildTree()` and `calculateDimensionX()` in TreeLayout, eventually resulting in a NullPointerException (see test).

If this is indeed the intended behavior of `getRoots()` then it becomes necessary to filter out null roots recieved in `buildTree()`.  For example:

    Collection<V> roots = new ArrayList<V>();
    for (V v : TreeUtils.getRoots(graph)) {
        if (v != null)
            roots.add(v);
    }

BalloonLayout also relys on getRoots(), and also requires the same sort of filtering to avoid an exception.

Alternately, one could modify `getRoots()` to only return legitimate root vertices.  This may be the more elegant solution, but it does change the public API.

Please comment if you have thoughts on this subject.

As it currently stands in JUNG 2.x, the `Layout<V, E>` interface has two type parameters: `V` for nodes and `E` for edges.

However, `Layout` doesn't actually operate on anything relating to edges; it only specifies node positions.  So, with one exception, there's nothing about it that should require an edge type parameter.

The catch is that `Layout` also provides a `getGraph()` method that returns the graph whose node positions are specified by the `Layout`.  This is the reason why it's historically needed the `E` parameter: so that the type returned by `getGraph()` could be fully parameterized as a `Graph<V, E>`.

JUNG 3.0 will replace the JUNG graph types with Guava's `common.graph` types: `Graph<N>`, `ValueGraph<N, V>`, and `Network<N, E>`.  `Network` has an `asGraph()` method which returns a `Graph<N>` (and `ValueGraph<N, V>` likely will have `asGraph()` as well once the dust settles).

For the moment, the visualization system will probably still operate on `Network`s (which are the closest analog to the JUNG 2.x `Graph` type).  But we'd like to leave the door open for being able to use this visualization system to handle other graph types.

To sum up: `Layout` needs `N` for actually laying out nodes, but it only needs an edge type parameter (`E` or `V`)  in order to be able to return a fully-specified `Network` or `ValueGraph`.

I see a few possibilities; there may be others.

(1) `Layout` keeps an edge type parameter, and supports hanging onto (and providing) a reference to its graph:
 (1a) for `Network` only, i.e., `getGraph()` returns `Network` (status quo, essentially)
 (1b) for `Graph`, `ValueGraph`, and `Network` (separate `getGraph()`, `getValueGraph()`, `getNetwork()` methods, only one of which will work for any given layout instance)

(I thought about (1c), which would introduce a generic graph type, something like `Layout<G<N, E> extends Object, N, E>`, such that `Layout::getGraph()` would return `G`, but that appears to break down for `Graph<N>`.)

(2) `Layout` gets rid of its edge type parameter and no longer provides a `getGraph()` method.
Instead of taking a graph as its input, it would take a `Set<N>` (or possibly an `Iterable<N>`).

(3) Create separate subtypes of `Layout`: `NetworkLayout`, `GraphLayout`, etc.  These then would each provide their own `getGraph()` methods with appropriate return types.  (You might also want a convenience method to provide the type, so as to help the user avoid repeated `instanceof` calls.)


(1a) works but doesn't get us any closer to resolving the underlying issue that we'd like to support other graph types for visualization.

(1b) would be kind of a mess: you'd have to have two methods for each supported graph type (one for specifying the graph in the construction and one for providing it), plus (perhaps) an extra convenience method to tell you which type of graph was actually being operated on (so you'd know which query method to call).

(2) works, but at the cost of refactoring the visualization system so that the layout isn't the object that's responsible for providing the graph reference as needed.  It also means that the connection between the layout and the graph would be lost, which seems unfortunate.

(3) works, but feels like it makes the layout type more complex than I'd like (and the visualization system, likewise).


I'm leaning towards (2) at the moment, but I'm open to other ideas, and I'd be interested to know what other people think.

At the same time I took the opportunity to make some speed improvements under the hood. The previous implementation, when trying to create new edges, selected a potential node uniformly at random then compared nextDouble() to the attachment probability of this node. Whilst this has a small memory footprint and works well for small graphs it has scalability issues and larger graphs would take a long time to generate as the potential nodes could be selected and rejected many times for each successful choice.

With the inclusion of WeightedChoice in the JUNG util package this was the perfect candidate for replacing the previous method and the implementation instead now works out the correct weighted probabilities of attaching to each node and then simply makes choices for the correct number of edges needed within the timestep.

The speedup is drastic as can be seen below:

| Nodes | Old Impl. (sec) | New Impl. (sec) | Speedup (%) |
| --: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 1000 | 1.13 | 0.99 | 12% |

The reimplementation offers drastic speedups as well as fixing the previous bug and I hope it's of an acceptable quality that it might be included!

Additionally, I have enhanced and extended the Barabasi-Albert JUnit tests to test a number of new things (graph generation for different types, rough distribution checks) to hopefully ensure further changes are compliant.

This code doesn't seem to be used anywhere except in the Kleinberg generator but within that it is used to calculate the distance metric between nodes for making the long-distance connections. This means that the probabilities assigned to the nodes is incorrect as the nodes are thought to be potentially much further away than they are.

It also means that it is possible for the vertices to have self-loops/duplicate attempted edges as the check to prevent this relies on the distance between the nodes.

I'm using Gephi to debug my generated graphs. Therefore I export the graph to the GraphML format with the GraphMLWriter. It would be nice if each data key can get an attribute type. Gephi uses these attribute types for sorting and other purposes.

Example current export:

```
<?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?>
<graphml [...]>
  <key id=""weight"" for=""node"">
    <desc>Weight</desc>
    <default></default>
  </key>
  [...]

<?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?>

  <key id=""weight"" for=""node"" attr.type=""double"">

Problem: EditingGraphMousePlugin::mousePressed checks to see if the underlying graph (in my case, the observer) is Directed, and if not the edge type is set to UNDIRECTED. However, UNDIRECTED edges cannot be added to my delegate graph.

Possible Solution 1: EditingGraphMousePlugin should check if the underlying graph is actually an observer, and if so, use it's delegate to determine edge type.

Possible Solution 2: EditingGraphMousePlugin should delegate to EdgeSupport to determine edge types if possible.

For my own project, I'm currently working around this by excluding JUnit 3.8.1 from my project's transitive deps as follows:

``` gradle

It basically creates a Forest, fills the Forest (code not shown), and uses a default TreeLayout to visualize it in a BasicVisualizationServer. version 2.0.1 worked fine, after updating at 2.1 it gives me a NullPointerException.

After a bit of debug I discovered that the PluggableRenderContext that vv uses as a default doesn't initialize the two PickedState, vetrtex and edge, and it hangs exactly on the call to the the vertexPickedState.

In short, the PluggableRenderContext was previously (in 2.0.1) initalised at field declaration. Now in 2.1 intialisation has been relocated to the constructors.

Since several of these constructors call a main one, any data set into PluggableRenderContext by the primary constructor is overridden.

Ultimately, the NPE occurs later at BasicVertexLabelRenderer#84 where the pickedVertexState in PluggableRenderContext has been nulled.

Whilst it is noted in the docs that a Lagrangian smoothed version of the original formula is used I believe this still has the issues contained.

The docs state that the original formula proposed by Barabasi and Albert is p(v) = deg(v)/|E| but this is incorrect. The original formula is p(v) = deg(v)/(sum deg(v) for all v) which, via the Handshake Lemma, becomes p(v) = deg(v)/2|E|. This scaling means the probabilities no longer sum to 1 over all vertices.

Similarly, the equation actually utilised has the same issue; whilst the numerator uses degree the denominator uses |E| which once again means that the numerator is scaled compared to the denominator and produces total probabilities exceeding 1.

Unless I'm missing something, this is problematic. Whilst it might still produce graphs exhibiting scale-free properties I cannot state this for sure.

What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Run edu.uci.ics.jung.samples.UnicodeLabelDemo sample
2. Replace current vv.setVertexToolTipTransformer() method with 
vv.setVertexToolTipTransformer(new UnicodeVertexStringer<Integer>(v));

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
1) Expected text on the label and the tooltip for China flag: ""欢迎使用  
JUNG!"" 
2) Expected text on the label and the tooltip for  Japan flag: 
""JUNGへょぅこそ!""

What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?
JUNG2 (2.0.1) Windows XP SP3 with JRE 1.6.0_31

Please provide any additional information below.

I suspect that Swing JToolTip in JUNG viewer is set with the default Swing font 
that doesn't support all Unicode characters. The best is to expose a way for 
JUNG to change the font used in the tooltip.

Decimal separators are different in different countries, e.g. comma instead of 
a dot.
String.format uses default locale whereas load() method uses 
Double.parseDouble() which can't cope with commas.

### Release Notes

<details>
<summary>markedjs/marked</summary>

### [`v2.0.0`](https://togithub.com/markedjs/marked/releases/v2.0.0)

[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/markedjs/marked/compare/v1.2.9...v2.0.0)

##### Bug Fixes

-   Join adjacent inlineText tokens ([#&#8203;1926](https://togithub.com/markedjs/marked/issues/1926)) ([f848e77](https://togithub.com/markedjs/marked/commit/f848e7703956a6c37871432a7e128f51b1700aa0))
-   Total rework of Emphasis/Strong ([#&#8203;1864](https://togithub.com/markedjs/marked/issues/1864)) ([7293251](https://togithub.com/markedjs/marked/commit/7293251c438e3ee968970f7609f1a27f9007bccd))

##### BREAKING CHANGES

-   `em` and `strong` tokenizers have been merged into one `emStrong` tokenizer.
-   `code` and `text` tokenizers do not get passed all tokens as a second parameter.
-   No longer supporting IE 11. IE 11 may still work but we are not committed to making sure it works with every update. We still provide an es5 version in `lib/marked.js` but some pollyfills may be needed for IE 11 in the future.

### Release Notes

<details>
<summary>sindresorhus/meow</summary>

### [`v9.0.0`](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/meow/releases/v9.0.0)

[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/meow/compare/1d1b6abda2c76a199c653d7f6f1305f6944dd8ec...v9.0.0)

##### Breaking

-   Strictly validate flag config ([#&#8203;168](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/meow/issues/168))  [`1609709`](https://togithub.com/sindresorhus/meow/commit/1609709)
    This is a breaking change if you incorrectly used kebab-case format for flags (was never officially supported) in the `meow` config:

```diff
 meow(``, {
 	flags: {
-		'foo-bar': {
+		fooBar: {
 			type: 'boolean'
 		}
 	}
 });
```

Hi, 

since the last idea in #175 turned out to be relatively simple to implement, here's a try on it.  What do you think?

Nitpick: It includes a small change to the default behavior, too - expanding the ""rel"" filtering to all tags that are specified to support ""rel"" means that if someone really uses  `<a href=""foo"" rel=""prefetch"" >...` in their code that would now be ignored in the defaults. But since that is nonfunctional pointless HTML it's not specifically worrying me.   In a very strict interpretation of semantic versioning it could be considered a breaking change though - if that's the case I would roll it back to just apply to `link` tags.

<img width=""432"" alt=""Screenshot 2020-09-12 at 20 31 23"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8344688/93003491-130f5600-f537-11ea-9b2b-9f3d04cdc7a4.png"">

It may or may not be a broken link.

**Idea:** what if we improved the algorithm to slow down for `429` throttling domains and tackle all `429` links in a separate, second round, per-domain but slower? 

Imagine, our outgoing requests go as normal, respecting `--concurrency` value, but when it completes, it extracts all `429` errors, groups them per throttling domain, waits a bit, then slowly tackles each link let's say 1 query per second (or slower), concurrently, per-throttling domain.

## Currently...

For example, I've got 1042 links and 11 of them linking to Wikipedia. If I set `--concurrency` to satisfy Wikipedia, let's say 2 seconds per request, it will take 1042 × 2 / 60 = 34 minutes — unbearable, considering it's for 1% of the links!

Here's the workflow issue:
 * The page has a `<link rel=""canonical"" ...>` head information that points to the live production domain's absolute URL. That link is checked by linkinator, too - which is generally the right approach and a nice feature that all sorts of URLs are checked.
 * I'm adding a new page in a branch.  The branch is automatically built and tested on CI and deployed to a preview URL (vercel / netlify etc)
 * Test fails because it runs linkinator locally and the canonical tag points to the live domain which is not live because it's a preview.  That's a logical problem and not a technical, so it's not a bug but rather something I would love to be able to configure. 
 
Since the canonical link generation is not a potential source of broken links we would like to exclude it.

### Release Notes

<details>
<summary>nock/nock</summary>

### [`v13.0.0`](https://togithub.com/nock/nock/releases/v13.0.0)

[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/nock/nock/compare/v12.0.3...v13.0.0)

[Migration Guide](https://togithub.com/nock/nock/blob/75507727cf09a0b7bf0aa7ebdf3621952921b82e/migration_guides/migrating_to_13.md)

##### Breaking changes

1.  `Scope.log` has been removed. Use the `debug` library when [debugging](https://togithub.com/nock/nock#debugging) failed matches.

2.  `socketDelay` has been removed. Use [`delayConnection`](https://togithub.com/nock/nock#delay-the-connection) instead.

3.  `delay`, `delayConnection`, and `delayBody` are now setters instead of additive.

4.  [When recording](https://togithub.com/nock/nock#recording), skipping body matching using `*` is no longer supported by `nock.define`.
    Set the definition body to `undefined` instead.

5.  `ClientRequest.abort()` has been updated to align with Node's native behavior.
    This could be considered a feature, however, it created some subtle differences that are not backwards compatible. Refer to the migration guide for details.  

6.  Playback of a mocked responses will now never happen until the 'socket' event is emitted.

-   [#&#8203;4223](https://togithub.com/mochajs/mocha/issues/4223): The context object's `skip()` (`this.skip()`) in a ""before all"" (`before()`) hook will no longer execute subsequent sibling hooks, in addition to hooks in child suites ([**@&#8203;juergba**](https://togithub.com/juergba))

-   [#&#8203;4178](https://togithub.com/mochajs/mocha/issues/4178): Remove previously soft-deprecated APIs ([**@&#8203;wnghdcjfe**](https://togithub.com/wnghdcjfe)):

### Release Notes

<details>
<summary>google/gts</summary>

### [`v2.0.0`](https://togithub.com/google/gts/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;200-httpswwwgithubcomgooglegtscomparev112v200-2020-04-02)

[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/google/gts/compare/v1.1.2...v2.0.0)

##### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES ⚠

This is a major rewrite of the tool.  Based on community guidance, we've switched from using [tslint](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/) to [eslint](https://eslint.org/).  _Please read all of the steps below to upgrade_.

##### Configuring `eslint`

With the shift to `eslint`, `gts` now will format and lint JavaScript _as well_ as TypeScript. Upgrading will require a number of manual steps.  To format JavaScript and TypeScript, you can run:

    $ npx gts fix

To specify only TypeScript:

    $ npx gts fix '**/*.ts'

##### Delete `tslint.json`

This file is no longer used, and can lead to confusion.

##### Create a `.eslintrc.json`

Now that we're using eslint, you need to extend the eslint configuration baked into the module.  Create a new file named `.eslintrc.json`, and paste the following:

```js
{
  ""extends"": ""./node_modules/gts""
}
```

##### Create a `.eslintignore`

The `.eslintignore` file lets you ignore specific directories.  This tool now lints and formats JavaScript, so it's _really_ important to ignore your build directory!  Here is an example of a `.eslintignore` file:

    **/node_modules
    build/

##### Rule changes

The underlying linter was changed, so naturally there are going to be a variety of rule changes along the way.  To see the full list, check out [.eslintrc.json](https://togithub.com/google/gts/blob/master/.eslintrc.json).

##### Require Node.js 10.x and up

##### BREAKING CHANGES

-   Require Node.js >= 10.13
-   this feature change the way semantic-release keep track of the channels on which a version has been released.
    It now use a JSON object stored in a [Git note](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-notes) instead of Git tags formatted as v{version}@&#8203;{channel}.

The tags formatted as v{version}@&#8203;{channel} will now be ignored. If you have made releases with v16.0.0 on branches other than the default one you will have to update your repository.

The changes to make consist in:

-   Finding all the versions that have been released on a branch other than the default one by searching for all tags formatted v{version}@&#8203;{channel}
-   For each of those version:
    -   Create a tag without the {[@&#8203;channel](https://togithub.com/channel)} if none doesn't already exists
    -   Add a Git note to the tag without the {[@&#8203;channel](https://togithub.com/channel)} containing the channels on which the version was released formatted as `{""channels"":[""channel1"",""channel2""]}` and using `null` for the default channel (for example.`{""channels"":[null,""channel1"",""channel2""]}`)
    -   Push the tags and notes
    -   Update the GitHub releases that refer to a tag formatted as v{version}@&#8203;{channel} to use the tag without it
    -   Delete the tags formatted as v{version}@&#8203;{channel}

-   Git CLI version 2.7.1 or higher is now required

The `--merge` option of the `git tag` command has been added in Git version 2.7.1 and is now used by semantic-release

-   Require Node.js => 8.15
-   **package:** Regexp are not supported anymore for property matching in the `releaseRules` option.

Regex are replaced by [globs](https://togithub.com/micromatch/micromatch#matching-features). For example `/core-.*/` should be changed to `'core-*'`.

-   the `branch` option has been removed in favor of `branches`

The new `branches` option expect either an Array or a single branch definition. To migrate your configuration:

-   If you want to publish package from multiple branches, please the configuration documentation
-   If you use the default configuration and want to publish only from `master`: nothing to change
-   If you use the `branch` configuration and want to publish only from one branch: replace `branch` by `branches` (`""branch"": ""my-release-branch""` => `""branches"": ""my-release-branch""`)

![Screen Shot 2019-11-20 at 9 50 17 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2289/69309009-8fb7f900-0be0-11ea-95c0-0313be6be626.png)

That message is friendly enough, but it means I have to revise my commit history in order for my PR to pass all checks. I know how to revise my git commit history, but others may not.

I maintain a GitHub app called [Semantic Pull Requests](https://github.com/apps/semantic-pull-requests) that serves a similar purpose to commitlint, but takes a different approach:

> The default behavior of this bot is not to police all commit messages, but rather to ensure that every PR has just enough semantic information to be able to trigger a release when appropriate. The goal is to gather this semantic information in a way that doesn't make life harder for project contributors, especially newcomers who may not know how to amend their git commit history.

I noticed when my PR landed that this project is using `semantic-release`. That's awesome! The Semantic Pull Requests bot was designed with `semantic-release` in mind.

Advantages over commitlint:

- git history doesn't need to be revised
- a single semantic commit (or semantic pull request title if squashed) is adequate semantic info to trigger a semantic release
- no lingering PR comments about commit message infractions

In the current API doc:

> `linksToSkip` (array) - An array of regular expression strings that should be skipped during the scan.

This works, but it can be cumbersome to write exclusion rules just using regular expressions. It would be nifty if this option (or a new option) could be passed a function instead of an array. The function would take the given link URL as input and return a Boolean indicating whether to skip it or not:

```js
filterLinks: (url) => {
  return true // or false
}
```

I'd be willing to open a PR to add support for this.

So, if I do `linkinator build/  --recurse` it fails because it doesn't see an index.html. If I do `linkinator build/en  --recurse` then I get false positives because linkinator can't find the root.

Is there a workaround or something you could do about it?

* **Version** — 1.5.0

## Steps

1. Run linkinator against a URL which will produce some kind of request error — ex., a domain with an SSL certificate issue:

```
npx linkinator https://example.com.s3.amazonaws.com
```

(Alternatively, run linkinator against a page which links to a URL that will produce the error.)

## Current Behavior

This is currently reported with error status `0`, and no additional details:

```
$ npx linkinator https://example.com.s3.amazonaws.com
🏊‍♂️ crawling https://example.com.s3.amazonaws.com
  [0] https://example.com.s3.amazonaws.com


ERROR: Detected 1 broken links. Scanned 1 links in 0.294 seconds.
```

## Desired Behavior

It would be helpful, especially in cases where the request error uncovers a previously unknown issue at the URL in question, if any additional information about the request failure could be included in the summary.

(It could be outside the scope of the tool to report information beyond HTTP status code, which I would certainly understand.)

I recommend you give this issue a high priority, so other packages depending on you could benefit from your bug fixes and new features.

You can find below the list of errors reported by **semantic-release**. Each one of them has to be resolved in order to automatically publish your package. I’m sure you can resolve this 💪.

Errors are usually caused by a misconfiguration or an authentication problem. With each error reported below you will find explanation and guidance to help you to resolve it.

Once all the errors are resolved, **semantic-release** will release your package the next time you push a commit to the `master` branch. You can also manually restart the failed CI job that runs **semantic-release**.

If you are not sure how to resolve this, here is some links that can help you:
- [Usage documentation](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/blob/caribou/docs/usage/README.md)
- [Frequently Asked Questions](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/blob/caribou/docs/support/FAQ.md)
- [Support channels](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release#get-help)

If those don’t help, or if this issue is reporting something you think isn’t right, you can always ask the humans behind **[semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/issues/new)**.

### Invalid npm token.

The [npm token](https://github.com/semantic-release/npm/blob/master/README.md#npm-registry-authentication) configured in the `NPM_TOKEN` environment variable must be a valid [token](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/working_with_tokens) allowing to publish to the registry `https://registry.npmjs.org/`.

If you are using Two-Factor Authentication, make configure the `auth-only` [level](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/using-two-factor-authentication#levels-of-authentication) is supported. **semantic-release** cannot publish with the default `auth-and-writes` level.

Please make sure to set the `NPM_TOKEN` environment variable in your CI with the exact value of the npm token.

### Release Notes

<details>
<summary>google/gts</summary>

### [`v1.0.0`](https://togithub.com/google/gts/releases/v1.0.0)

[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/google/gts/compare/v0.9.0...v1.0.0)

**This release contains breaking changes. Picking up this update most likely will cause a breaking change in your module. Take care when picking up this update.**

### Breaking Changes

-   We have switched to [prettier](https://prettier.io) as the code formatting tool ([#&#8203;259](https://togithub.com/google/gts/issues/259)). `gts run fix` should migrate your code over to the new style 💅.
-   This release drops support for Node 6 which will reach end-of-life in April 2019 ([#&#8203;256](https://togithub.com/google/gts/issues/256)) 💀.
-   This release defaults to ES2017 as the TypeScript code generation target. This means that the generated code needs a minimum of Node 8 to run. On the plus side this means that generated code would use native implementation of ES2017 features (e.g. async/await) rather than using poly-fills 🧬. **This change is most likely a breaking change for your module**. You can override this setting by customizing your `tsconfig.json` however.
-   The `tslint` configuration has been updated to pick up changes in the Google style guide🧐.
-   Assumes that target projects are using TypeScript 3.x+ 🎯.

### Other features

-   Support for yarn ([#&#8203;285](https://togithub.com/google/gts/issues/285))

##### BREAKING CHANGES

-   The `--exclude-after-remap` option is now functional and enabled by default.  This causes the `include` and `exclude` lists to be processed after using source maps to determine the original filename of sources.
-   Add a file named 'index.json' to the .nyc_output/processinfo directory, which has a different format from the other files in this dir.
-   Change the data type of the pid/ppid fields in processinfo files
-   `nyc instrument` now honors `include` and `exclude` settings, potentially resulting in some files that were previously instrumented being ignored.
-   The `plugins` option has been renamed to `parser-plugins`.
-   The logic involving include/exclude processing has changed.  Results should be verified to ensure all desired sources have coverage data.
-   `nyc instrument` now enables the `--es-module` option by default.  This can cause failures to instrument scripts which violate `'use strict'` rules.

It's like when a link is discovered in crawl mode, it jumps to that page immediately and then comes back to the original file that referenced the link.

Wouldn't it make more sense to finish each page and then for each link that is discovered, follow it?

Just thinking out loud here, trying to see why I get so different results with and without recurse :)

I'm looking for a good replacement of https://www.npmjs.com/package/broken-link-checker to use in Bootstrap and came across your module.

It does look pretty simple and does quite a good job. I was wondering if you could add a few options, haven't checked if the lib already exposes them so if it's a matter of exposing them to the CLI.

1. An option to skip external links. In our case this speeds things up *a lot*
2. An option to control concurrency
3. Maybe print the total time spent and/or total links that were checked even when an error occurs?
4. It seems the tool follows redirects. Can you show it in the output too?


This is a question, what's the depth when `--recurse` is used?

Thanks in advance!

However it would appear we've stumbled onto an edge case where it finds links via JavaScript files with HTML stored as a string. This gets funky because link attributes end up getting double escaped `href=\""hi\""` -> `href=\\""hi\\""` at which point I believe the HTML parser assumes the quotes were simply omitted. 

I'm thinking we probably want to do one of the following

This patch features a fix to address a potential ""low severity"" [ReDoS vulnerability](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:diff:20180305) in the [diff](https://npm.im/diff) package (a dependency of Mocha).

#### :lock: Security Fixes

### [`v5.0.2`](https://togithub.com/mochajs/mocha/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;502--2018-03-05)

[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/mochajs/mocha/compare/v5.0.1...v5.0.2)

This release fixes a class of tests which report as _false positives_.  **Certain tests will now break**, though they would have previously been reported as passing.  Details below.  Sorry for the inconvenience!

#### :bug: Fixes

-   [#&#8203;3226](https://togithub.com/mochajs/mocha/issues/3226): Do not swallow errors that are thrown asynchronously from passing tests ([@&#8203;boneskull](https://togithub.com/boneskull)).  Example:

    \```js
    it('should actually fail, sorry!', function (done) {
      // passing assertion
      assert(true === true);

      // test complete & is marked as passing
      done();

      // ...but something evil lurks within
      setTimeout(() => {
        throw new Error('chaos!');
      }, 100);
    });
    \```

    Previously to this version, Mocha would have _silently swallowed_ the `chaos!` exception, and you wouldn't know.  Well, _now you know_.  Mocha cannot recover from this gracefully, so it will exit with a nonzero code.

    **Maintainers of external reporters**: _If_ a test of this class is encountered, the `Runner` instance will emit the `end` event _twice_; you _may_ need to change your reporter to use `runner.once('end')` intead of `runner.on('end')`.

[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/mochajs/mocha/compare/v4.1.0...v5.0.0)

Mocha starts off 2018 right by again dropping support for _unmaintained rubbish_.

Welcome [@&#8203;vkarpov15](https://togithub.com/vkarpov15) to the team!

#### :boom: Breaking Changes

-   **[#&#8203;3148](https://togithub.com/mochajs/mocha/issues/3148): Drop support for IE9 and IE10** ([@&#8203;Bamieh](https://togithub.com/Bamieh))
    Practically speaking, only code which consumes (through bundling or otherwise) the userland [buffer](https://npm.im/buffer) module should be affected.  However, Mocha will no longer test against these browsers, nor apply fixes for them.

#### :tada: Enhancements

### Release Notes

<summary>domenic/chai-as-promised</summary>

### [`v7.1.1`](https://togithub.com/domenic/chai-as-promised/releases/v7.1.1)

[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/domenic/chai-as-promised/compare/v7.1.0...v7.1.1)

Fixes ESLint accidentally being included as a dependency since v7.0.0.

### [`v7.1.0`](https://togithub.com/domenic/chai-as-promised/releases/v7.1.0)

[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/domenic/chai-as-promised/compare/v7.0.0...v7.1.0)

Fixes Chai's proxy protection for property assertions (when using Chai v4 or higher). ([@&#8203;meeber](https://togithub.com/meeber), [#&#8203;205](https://togithub.com/domenic/chai-as-promised/issues/205))

### [`v7.0.0`](https://togithub.com/domenic/chai-as-promised/releases/v7.0.0)

[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/domenic/chai-as-promised/compare/v6.0.0...v7.0.0)

The breaking change in this release is that it has started using syntax that is only supported on Node.js v4 and above, as previous versions of Node no longer are supported by the Node.js project itself. As such browser consumers will also need to take care to transpile when testing on older browsers.

Additionally, Chai as Promised now supports Chai v4 ([@&#8203;meeber](https://togithub.com/meeber)).

### [`v4.0.2`](https://togithub.com/chaijs/chai/releases/4.0.2)

[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/chaijs/chai/compare/4.0.1...4.0.2)

We have another bugfix release, addressing some issues for WebPack 1 users.

### Bug Fixes

-   Revert getting version information from package.json, some bundler tools like Webpack do not come default with json loaders despite Node being able to handle this. This change moves back to hardcoding the version number in the codebase. ([#&#8203;985](https://togithub.com/chaijs/chai/issues/985), [#&#8203;986](https://togithub.com/chaijs/chai/pull/986))

### [`v4.0.1`](https://togithub.com/chaijs/chai/releases/4.0.1)

[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/chaijs/chai/compare/4.0.0...4.0.1)

### 4.0.1

Of course, any major release cannot go without a quick bugfix release shortly after - and here's ours!

### Bug Fixes

-   Remove package.json `browser` field which was mistakenly added, and caused bundler tools like Browserify or Webpack to fail as it attempted to rebundle an already bundled file. ([#&#8203;978](https://togithub.com/chaijs/chai/issues/978), [#&#8203;982](https://togithub.com/chaijs/chai/pull/982))

### [`v4.0.0`](https://togithub.com/chaijs/chai/releases/4.0.0)

[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/chaijs/chai/compare/3.5.0...4.0.0)

### 4.0.0

4.0 has been a huge undertaking by the chai community! A lot has changed to ensure Chai 4 is a stable, reliable, well documented codebase. Here are just some of the major improvements:

-   almost all documentation has been rewritten, with detailed instructions on how assertions work, which flags they can be combined with and the best practices for how to use them.

-   deep equality has been rewritten from the ground up to support ES6 types like `Map` and `Set`, and better support existing types. It is now also much, much faster than before and allows us to bring some great improvements in upcoming releases.

-   we have made sure the `deep` flag now _only ever does deep equality_. Beforehand, it would sometimes also be used to test nested properties (for example `expect(foo).to.have.deep.property('bar.baz')`. For nested assertions, please now use the `.nested` flag.

-   many assertions have become more strict, which means you get better error messages explaining where things have gone wrong. For the most part, this wont mean error messages where there weren't error messages before, but it will mean better error messages to replace the, sometimes cryptic, default `TypeError` messages.

-   we've added detections and helpful error messages for common mistakes and typos. The error messages will, in some cases, point you to documentation or in other cases suggest alternatives. These messages will continue to be improved in future releases, so let us know if you have any suggestions!

### Breaking Changes

-   We no longer support Node v0.10 and v0.12 (since their LTS has ended) _(PRs: [#&#8203;816](https://togithub.com/chaijs/chai/issues/816), [#&#8203;901](https://togithub.com/chaijs/chai/issues/901))_
-   Instead of allowing the user to write the path of a property, **now the deep flag performs a deep equality comparison when used with the `.property` assertion**.
    If you want the old behavior of using the dot or bracket notation to denote the property you want to assert against **you can use the new `.nested` flag**. _(Related Issues: [#&#8203;745](https://togithub.com/chaijs/chai/issues/745), [#&#8203;743](https://togithub.com/chaijs/chai/issues/743), PRs: [#&#8203;758](https://togithub.com/chaijs/chai/issues/758), [#&#8203;757](https://togithub.com/chaijs/chai/issues/757))_

    ```js
    const obj = {a: 1};

    // The `.deep` flag now does deep equality comparisons
    expect({foo: obj}).to.have.deep.property('foo', {a: 1});

    // Use the `nested` flag if you want to assert against a nested property using the bracket or dot notation
    expect({foo: obj}).to.have.nested.property('foo.a', 1);

    // You can also use both flags combined
    const obj2 = {a: {b: 2}};
    expect({foo: obj2}).to.have.deep.nested.property('foo.a', {b: 2});
    ```

    Please notice that the old methods which used the old behavior of the `deep` flag on the `assert` interface have been renamed. They all have had the `deep` word changed by the `nested` word. If you want to know more about this please take a look at [#&#8203;757](https://togithub.com/chaijs/chai/issues/757).

-   Previously, `expect(obj).not.property(name, val)` would throw an Error if `obj` didn't have a property named `name`. This change causes the assertion to pass instead.
    The `assert.propertyNotVal` and `assert.deepPropertyNotVal` assertions were renamed to `assert.notPropertyVal` and `assert.notDeepPropertyVal`, respectively. _(Related Issues: [#&#8203;16](https://togithub.com/chaijs/chai/issues/16), [#&#8203;743](https://togithub.com/chaijs/chai/issues/743), [#&#8203;758](https://togithub.com/chaijs/chai/issues/758))_

-   You can now use the `deep` flag for the `.include` assertion in order to perform a `deep` equality check to see if something is included on the `target`.
    Previously, `.include` was using strict equality (`===`) for non-negated property inclusion, but `deep` equality for negated property inclusion and array inclusion.
    **This change causes the .include assertion to always use strict equality unless the deep flag is set.**
    Please take a look [at this comment](https://togithub.com/chaijs/chai/issues/743#issuecomment-235763477) if you want to know more about it.  _(Related Issues: [#&#8203;743](https://togithub.com/chaijs/chai/issues/743), PRs: [#&#8203;760](https://togithub.com/chaijs/chai/issues/760), [#&#8203;761](https://togithub.com/chaijs/chai/issues/761))_

    ```js
    const obj = {a: 1};
    expect([obj]).to.deep.include({a:1});
    expect({foo: obj}).to.deep.include({foo: {a:1}});
    ```

-   Fix unstable behavior of the `NaN` assertion. Now we use the suggested ES6 implementation.
    The new implementation is now more correct, strict and simple. While the old one threw false positives, the new implementation only checks if something is `NaN` (or not if the `.not` flag is used) and nothing else. _(Related Issues: [#&#8203;498](https://togithub.com/chaijs/chai/issues/498), [#&#8203;682](https://togithub.com/chaijs/chai/issues/682), [#&#8203;681](https://togithub.com/chaijs/chai/issues/681), PRs: [#&#8203;508](https://togithub.com/chaijs/chai/issues/508))_

    ```js
    // Only `NaN` will be considered to be `NaN` and nothing else
    expect(NaN).to.be.NaN;

    // Anything that is not `NaN` cannot be considered as `NaN`
    expect('randomString').not.to.be.NaN;
    expect(true).not.to.be.NaN;
    expect({}).not.to.be.NaN;
    expect(4).not.to.be.NaN;
    ```

-   The Typed Array types are now truncated if they're too long (in this case, if they exceed the `truncateThreshold` value on the `config`). _(Related Issues: [#&#8203;441](https://togithub.com/chaijs/chai/issues/441), PRs: [#&#8203;576](https://togithub.com/chaijs/chai/issues/576))_

    ```js
    var arr = [];
    for (var i = 1; i <= 1000; i++) {
      arr.push(i);
    }

    // The assertion below will truncate the diff shown and the enormous typed array will be shown as:
    // [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, ...  ] instead of printing the whole typed array
    chai.expect(new Float32Array(100)).to.equal(1);
    ```

-   The assertions: `within`, `above`, `least`, `below`, `most`, `increase`, `decrease` will throw an error if the assertion's target or arguments are not numbers. _(Related Issues: [#&#8203;691](https://togithub.com/chaijs/chai/issues/691), PRs: [#&#8203;692](https://togithub.com/chaijs/chai/issues/692), [#&#8203;796](https://togithub.com/chaijs/chai/issues/796))_

    ```js
    // These will throw errors, for example:
    expect(null).to.be.within(0, 1);
    expect(null).to.be.above(10);
    expect(null).to.be.at.least(20);
    expect(null).to.be.below(20);
    expect(null).to.be.at.most(20);
    expect(null).to.increase.by(20);
    expect(null).to.decrease.by(20);

    // This will not:
    expect('string').to.have.a.lengthOf.at.least(3);
    ```

-   Previously, `expect(obj).not.ownProperty(name, val)` would throw an Error if obj didn't have an own property (non-inherited) named name. This change causes the assertion to pass instead. (Related Issues: [#&#8203;795](https://togithub.com/chaijs/chai/issues/795), #, PRs: [#&#8203;744](https://togithub.com/chaijs/chai/issues/744), [#&#8203;810](https://togithub.com/chaijs/chai/issues/810))\*

    ```js
    expect({ foo: 'baz' }).to.not.have.own.property('quux', 'baz');
    ```

-   The `.empty` assertion will now throw when it is passed non-string primitives and functions _(PRs: [#&#8203;763](https://togithub.com/chaijs/chai/issues/763), [#&#8203;812](https://togithub.com/chaijs/chai/issues/812))_

    ```js
    // These will throw TypeErrors:
    expect(Symbol()).to.be.empty;
    expect(function() {}).to.be.empty;
    expect(true).to.be.empty;
    expect(1).to.be.empty
    ```

-   Assertion subject (`obj`) changes when using `ownProperty` or `own.property` and thus enables chaining. _(Related Issues: [#&#8203;281](https://togithub.com/chaijs/chai/issues/281), PRs: [#&#8203;641](https://togithub.com/chaijs/chai/issues/641))_

    ```js
    expect({val: 20}).to.have.own.property('val').above(10);
    ```

-   The `.change`, `.increase`, and `.decrease` assertions changed from chainable method assertions to method assertions. They don't have any chaining behavior, and there's no generic semantic benefit to chaining them. _(Related Issues: [#&#8203;917](https://togithub.com/chaijs/chai/issues/917), PRs: [#&#8203;925](https://togithub.com/chaijs/chai/issues/925))_

    // This will not work anymore because there is no benefit to chaining these assertions:
    expect(function() {}).to.change.by(2)
    expect(function() {}).to.increase.by(2)
    expect(function() {}).to.decrease.by(2)

-   The `utils` (second argument passed to the `chai.use` callback function) no longer exports the `getPathValue` function. If you want to use that please use the [`pathval`](https://togithub.com/chaijs/pathval) module, which is what chai uses internally now. _(Related Issues: [#&#8203;457](https://togithub.com/chaijs/chai/issues/457), [#&#8203;737](https://togithub.com/chaijs/chai/issues/737), PRs: [#&#8203;830](https://togithub.com/chaijs/chai/issues/830))_

-   (_For plugin authors_) Throw when calling `_super`on `overwriteMethod`if the method being overwritten is `undefined`.
    Currently if the method you are trying to overwrite is not defined and your new method calls `_super` it will throw an `Error`._(Related Issues: [#&#8203;467](https://togithub.com/chaijs/chai/issues/467), PRs: [#&#8203;528](https://togithub.com/chaijs/chai/issues/528))_
    Before this change, calling `_super` would simply return `this`.

    ```js
    // Considering the method `imaginaryMethod` does not exist, this would throw an error for example:
    chai.use(function (chai, utilities) {
      chai.Assertion.overwriteMethod('imaginaryMethod', function (_super) {
        return function () {
          _super.apply(this, arguments);
        }
      });
    });

    // This will throw an error since you are calling `_super` which should be a method (in this case, the overwritten assertion) that does not exist
    expect('anything').to.imaginaryMethod(); 
    ```

-   (_For plugin authors_) Now `showDiff` is turned on by default whenever the `showDiff` flag is anything other than `false`.
    This issue will mostly affect plugin creators or anyone that made extensions to the core, since this affects the `Assertion.assert` method. _(Related Issues: [#&#8203;574](https://togithub.com/chaijs/chai/issues/574), PRs: [#&#8203;515](https://togithub.com/chaijs/chai/issues/515))_

    ```js
    // Now whenever you call `Assertion.assert` with anything that is not false for the `showDiff` flag it will be true
    // The assertion error that was thrown will have the `showDiff` flag turned on since it was not passed to the `assert` method
    try {
      new chai.Assertion().assert(
          'one' === 'two'
        , 'expected #{this} to equal #{exp}'
        , 'expected #{this} to not equal #{act}'
        , 'one'
        , 'two'
      );
    } catch(e) {
      assert.isTrue(e.showDiff);
    }

    // The assertion error that was thrown will have the `showDiff` flag turned off since here we passed `false` explicitly
    try {
      new chai.Assertion().assert(
          'one' === 'two'
        , 'expected #{this} to equal #{exp}'
        , 'expected #{this} to not equal #{act}'
        , 'one'
        , 'two'
        , false
      );
    } catch(e) {
      assert.isFalse(e.showDiff);
    }
    ```

### New Features

-   Throw when non-existent property is read. _(Related Issues: [#&#8203;407](https://togithub.com/chaijs/chai/issues/407), [#&#8203;766](https://togithub.com/chaijs/chai/issues/766) PRs: [#&#8203;721](https://togithub.com/chaijs/chai/issues/721), [#&#8203;770](https://togithub.com/chaijs/chai/issues/770))_
    **This is a potentially breaking change. Your build will fail if you have typos in your property assertions**
    Before `4.x.x` when using property assertions they would not throw an error if you wrote it incorrectly.
    The example below, for example, would pass:

    ```js
    expect(true).to.be.ture; // Oops, typo, now Chai will throw an Error
    ```

    Since this implementation depends on ES6 `Proxies` it will only work on platforms that support it.

    **This property can be enabled (default) or disabled through the `config.useProxy` property**, for example:

    ```js
    chai.config.useProxy = false;  // disable use of Proxy
    ```

-   Add fix suggestions when accessing a nonexistent property in proxy mode. _(Related Issues: [#&#8203;771](https://togithub.com/chaijs/chai/issues/771), PRs: [#&#8203;782](https://togithub.com/chaijs/chai/issues/782))_
    When a nonexistent property is accessed in proxy mode, Chai will compute [the levenshtein distance](http://www.levenshtein.net) to all possible properties in order to suggest the best fix to the user.

    ```js
    expect(false).to.be.fals; // Error: Invalid Chai property: fals. Did you mean ""false""?
    expect('foo').to.be.undefind; // Error: Invalid Chai property: undefind. Did you mean ""undefined""?

    // If the Levenshtein distance between the word and any Chai property is greater than 4, no fix will be suggested
    expect('foo').to.be.fdsakfdsafsagsadgagsdfasf // error thrown, no fix suggested
    ```

-   When non-chainable methods (including overwritten non-chainable methods) are used incorrectly an error will be thrown with a helpful error message. _(PRs: [#&#8203;789](https://togithub.com/chaijs/chai/issues/789))_

    ```js
    expect(true).to.equal.true;  // Invalid Chai property: equal.true. See docs for proper usage of ""equal"".
    ```

-   Add a new configuration setting that describes which keys will be ignored when checking for non-existing properties on an assertion before throwing an error.
    Since this implementation depends on ES6 `Proxies` it will only work on platforms that support it. Also, if you disable `config.useProxy`, this setting will have no effect. _(Related Issues: [#&#8203;765](https://togithub.com/chaijs/chai/issues/765), PRs: [#&#8203;774](https://togithub.com/chaijs/chai/issues/774))_

    ```js
    chai.config.proxyExcludedKeys.push('nonExistingProp');

    expect('my string').to.nonExistingProp; // This won't throw an error now
    ```

-   Add script that registers should as a side-effect. _(Related Issues: [#&#8203;594](https://togithub.com/chaijs/chai/issues/594), [#&#8203;693](https://togithub.com/chaijs/chai/issues/693) PRs: [#&#8203;604](https://togithub.com/chaijs/chai/issues/604))_

    ```js
    // You can now write:
    import 'chai/should';

    // as opposed to:
    import {should} from 'chai';
    should();
    ```

    You can also register should via a `mocha` option: `mocha --require chai/should`.

-   The `change` assertion accepts a function as object. _(Related Issues: [#&#8203;544](https://togithub.com/chaijs/chai/issues/544), PRs: [#&#8203;607](https://togithub.com/chaijs/chai/issues/607))_

    ```js
    // Now you can also check if the return value of a function changes, for example
    assert.increases(
      someOperation,
      () => getSomething().length
    )
    ```

-   You can also assert for a delta using the `by` assertion alongside the `change`, `increase` and `decrease` assertions. _(Related Issues: [#&#8203;339](https://togithub.com/chaijs/chai/issues/339), PRs: [#&#8203;621](https://togithub.com/chaijs/chai/issues/621))_

    ```js
    // You can use `.by` to assert the amount you want something to change
    var obj = { val: 10 };
    var increaseByTwo = function() { obj.val += 2 };
    var decreaseByTwo = function() { obj.val -= 2 };
    var increaseByThree = function() { obj.val += 3 };

    expect(increaseByThree).to.change(obj, 'val').by(3);
    expect(increaseByTwo).to.increase(obj, 'val').by(2);
    expect(decreaseByTwo).to.decrease(obj, 'val').by(2);

    // Please notice that if you want to assert something did change but not by some amount you need to use `.not` **after** the `change` related assertion
    // Take a look at the examples below:
    expect(increaseByThree).to.change(obj, 'val').but.not.by(5)
    expect(increaseByTwo).to.increase(obj, 'val').but.not.by(1)
    expect(decreaseByTwo).to.decrease(obj, 'val').but.not.by(1)
    ```

-   The `.keys` assertion can now operate on `map`s and `set`s. _(Related Issues: [#&#8203;632](https://togithub.com/chaijs/chai/issues/632), PRs: [#&#8203;633](https://togithub.com/chaijs/chai/issues/633), [#&#8203;668](https://togithub.com/chaijs/chai/issues/668))_

    ```js
    // The `.keys` assertion now works on `map`s and `set`s natively, like the examples below:
    expect(new Map([[{objKey: 'value'}, 'value'], [1, 2]])).to.contain.key({objKey: 'value'});
    expect(new Map([[{objKey: 'value'}, 'value'], [1, 2]])).to.contain.any.keys([{objKey: 'value'}, {anotherKey: 'anotherValue'}]);
    expect(new Map([['firstKey', 'firstValue'], [1, 2]])).to.contain.all.keys('firstKey', 1);
    expect(new Set([['foo', 'bar'], ['example', 1]])).to.have.any.keys('foo');

    // You can also use `.deep` when asserting agains `Map`s and `Set`s
    expect(new Map([[{objKey: 'value'}, 'value'], [1, 2]])).to.contain.any.deep.keys([{objKey: 'value'}, {anotherKey: 'anotherValue'}]);
    expect(new Map([['firstKey', 'firstValue'], [1, 2]])).to.contain.all.deep.keys('firstKey', 1);
    expect(new Set([['foo', 'bar'], ['example', 1]])).to.have.any.deep.keys('foo');
    ```

-   Add compatibility with strict mode. _(Related Issues: [#&#8203;578](https://togithub.com/chaijs/chai/issues/578), PRs: [#&#8203;665](https://togithub.com/chaijs/chai/issues/665))_

    ```js
    // This means you can now run your code with the `--use_strict` flag on Node
    // If want to understand more about this please read the issue related to this change
    ```

-   Add `does` and `but` as new no-op assertion. _(Related Issues: [#&#8203;700](https://togithub.com/chaijs/chai/issues/700), [#&#8203;339](https://togithub.com/chaijs/chai/issues/339) PRs: [#&#8203;621](https://togithub.com/chaijs/chai/issues/621), [#&#8203;701](https://togithub.com/chaijs/chai/issues/701))_

    ```js
    // You can now write assertions forming phrases with these two new words:
    expect(increaseByThree).to.change(obj, 'val').but.not.by(5);
    expect(foobar).to.have.property(""baz"").which.does.not.have.property(""thing"");
    ```

-   Allow `use` to be imported using new ES6 module syntax. _(Related Issues: [#&#8203;718](https://togithub.com/chaijs/chai/issues/718), PRs: [#&#8203;724](https://togithub.com/chaijs/chai/issues/724))_

    ```js
    // You can now import `use` using the ES6 module syntax, like the example below:
    import sinonChai from ""sinon-chai"";
    import {expect, use} from ""chai"";

    use(sinonChai);
    ```

    You can also use `require` alongside the new ES6 destructuring feature:

    ```js
    const sinonChai = require('sinon-chai');
    const {expect, use} = require(""chai"");

    use(sinonChai);
    ```

-   Add ordered flag for members assertion. _(Related Issues: [#&#8203;717](https://togithub.com/chaijs/chai/issues/717), PRs: [#&#8203;728](https://togithub.com/chaijs/chai/issues/728))_

    ```js
    // You can now use the `ordered` flag to assert the order of elements when using the `members` assertion:
    expect([1, 2, 3]).to.include.ordered.members([1, 2]); // This passes
    expect([1, 2, 3]).to.include.ordered.members([2, 3]); // This will fail! Read the docs to know more.
    ```

-   Add `.own` flag to `.property` assertion. It does the same thing as `.ownProperty` and cannot be used alongisde the new `.nested` flag. _(Related Issues: [#&#8203;795](https://togithub.com/chaijs/chai/issues/795), PRs: [#&#8203;810](https://togithub.com/chaijs/chai/issues/810))_

    ```js
    expect({a: 1}).to.have.own.property('a');

    // The example below will thrown an Error
    expect({a: {b: 1}}).to.have.own.nested.property('a.b', 1);
    ```

-   Add `.deep` support to `.property` assertion. _(Related Issues: [#&#8203;795](https://togithub.com/chaijs/chai/issues/795), PRs: [#&#8203;810](https://togithub.com/chaijs/chai/issues/810))_

    ```js
    expect({ foo: { bar: 'baz' } }).to.have.deep.own.property('foo', { bar: 'baz' });
    expect({ foo: { bar: { baz: 'quux' } } }).to.have.deep.nested.property('foo.bar', { baz: 'quux' });
    ```

-   The `.empty` assertion will now work with ES6 collections _(PRs: [#&#8203;763](https://togithub.com/chaijs/chai/issues/763), [#&#8203;812](https://togithub.com/chaijs/chai/issues/812), [#&#8203;814](https://togithub.com/chaijs/chai/issues/814))_
    Please notice that this assertion will throw an error when it is passed a `WeakMap` or `WeakSet`.

    ```js
    expect(new Set()).to.be.empty;
    expect(new Map()).to.be.empty;

    // The examples below will throw a TypeError:
    expect(new WeakSet()).to.be.empty;
    expect(new WeakMap()).to.be.empty;
    ```

-   Add script that registers `should` as a side-effect. This change allows you to register `should` via a mocha option by using: `mocha spec.js -r chai/register-should` and also allows you to register the testing style globally. _(Issues: [#&#8203;693](https://togithub.com/chaijs/chai/issues/693), PRs: [#&#8203;868](https://togithub.com/chaijs/chai/issues/868))_

    ```js
    require('chai/register-should');  // Using Should style
    ```

-   Add script that registers `assert` as a side-effect. This change allows you to register `assert` via a mocha option by using: `mocha spec.js -r chai/register-assert` _(Issues: [#&#8203;693](https://togithub.com/chaijs/chai/issues/693), PRs: [#&#8203;868](https://togithub.com/chaijs/chai/issues/868), [#&#8203;872](https://togithub.com/chaijs/chai/issues/872))_

    ```js
    require('chai/register-assert');  // Using Assert style
    ```

-   Add script that registers `expect` as a side-effect. This change allows you to register `expect` via a mocha option by using: `mocha spec.js -r chai/register-expect` _(Issues: [#&#8203;693](https://togithub.com/chaijs/chai/issues/693), PRs: [#&#8203;868](https://togithub.com/chaijs/chai/issues/868), [#&#8203;872](https://togithub.com/chaijs/chai/issues/872))_

    ```js
    require('chai/register-expect');  // Using Expect style
    ```

-   When the `length` assertion is chained directly off of an uninvoked method, it references `function`'s built-in `length` property instead of Chai's `length` assertion. This commit adds a guard to Chai methods to detect this problem and throw a helpful error message that advises the user on how to correct it. _(Issues: [#&#8203;684](https://togithub.com/chaijs/chai/issues/684), [#&#8203;841](https://togithub.com/chaijs/chai/issues/841), PRs: [#&#8203;897](https://togithub.com/chaijs/chai/issues/897))_

-   Allows the `lockSsfi` flag to be set when creating new Assertion. This flag controls whether or not the given `ssfi` flag should retain its current value, even as assertions are chained off of this object. This is usually set to `true` when creating a new assertion from within another assertion. It's also temporarily set to `true` before an overwritten assertion gets called by the overwriting assertion. _(Issues: [#&#8203;878](https://togithub.com/chaijs/chai/issues/878), [#&#8203;904](https://togithub.com/chaijs/chai/issues/904), PRs: [#&#8203;922](https://togithub.com/chaijs/chai/issues/922))_

    ```js
    // This will lock the stack stack function from this line on
    // The SSFI is the reference to the starting point for removing irrelevant frames from the stack trace
    new Assertion(obj, msg, ssfi, true).to.have.property('length')
    ```

-   The `nestedInclude`, `deepNestedInclude`, `ownInclude` and `deepOwnInclude` assertions and there negated pairs were added to the `assert` interface. _(Issues: [#&#8203;905](https://togithub.com/chaijs/chai/issues/905), PRs: [#&#8203;964](https://togithub.com/chaijs/chai/issues/964))_

    ```js
    // '[]' and '.' in property names can be escaped using double backslashes.

    assert.nestedInclude({'.a': {'b': 'x'}}, {'\\.a.[b]': 'x'});
    assert.notNestedInclude({'.a': {'b': 'x'}}, {'\\.a.b': 'y'});

    assert.deepNestedInclude({a: {b: [{x: 1}]}}, {'a.b[0]': {x: 1}});
    assert.notDeepNestedInclude({a: {b: [{x: 1}]}}, {'a.b[0]': {y: 1}});

    assert.ownInclude({ a: 1 }, { a: 1 });
    assert.notOwnInclude({ a: 1 }, { b: 2 });

    assert.deepOwnInclude({a: {b: 2}}, {a: {b: 2}});
    assert.notDeepOwnInclude({a: {b: 2}}, {a: {c: 3}});
    ```

It also does not consider the `retryDelay`, which according to the readme:
> Milliseconds to delay at first.  Defaults to 100.

Additionally, the formula for computing the exponential backoff should be something like:
```ts
Math.min((Math.pow(2, config.currentRetryAttempt) + Math.random()), MAX_DELAY) * 1000

### Release Notes

<details>
<summary>nock/nock</summary>

### [`v13.0.0`](https://togithub.com/nock/nock/releases/v13.0.0)

[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/nock/nock/compare/v12.0.3...v13.0.0)

[Migration Guide](https://togithub.com/nock/nock/blob/75507727cf09a0b7bf0aa7ebdf3621952921b82e/migration_guides/migrating_to_13.md)

##### Breaking changes

1.  `Scope.log` has been removed. Use the `debug` library when [debugging](https://togithub.com/nock/nock#debugging) failed matches.

2.  `socketDelay` has been removed. Use [`delayConnection`](https://togithub.com/nock/nock#delay-the-connection) instead.

3.  `delay`, `delayConnection`, and `delayBody` are now setters instead of additive.

4.  [When recording](https://togithub.com/nock/nock#recording), skipping body matching using `*` is no longer supported by `nock.define`.
    Set the definition body to `undefined` instead.

5.  `ClientRequest.abort()` has been updated to align with Node's native behavior.
    This could be considered a feature, however, it created some subtle differences that are not backwards compatible. Refer to the migration guide for details.  

6.  Playback of a mocked responses will now never happen until the 'socket' event is emitted.

In this major release, Mocha adds the ability to _run tests in parallel_. Better late than never! Please note the **breaking changes** detailed below.

Let's welcome [**@&#8203;giltayar**](https://togithub.com/giltayar) and [**@&#8203;nicojs**](https://togithub.com/nicojs) to the maintenance team!

#### :boom: Breaking Changes

-   [#&#8203;4164](https://togithub.com/mochajs/mocha/issues/4164): **Mocha v8.0.0 now requires Node.js v10.0.0 or newer.** Mocha no longer supports the Node.js v8.x line (""Carbon""), which entered End-of-Life at the end of 2019 ([**@&#8203;UlisesGascon**](https://togithub.com/UlisesGascon))

-   [#&#8203;4175](https://togithub.com/mochajs/mocha/issues/4175): Having been deprecated with a warning since v7.0.0, **`mocha.opts` is no longer supported** ([**@&#8203;juergba**](https://togithub.com/juergba))

    :sparkles: **WORKAROUND:** Replace `mocha.opts` with a [configuration file](https://mochajs.org/#configuring-mocha-nodejs).

-   [#&#8203;4260](https://togithub.com/mochajs/mocha/issues/4260): Remove `enableTimeout()` (`this.enableTimeout()`) from the context object ([**@&#8203;craigtaub**](https://togithub.com/craigtaub))

    :sparkles: **WORKAROUND:** Replace usage of `this.enableTimeout(false)` in your tests with `this.timeout(0)`.

-   [#&#8203;4315](https://togithub.com/mochajs/mocha/issues/4315): The `spec` option no longer supports a comma-delimited list of files ([**@&#8203;juergba**](https://togithub.com/juergba))

    :sparkles: **WORKAROUND**: Use an array instead (e.g., `""spec"": ""foo.js,bar.js""` becomes `""spec"": [""foo.js"", ""bar.js""]`).

-   [#&#8203;4309](https://togithub.com/mochajs/mocha/issues/4309): Drop support for Node.js v13.x line, which is now End-of-Life ([**@&#8203;juergba**](https://togithub.com/juergba))

-   [#&#8203;4282](https://togithub.com/mochajs/mocha/issues/4282): `--forbid-only` will throw an error even if exclusive tests are avoided via `--grep` or other means ([**@&#8203;arvidOtt**](https://togithub.com/arvidOtt))

-   [#&#8203;4223](https://togithub.com/mochajs/mocha/issues/4223): The context object's `skip()` (`this.skip()`) in a ""before all"" (`before()`) hook will no longer execute subsequent sibling hooks, in addition to hooks in child suites ([**@&#8203;juergba**](https://togithub.com/juergba))

-   [#&#8203;4178](https://togithub.com/mochajs/mocha/issues/4178): Remove previously soft-deprecated APIs ([**@&#8203;wnghdcjfe**](https://togithub.com/wnghdcjfe)):
    -   `Mocha.prototype.ignoreLeaks()`
    -   `Mocha.prototype.useColors()`
    -   `Mocha.prototype.useInlineDiffs()`
    -   `Mocha.prototype.hideDiff()`

#### :tada: Enhancements

-   [#&#8203;4245](https://togithub.com/mochajs/mocha/issues/4245): Add ability to run tests in parallel for Node.js (see [docs](https://mochajs.org/#parallel-tests)) ([**@&#8203;boneskull**](https://togithub.com/boneskull))

    :exclamation: See also [#&#8203;4244](https://togithub.com/mochajs/mocha/issues/4244); [Root Hook Plugins (docs)](https://mochajs.org/#root-hook-plugins) -- _root hooks must be defined via Root Hook Plugins to work in parallel mode_

-   [#&#8203;4304](https://togithub.com/mochajs/mocha/issues/4304): `--require` now works with ES modules ([**@&#8203;JacobLey**](https://togithub.com/JacobLey))

-   [#&#8203;4299](https://togithub.com/mochajs/mocha/issues/4299): In some circumstances, Mocha can run ES modules under Node.js v10 -- _use at your own risk!_ ([**@&#8203;giltayar**](https://togithub.com/giltayar))

#### :book: Documentation

-   [#&#8203;4246](https://togithub.com/mochajs/mocha/issues/4246): Add documentation for parallel mode and Root Hook plugins ([**@&#8203;boneskull**](https://togithub.com/boneskull))

#### :bug: Fixes

(All bug fixes in Mocha v8.0.0 are also breaking changes, and are listed above)

**EXPECTED:**

I expect to import an **ES Module** and bundle it with Webpack/Rollup/Parcel without the need to transpile `retry-axios` itself by Babel.

I'm talking about the provided `main` and missing `module` field as definied by the spec below:
https://github.com/JustinBeckwith/retry-axios/blob/fc8117e838c4e6764969e844707354bb8f85816d/package.json#L5

> `pkg.module` will point to a module that has ES2015 module syntax but **otherwise only syntax features that the target environments support**.
https://github.com/rollup/rollup/wiki/pkg.module

> Wait, it just means import and export – not other future JavaScript features?
> **Yes. ...**
https://github.com/rollup/rollup/wiki/pkg.module#wait-it-just-means-import-and-export--not-other-future-javascript-features

Babel allows you to disable just module syntax transpilation:
https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-env#modules

And Rollup, Webpack etc can be configured to target a specific module syntax.

| Package | Type | Update | Change |
|---|---|---|---|
| [gts](https://togithub.com/google/gts) | devDependencies | major | [`^1.0.0` -> `^2.0.0`](https://renovatebot.com/diffs/npm/gts/1.1.2/2.0.0) |

### Release Notes

<details>
<summary>google/gts</summary>

### [`v2.0.0`](https://togithub.com/google/gts/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;200-httpswwwgithubcomgooglegtscomparev112v200-2020-04-02)

[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/google/gts/compare/v1.1.2...v2.0.0)

##### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES ⚠

This is a major rewrite of the tool.  Based on community guidance, we've switched from using [tslint](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/) to [eslint](https://eslint.org/).  _Please read all of the steps below to upgrade_.

##### Configuring `eslint`

With the shift to `eslint`, `gts` now will format and lint JavaScript _as well_ as TypeScript. Upgrading will require a number of manual steps.  To format JavaScript and TypeScript, you can run:

    $ npx gts fix

To specify only TypeScript:

    $ npx gts fix '**/*.ts'

##### Delete `tslint.json`

This file is no longer used, and can lead to confusion.

##### Create a `.eslintrc.json`

Now that we're using eslint, you need to extend the eslint configuration baked into the module.  Create a new file named `.eslintrc.json`, and paste the following:

```js
{
  ""extends"": ""./node_modules/gts""
}
```

##### Create a `.eslintignore`

The `.eslintignore` file lets you ignore specific directories.  This tool now lints and formats JavaScript, so it's _really_ important to ignore your build directory!  Here is an example of a `.eslintignore` file:

    **/node_modules
    build/

##### Rule changes

The underlying linter was changed, so naturally there are going to be a variety of rule changes along the way.  To see the full list, check out [.eslintrc.json](https://togithub.com/google/gts/blob/master/.eslintrc.json).

##### Require Node.js 10.x and up

Node.js 8.x is now end of life - this module now requires Ndoe.js 10.x and up.

Context for future me. The issue here boils down to the way axios merges their default configuration along with request level configuration.  The merging code goes through a named set of parameters, and only merges known properties.  `raxConfig` is pinned on the config, so it is not in said named list.  The offending code is here:
https://github.com/axios/axios/blob/master/lib/core/mergeConfig.js#L19

```js
var valueFromConfig2Keys = ['url', 'method', 'params', 'data'];
  var mergeDeepPropertiesKeys = ['headers', 'auth', 'proxy'];
  var defaultToConfig2Keys = [
    'baseURL', 'url', 'transformRequest', 'transformResponse', 'paramsSerializer',
    'timeout', 'withCredentials', 'adapter', 'responseType', 'xsrfCookieName',
    'xsrfHeaderName', 'onUploadProgress', 'onDownloadProgress',
    'maxContentLength', 'validateStatus', 'maxRedirects', 'httpAgent',
    'httpsAgent', 'cancelToken', 'socketPath'
  ];
```

### Release Notes

<details>
<summary>semantic-release/semantic-release</summary>

### [`v16.0.1`](https://togithub.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/releases/v16.0.1)

[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/compare/v16.0.0...v16.0.1)

##### Bug Fixes

-   **package:** update env-ci to version 5.0.0 ([3739ab5](https://togithub.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/commit/3739ab5f34454321aad2bf36f3a5ec03da004d33))

### [`v16.0.0`](https://togithub.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/releases/v16.0.0)

[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/compare/v15.14.0...v16.0.0)

##### BREAKING CHANGES

-   ⚠️ For `v16.0.0@&#8203;beta` users only:

    In v16, a JSON object stored in a [Git note](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-notes) is used to keep track of the channels on which a version has been released, the `@{channel}` suffix is no longer necessary. 

    The tags formatted as v{version}@&#8203;{channel} will now be ignored. If you have releases using this format you will have to upgrade them:

    -   Find all the versions that have been released on a branch other than the default one by searching for all tags formatted as `v{version}@&#8203;{channel}`
    -   For each of those version:
        -   Create a tag without the {[@&#8203;channel](https://togithub.com/channel)} if none doesn't already exists
        -   Add a Git note to the tag without the {[@&#8203;channel](https://togithub.com/channel)} containing the channels on which the version was released formatted as `{""channels"":[""channel1"",""channel2""]}` and using `null` for the default channel (for example.`{""channels"":[null,""channel1"",""channel2""]}`)
        -   Push the tags and notes
        -   Update the GitHub releases that refer to a tag formatted as v{version}@&#8203;{channel} to use the tag without it
        -   Delete the tags formatted as v{version}@&#8203;{channel}

-   Require Node.js >= 10.13
-   Git CLI version 2.7.1 or higher is now required: The `--merge` option of the `git tag` command has been added in Git version 2.7.1 and is now used by semantic-release
-   Regexp are not supported anymore for property matching in the `releaseRules` option.

    Regex are replaced by [globs](https://togithub.com/micromatch/micromatch#matching-features). For example `/core-.*/` should be changed to `'core-*'`.

-   The `branch` option has been removed in favor of `branches`

-   The new `branches` option expect either an Array or a single branch definition. To migrate your configuration:
    -   If you want to publish package from multiple branches, please see the configuration documentation
    -   If you use the default configuration and want to publish only from `master`: nothing to change
    -   If you use the `branch` configuration and want to publish only from one branch: replace `branch` with `branches` (`""branch"": ""my-release-branch""` => `""branches"": ""my-release-branch""`)

##### Features

#### Upgrading from Nock 10 to Nock 11

##### Bug fixes and internal improvements

Nock 11 includes many under-the-hood improvements, including a fully offline
test suite and 100% test coverage. The codebase was also converted to ES6
syntax and formatted with Prettier. Leaning on the test coverage, some
substantial refactors have begun.

Many bug fixes are included. See the detailed changelog below or the
[compare view][compare] for details.

##### Fabulous new features for developers

1.  The library ships with TypeScript definitions. (Added in v11.3)
2.  Add support for the `http.request` signatures added in Node 10.9
3.  Scopes can be filtered using the system environment or any external factor
    using e.g. `.conditionally(() => true)`
4.  In-flight modifications to headers are preserved in mock requests.
5.  Recorded mocks can be stringified using custom code in the `afterRecord()`
    post-processing hook. When `afterRecord()` returns a string, the
    recorder will no longer attempt to re-stringify it. (Added in v11.3)
6.  Reply functions passed to `.reply()` can now be async/promise-returning.
7.  Specifying reply headers, either via `.reply()` or `.defaultReplyHeaders()`,
    can now be done consistently using an object, Map, or flat array.

##### Breaking changes

For many developers no code changes will be needed. However, there are several
minor changes to the API, and it's possible that you will need to update your
code for Nock to keep working properly. It's unlikely that your tests will
falsely pass; what's more probable is that your tests will fail until the
necessary changes are made.

1.  Nock 11 requires Node 8 or later. Nock supports and tests all the ""current""
    and ""maintenance"" versions of Node. As of now, that's Node 8, 10, and 12.

2.  In Nock 10, when `reply()` was invoked with a function, the return values were
    handled ambiguously depending on their types.

    Consider the following example:

    ```js
    const scope = nock('http://example.com')
      .get('/')
      .reply(200, () => [500, 'hello world'])
    ```

    In Nock 10, the 200 was ignored, the 500 was interpreted as the status
    code, and the body would contain `'hello world'`. This caused problems
    when the goal was to return a numeric array, so in Nock 11, the 200 is
    properly interpreted as the status code, and `[500, 'hello world']` as the
    body.

    These are the correct calls for Nock 11:

    ```js
    const scope = nock('http://example.com')
      .get('/')
      .reply(500, 'hello world')

    const scope = nock('http://example.com')
      .get('/')
      .reply(500, () => 'hello world')
    ```

    The `.reply()` method can be called with explicit arguments:

    ```js
    .reply() // `statusCode` defaults to `200`.
    .reply(statusCode) // `responseBody` defaults to `''`.
    .reply(statusCode, responseBody) // `headers` defaults to `{}`.
    .reply(statusCode, responseBody, headers)
    ```

    It can be called with a status code and a function that returns an array:

    ```js
    .reply(statusCode, (path, requestBody) => responseBody)
    .reply(statusCode, (path, requestBody) => responseBody, headers)
    ```

    Alternatively the status code can be included in the array:

    ```js
    .reply((path, requestBody) => [statusCode])
    .reply((path, requestBody) => [statusCode, responseBody])
    .reply((path, requestBody) => [statusCode, responseBody, headers])
    .reply((path, requestBody) => [statusCode, responseBody], headers)
    ```

    `.reply()` can also be called with an `async` or promise-returning function. The
    signatures are identical, e.g.

    ```js
    .reply(async (path, requestBody) => [statusCode, responseBody])
    .reply(statusCode, async (path, requestBody) => responseBody)
    ```

    Finally, an error-first callback can be used, e.g.:

    ```js
    .reply((path, requestBody, cb) => cb(undefined, [statusCode, responseBody]))
    .reply(statusCode, (path, requestBody, cb) => cb(undefined, responseBody))
    ```

3.  In Nock 10, errors in user-provided reply functions were caught by Nock, and
    generated HTTP responses with status codes of 500. In Nock 11 these errors
    are not caught, and instead are re-emitted through the request, like any
    other error that occurs during request processing.

    Consider the following example:

    ```js
    const scope = nock('http://example.com')
      .post('/echo')
      .reply(201, (uri, requestBody, cb) => {
        fs.readFile('cat-poems.txt', cb) // Error-first callback
      })
    ```

    When `fs.readFile()` errors in Nock 10, a 500 error was emitted. To get the
    same effect in Nock 11, the example would need to be rewritten to:

    ```js
    const scope = nock('http://example.com')
      .post('/echo')
      .reply((uri, requestBody, cb) => {
        fs.readFile('cat-poems.txt', (err, contents) => {
          if (err) {
            cb([500, err.stack])
          } else {
            cb([201, contents])
          }
        })
      })
    ```

4.  When `.reply()` is invoked with something other than a whole number status
    code or a function, Nock 11 raises a new error **Invalid ... value for status code**.

5.  Callback functions provided to the `.query` method now receive the result of [`querystring.parse`](https://nodejs.org/api/querystring.html#querystring_querystring_parse_str_sep_eq_options) instead of [`qs.parse`](https://togithub.com/ljharb/qs#parsing-objects).

    In particular, `querystring.parse` does not interpret keys with JSON
    path notation:

    ```js
    querystring.parse('foo[bar]=baz') // { ""foo[bar]"": 'baz' }
    qs.parse('foo[bar]=baz') // { foo: { bar: 'baz' } }
    ```

6.  In Nock 10, duplicate field names provided to the `.query()` method were
    silently ignored. We decided this was probably hiding unintentionally bugs
    and causing frustration with users. In Nock 11, attempts to provide query
    params more than once will throw a new error
    **Query parameters have aleady been defined**. This could happen by calling
    `.query()` twice, or by calling `.query()` after specifying a literal query
    string via the path.

    ```js
    nock('http://example.com')
      .get('/path')
      .query({ foo: 'bar' })
      .query({ baz: 'qux' }) // <-- will throw
      .reply()

    nock('http://example.com')
      .get('/path?foo=bar')
      .query({ baz: 'qux' }) // <-- will throw
      .reply()
    ```

7.  Paths in Nock have always required a leading slash. e.g.

    ```js
    const scope = nock('http://example.com')
      .get('/path')
      .reply()
    ```

    In Nock 10, if the leading slash was missing the mock would never match. In
    Nock 11, this raises an error.

8.  The `reqheaders` parameter should be provided as a plain object, e.g.
    `nock('http://example.com', { reqheaders: { X-Foo: 'bar' }})`. When the
    headers are specified incorrectly as e.g. `{ reqheaders: 1 }`, Nock 10 would
    behave in unpredictable ways. In Nock 11, a new error
    **Headers must be provided as an object** is thrown.

    ```js
    nock('http://example.com', { reqheaders: 1 })
      .get('/')
      .reply()
    ```

9.  In Nock 10, the `ClientRequest` instance wrapped the native `on` method
    and aliased `once` to it. In Nock 11, this been removed and `request.once`
    will correctly call registered listeners...once.

10. In Nock 10, when the method was not specified in a call to `nock.define()`,
    the method would default to `GET`. In Nock 11, this raises an error.

11. In very old versions of nock, recordings may include a response status
    code encoded as a string in the `reply` field. In Nock 10 these strings could
    be non-numeric. In Nock 11 this raises an error.

##### Updates to the mock surface

1.  For parity with a real response, a mock request correctly supports all
    the overrides to `request.end()`, including `request.end(cb)` in Node 12.
2.  For parity with a real response, errors from the `.destroy()` method
    are propagated correctly. (Added in v11.3)
3.  For parity with a real response, the `.complete` property is set when
    ending the response.
4.  For parity with a real Socket, the mock Socket has an `unref()` function
    (which does nothing).

#### Detailed changelog

<details>
##### BREAKING CHANGES

-   uncaught errors thrown inside of user provided reply functions, whether async or not, will no longer be caught, and will no longer generate a successful response with a status code of 500. Instead, the error will be emitted by the request just like any other unhandled error during the request processing.
-   The only argument passed to the Interceptor.query callback now receives the output from querystring.parse instead of qs.parse. This means that instead of nested objects the argument will be a flat object.
-   **interceptor:** Attempting to call `Interceptor.query` twice throws an error.
-   **interceptor:** Providing a duplicate search parameter to the `query`
    method throws an error instead of ignoring subsequent values.
-   Drop support for Node 6

I recommend you give this issue a high priority, so other packages depending on you could benefit from your bug fixes and new features.

You can find below the list of errors reported by **semantic-release**. Each one of them has to be resolved in order to automatically publish your package. I’m sure you can resolve this 💪.

Errors are usually caused by a misconfiguration or an authentication problem. With each error reported below you will find explanation and guidance to help you to resolve it.

Once all the errors are resolved, **semantic-release** will release your package the next time you push a commit to the `master` branch. You can also manually restart the failed CI job that runs **semantic-release**.

If you are not sure how to resolve this, here is some links that can help you:
- [Usage documentation](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/blob/caribou/docs/usage/README.md)
- [Frequently Asked Questions](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/blob/caribou/docs/support/FAQ.md)
- [Support channels](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release#get-help)

If those don’t help, or if this issue is reporting something you think isn’t right, you can always ask the humans behind **[semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/issues/new)**.

### Invalid npm token.

The [npm token](https://github.com/semantic-release/npm/blob/master/README.md#npm-registry-authentication) configured in the `NPM_TOKEN` environment variable must be a valid [token](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/working_with_tokens) allowing to publish to the registry `https://registry.npmjs.org/`.

If you are using Two-Factor Authentication, make configure the `auth-only` [level](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/using-two-factor-authentication#levels-of-authentication) is supported. **semantic-release** cannot publish with the default `auth-and-writes` level.

Please make sure to set the `NPM_TOKEN` environment variable in your CI with the exact value of the npm token.

-   We have switched to [prettier](https://prettier.io) as the code formatting tool ([#&#8203;259](https://togithub.com/google/gts/issues/259)). `gts run fix` should migrate your code over to the new style 💅.
-   This release drops support for Node 6 which will reach end-of-life in April 2019 ([#&#8203;256](https://togithub.com/google/gts/issues/256)) 💀.
-   This release defaults to ES2017 as the TypeScript code generation target. This means that the generated code needs a minimum of Node 8 to run. On the plus side this means that generated code would use native implementation of ES2017 features (e.g. async/await) rather than using poly-fills 🧬. **This change is most likely a breaking change for your module**. You can override this setting by customizing your `tsconfig.json` however.
-   The `tslint` configuration has been updated to pick up changes in the Google style guide🧐.
-   Assumes that target projects are using TypeScript 3.x+ 🎯.

### Other features

-   Support for yarn ([#&#8203;285](https://togithub.com/google/gts/issues/285))

##### BREAKING CHANGES

-   The `--exclude-after-remap` option is now functional and enabled by default.  This causes the `include` and `exclude` lists to be processed after using source maps to determine the original filename of sources.
-   Add a file named 'index.json' to the .nyc_output/processinfo directory, which has a different format from the other files in this dir.
-   Change the data type of the pid/ppid fields in processinfo files
-   `nyc instrument` now honors `include` and `exclude` settings, potentially resulting in some files that were previously instrumented being ignored.
-   The `plugins` option has been renamed to `parser-plugins`.
-   The logic involving include/exclude processing has changed.  Results should be verified to ensure all desired sources have coverage data.
-   `nyc instrument` now enables the `--es-module` option by default.  This can cause failures to instrument scripts which violate `'use strict'` rules.

What's so different about retry-axios' implementation?

Hello.

I've been trying to get this wonderful interceptor all day but I just can't get it to work with my React app.

I have the following code.

```
export default{
  get(url, conf = {}) {
    const client = getClient();
    client.defaults.raxConfig = {
      retry: 5,
      instance: client,
      noResponseRetries: 5,
      statusCodesToRetry: [[100, 199], [400, 429],[500, 599]],
      onRetryAttempt: (err) => {
        const cfg = rax.getConfig(err);
        console.log(`Retry attempt #${cfg.currentRetryAttempt}`);
      }
    }
    const interceptorId = rax.attach(client)
    return client.get(url, conf)
  }
}
```


Basically another apiCall.js file calls the exported function, it creates an axios instance with some basic options via getClient(), attaches the raxConfig, attaches rax itself and then returns the get request.

The apiCall.js file then resolves the promises via .then() and .catch().

The problem im experiencing is no matter what I do retry-axios only retries once.

I know it uses the config because it properly reacts to changes in statusCodesToRetry, but doesn't do anything after the first retry.

I'm really desperate here and any help is appreciated.

I was going through the README docs and got up and running real quick, but then I hit a brick wall, and found retry-axios not working what so ever. After figuring out my mistake I wanted to point out where I ""went wrong"", either to help others who ran into similar issues, or to possibly improve the docs to prevent my mistakes from happening to others.

Currently the README has this snippet:
```javascript
const myAxiosInstance = axios.create();
myAxiosInstance.defaults = {
  raxConfig: {
    instance: myAxiosInstance
  }
}
const interceptorId = rax.attach(myAxiosInstance);
const res = await myAxiosInstance.get('https://test.local');
```
Which I used for my own setup, and found rax wasn't working, where the `onRetryAttempt` method wasn't being called. After struggling with all the retry-config settings I eventually changed my code to look this like:
```javascript
const myRaxConfig = {/*my settings*/};
const myAxiosInstance = axios.create();
myAxiosInstance.defaults.raxConfig = myRaxConfig;
const interceptorId = rax.attach(myAxiosInstance);
const res = await myAxiosInstance.get('https://test.local');
```

After-which retry-axios started working, and started calling the `onRetryAttempt` callback. 
It seems when doing this:
```javascript
myAxiosInstance.defaults = {
  raxConfig: {
    /*my rax config settings*/
  }
}
```
You take the following (rough) default axios configs:
```json
{
  ""transformRequest"": [
    null
  ],
  ""transformResponse"": [
    null
  ],
  ""timeout"": 0,
  ""xsrfCookieName"": ""XSRF-TOKEN"",
  ""xsrfHeaderName"": ""X-XSRF-TOKEN"",
  ""maxContentLength"": -1,
  ""headers"": {
    ""common"": {
      ""Accept"": ""application/json, text/plain, */*""
    },
    ""delete"": {},
    ""get"": {},
    ""head"": {},
    ""post"": {
      ""Content-Type"": ""application/x-www-form-urlencoded""
    },
    ""put"": {
      ""Content-Type"": ""application/x-www-form-urlencoded""
    },
    ""patch"": {
      ""Content-Type"": ""application/x-www-form-urlencoded""
    }
}
```
and set it to **just** the rax config. (as seen in the code-snippet at the top)

[Compare Source](https://renovatebot.com/gh/nock/nock/compare/v9.6.1...v10.0.0)

##### BREAKING CHANGES

-   drop official support for Node &lt; 6

There is no intentional change that breaks usage in Node 4, but as we
stop testing in this no longer supported Node version we recommend to
no update nock if you still rely on Node 4.

The reason why we decided to go ahead and make a breaking version
release is that it became increasingly harder to update dependencies
to the latest versions as they also drop support for Node 4.

##### Bug Fixes

-   **[#&#8203;1203](https://renovatebot.com/gh/nock/nock/issues/1203):** handle statusCode without payload ([21c255f](https://renovatebot.com/gh/nock/nock/commit/21c255f)), closes [#&#8203;1203](https://renovatebot.com/gh/nock/nock/issues/1203)

##### Code Refactoring

-   update Buffer constructors to from and alloc ([c94b89d](https://renovatebot.com/gh/nock/nock/commit/c94b89d))

##### Continuous Integration

-   **travis:** stop testing in Node 4 ([139b632](https://renovatebot.com/gh/nock/nock/commit/139b632))

The version **0.7.0** is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

If you don’t accept this pull request, your project will work just like it did before. However, you might be missing out on a bunch of new features, fixes and/or performance improvements from the dependency update.

It might be worth looking into these changes and trying to get this project onto the latest version of gts.

If you have a solid test suite and good coverage, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes directly by merging the proposed change into your project. If the build fails or you don’t have such unconditional trust in your tests, this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

<summary>Release Notes</summary>
<strong>0.7.0</strong>

<p>This release adds support for generating <code>.clang-format</code> and <code>tslint.json</code> in the target directory. The default implementations extend the gts configurations. If these files are not present we still fall back to the default gts provided config files.</p>
<p>This should enable editors to pickup the format and lint settings.</p>

The version **12.0.2** is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

If you don’t accept this pull request, your project will work just like it did before. However, you might be missing out on a bunch of new features, fixes and/or performance improvements from the dependency update.

It might be worth looking into these changes and trying to get this project onto the latest version of nyc.

If you have a solid test suite and good coverage, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes directly by merging the proposed change into your project. If the build fails or you don’t have such unconditional trust in your tests, this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

The version **5.0.0** is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

If you don’t accept this pull request, your project will work just like it did before. However, you might be missing out on a bunch of new features, fixes and/or performance improvements from the dependency update.

It might be worth looking into these changes and trying to get this project onto the latest version of @types/mocha.

If you have a solid test suite and good coverage, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes directly by merging the proposed change into your project. If the build fails or you don’t have such unconditional trust in your tests, this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

I think the problem is in the attached glift_combined.js line 12755; marksTheme
is undefined when stoneColor is BLACK_HOVER or WHITE_HOVER. Because after
Black's answer, 1-1 would be a ko point, addMark wants to put a ko marker there
in line 13275. It calls marksTheme.stroke, which crashes because marksTheme is
undefined.

Yes, the BLACK_HOVER/WHITE_HOVER themes have been somewhat problematic. I'll write up a fix.

For example in the following problem, you start as black but then after the AW/AB bits, your next move is played as white(!) and the problem automatically plays black's moves against you.

(The following SGF, incidentally, would be the ideal formulation of the problem in my opinion, as it would mean white's move, after the ladder plays itself out, is highlighted for you to respond to)

```
(;GM[1]FF[4]SZ[19]
AB[lh:mh][en:eo][fn][fp:gp]
AW[kh][mi][fo:go]
C[Black to play. Tenuki at T if the ladder is favorable for White.]LB[dd:T]
;B[ho];W[gn];B[gm];
AW[jk:jl][kk][il:im][hm:hn]
AB[jj][ik][lk][hl][kl][jm][in];
W[kj];B[ki];W[lj];B[mj];W[li];B[ni]C[Correct.])
```

I tried several variations on this, but I couldn't make a legitimate ladder problem with Glift. I certainly don't want to play each move by hand! 😁

For example, when white is the last one to play before the AW/AB nodes, as follows, then Glift doesn't add any of the AW/AB stones. It then marks any move by black as incorrect:

```
(;GM[1]FF[4]SZ[19]
AB[lh:mh][en:eo][fn][fp:gp]
AW[kh][mi][fo:go]
C[Black to play. Tenuki at T if the ladder is favorable for White.]LB[dd:T]
;B[ho];W[gn];B[gm];W[hn];
AW[kj:kk][jk:jl][il:im][hm]
AB[jj][ik][lk][hl][kl][jm][in];
B[ki];W[lj];B[mj];W[li];B[ni]C[Correct.])
```

If White passes immediately preceding the AW/AB, then Glift again doesn't add the AW/AB stones, and it's black's turn again, but anything you play is marked incorrect. (Even the correct move at B[ki], though you'd be hard pressed to find that given that the AW/AB stones hadn't been added)

```
(;GM[1]FF[4]SZ[19]
AB[lh:mh][en:eo][fn][fp:gp]
AW[kh][mi][fo:go]
C[Black to play. Tenuki at T if the ladder is favorable for White.]LB[dd:T]
;B[ho];W[gn];B[gm];W[];
AW[kj:kk][jk:jl][il:im][hm:hn]
AB[jj][ik][lk][hl][kl][jm][in];
B[ki];W[lj];B[mj];W[li];B[ni]C[Correct.])
```

If it's black's move immediately preceding and following the AW/AB, you still play as white after the middle of the ladder. Which on one hand is understandable because I'm sure Glift is alternating whose turn it is. But on the other, it's not what's in the SGF.

```
(;GM[1]FF[4]SZ[19]
AB[lh:mh][en:eo][fn][fp:gp]
AW[kh][mi][fo:go]

B[ki];W[lj];B[mj];W[li];B[ni]C[Correct.])
```

So I can't make it work. While I expect some improvements could be made to Glift's handling of AW/AB, any ideas for what I could use in the meantime?

Fairly straightforward changes to only listen to wrapping div. The more complicated part of this is adding a keyboard-indicator to show whether the glift box currently has focus.

I wasn't sure of the best way to pass `this.statusBar` object into the `initKeybindingListener`.  This feels a little janky, let me know how you'd like it.

> This currently binds keypress events to document.body, so it's not unlikely this could conflict with other applications' keybindings.

We should fix this so that glift can be happily embedded with more involved applications.  It does have a potential of causing problems for users if they don't give focus to glift.

On way to solve that design problem would be to have a keyboard icon that is solid when glift has focus, and greyed-out when it doesn't ?

This results in the browser literally displaying:

For SGF files with FF[1] through FF[3], lowercase letters are allowed in the property identifier names, but are simply ignored.

The EXAMPLE widget is nice because it simplifies the interface and removes distracting/confusing tools, and feels more like a book. The downside is that with very long numbered sequences, it can be hard for a user to interpret and visualize the sequence in their head, unless they're used to reading books and are already reasonably experienced with Go. Since examples aren't interactive, we quickly hit the limits of complexity in what can be displayed.

The GAME_VIEWER is nice because it lets the user step through a sequence move by move, making the content more accessible. The downside is that if there are many variations (assuming we have more than one variation in a single file), those will also be marked on the board and, regardless, the GAME_VIEWER widget displays more tools and has/will have more features than we might want in this scenario.

It would be very helpful to be able to display a bounded and unbranched sequence without having to create a new file for each one, with something like:

```
{
  ""url"": ""/example.sgf"",
  ""initialPosition"": ""0.3"",
  ""finalPosition"": ""0.3.0.1.0.0"",
  ""widgetType"": ""SEQUENCE""
}
```

The idea is that this would display a single line of play (probably starting at the end, or maybe that needs to be specified) and let the user move back and forth through the sequence as they wish without being exposed to unnecessary controls or variations.

This might be best as a separate widget type.

These formats are similar enough that the parser should be able to handle both of them. The dollar signs have limited meaning in our case, so we can easily strip them out.

One of the existing issues with these diagrams on sites like Sensei's Library is that move numbers in diagrams can only go up to 10 (represented by 0) after which you need to continue with a new diagram, where the previous moves have been flattened.

My experience is that this can be very frustrating and limiting, so I suggest that our implementation should support move numbers up to three digits in length (or maybe of arbitrary length) with (optional) zero padding to maintain a nice, human readable alignment.

While editing SGF files in the well known KGS editor, I realised there are more keywords which I find usable, and I wish these could also be displayed in the info window. I suggest the following improvements to this function:
- Show also rank of players. Ranks are given (if entered) as, for example, ""WR[3d]BR[4k]"" for WhiteRank=3D, BlackRank=4K. I suggest the ranks be shown in brackets after the players names.
- Show also ""Event"", i.e. the field EV, entered for example as ""EV[9th Korea Prime Minister Cup 2014]"".
- Show also the ""Round"", i.e. the filed RO, i.e. the round of the tournament. Entered as ""RO[1]"" for round=1.

Kashomon,glift,https://api.github.com/repos/Kashomon/glift/issues/49,41240964,MDU6SXNzdWU0MTI0MDk2NA==,49,Problem with widget loading when multiple SGF are loaded from files in 0.17.1,7741478,closed,FALSE,NA,NA,2,2014-08-27T01:34:05Z,2014-08-27T05:03:49Z,2014-08-27T05:03:49Z,NONE,NA,"**What happened**
When multiple widgets on the same page are loaded from SGF files, Glift 0.17.1 fails to load all of them correctly and seems to only load the last div properly.

Refreshing the page repeatedly results in intermittent behavior where widgets are sometimes displayed and sometimes the div is just white. Even when all widgets load (e.g. 2/2 in the example below), it seems that the widgets that weren't working load the same file as the widget that works consistently, instead of the file they were supposed to load. This results in x widgets displaying the same SGF, even when that wasn't the expected behavior.

As far as I can tell so far, this issue only exists when loading SGF data from an SGF file. If an SGF string is used instead, this issue doesn't occur and multiple SGF string widgets work with no problems (even when combined with file widgets that aren't working).

**Steps to reproduce**
To reproduce this, just create a page that loads two widgets from different SGF files.

Here's a link to a mockup that demonstrates the issue: https://s3.amazonaws.com/test.gogameguru.com/glift/glift-test.zip

It's assumed you'll extract the files to [webroot]/glift-test/ and run it on localhost, otherwise edit index.html to update the paths.

As a user, I'd expect this button to take me back to the last move before the branch I'm viewing (jumping straight back to the main variation could also be annoying).

The reason is the my (and most) windows machines do not have a /tmp folder. 
Easy enough to work around (by creating the c:\tmp folder).

They all source from github's repository of gitignores.

Here's the issue. The rules contained within a gitignore are not communative, they're read in an overwrite (final rule wins) fashion. So if you have a project that uses multiple technologies, the order of lines in a gitignore declaration is often important. Here's an example:

If you use `java.gitignore` then `gradle.gitignore` You'll have the following order of rules:

```
...
*.jar
...
!gradle-wrapper.jar
...
```

This is the correct way to declare it. You have a general rule and you have very acute exceptions after it. Gradle wants to include gradle-wrapper.jar, java wants to exclude the average jar. The problem arises when you use the gitignores in the opposite order. If you use `gradle.gitignore` then `java.gitignore` your rules will be ordered as such:

```
...
!gradle-wrapper.jar
...
*.jar
...
```

which means that all jars will be ignored, including gradle-wrapper.jar, despite the fact that you called it out to **not** be ignored.

So `joe java gradle` and `joe gradle java` are not the same command.

But, back to the key of this issue. github gitignores repo is not designed in a way to check that rules work together. Each file is its own standalone entity and if you're combining them, in-depth work needs to be taken to ensure your rules are correct - right now this is a manual process. I'd be exceptionally impressed if gitignores **were** tested in every possible combination. The issue is that any tool wanting to combine them needs to consider the actual values of each line in order to properly compose them, which may be difficult.

In the example above, there was a correct order... it might be easy to say ""well just get the order right"". But suppose there isn't a correct order. Say we have `foo.gitignore` which says:

```
lib/
!/bin/utility
```

and we have `bar.gitignore` which says:

```
bin/
!/lib/include/
```

Most people reading these two files could understand that the correct solution is to merge the two  and probably do something like this:

```
bin/
lib/
!/bin/utility
!/lib/include
```

But simply composing the files by placing one after another will result in incorrect behavior however you do it. The other issue is that while **I said** that this is the correct way to compose them, can you really know that without knowing what the files are? I can promise you there are edge cases where this isn't the right way, despite it being the most reasonable assumption from the given problem.

1. Open PowerShell to a new empty git repo
2. Create a file or folder (with a file in the folder) that should be ignored, such as a ""bin"" folder for the ""visualstudio"" template
3. Run `joe visualstudio > .gitignore` per the documentation in README
4. Run `git add .`
5. Run `git status`. Note that the ""bin"" folder has been added as a staged change, despite being ignored.

This is due to PowerShell using some UTF-8 marks that git doesn't like but for some reason git doesn't warn you. You can see this output in Atom, with some line ending issues as well (note the presumably Unicode-related marks at the beginning of the file):

 Note that if you run `echo ""bin/"" > .gitignore` it also doesn't work - so this is definitely a problem with either PowerShell or git, and not a problem with Joe. Also of note is that the piping works if this is run from Git Bash which is installed with Git for Windows. However, this means that either Joe should have functionality to create the .gitignore without redirecting standard output (such as a --create flag), and the documentation should at least be updated to note that redirecting output with `>` in PowerShell results in a file that is not usable by git. Unless there's some other way to work around this limitation in PowerShell.

This project is great  :+1: 

I have a question about generating the .gitignore file after reading other configuration file.

Does there any use case like bower?  If it does, maybe can add this function. :smile:

I found the simple comma separated list produced by `$ joe ls` a bit confusing since it is growing every month!
It can be helpful to provide a more formatted list to consult.

I made a simple function that takes as input the already sorted list and creates a table with capital letter headers. The table size depends on the size of the terminal.

I added the two optional attributes `-p` or `--pretty` combined with `ls` or `list`
`$ joe ls -p`

Hope you like it!

I looked into this behavior, and it turns out to be a bug in the Python 2.7 interpreter: the interpreter is not reporting an exception when failing to flush stdout.

How about adding in a parameter using an internal dictionary (the data type) containing all the available options and another parameter to specify the filename (since I saw that you're supporting other versions of .gitignore)?

Here's what I'm thinking:

`joe java .gitignore`

or

`joe java`

In both cases, it would increase code portability and allow potential scripting based on joe (eg adding it into a build script by calling the necessary .gitignore generator in joe automatically). All of this should still allow easy execution on the command line as-is.

In other words, can the actual output be made a part of the script instead of being dependent on a bash redirect?

An example is maybe like something simple such as states and capitals. Enter a state, and then give it's capital. Can make a database of that pretty easy in PostgreSQL (or really make it in excel, export it to CSV, then import to Postgres). Use a mid-tier like Java with Jersey and Tomcat/JBoss to deploy the server. The front end in JavaScript/HTML/CSS ofc or just XML if you don't care (probably gonna have the mid-tier make it into a JSON object for the front end to read), maybe even go further where the mid-tier makes it into a GeoJSON object that can be displayed using Leaflet.js.

I've read the contributing guideline and I thought I'd share some of my solutions to some Numbers projects. (Some have changed a lot, but some may be very similar to yours). The files can be found in this [repo](https://github.com/MrBlaise/learnpython)

The files are these:
## Numbers

[**Find PI to the Nth Digit**](https://github.com/MrBlaise/learnpython/blob/master/Numbers/pi.py) – Enter a number and have the program generate PI up to that many decimal places. No limit to the number of decimals

[**Fibonacci Value**](https://github.com/MrBlaise/learnpython/blob/master/Numbers/fibonacci_value.py) - Enter a number and have the program generate its Fibonacci value.

[**Fibonacci Sequence**](https://github.com/MrBlaise/learnpython/blob/master/Numbers/fibonacci.py) – Enter a number and have the program generate the Fibonacci sequence to that number.

[**Calculator**](https://github.com/MrBlaise/learnpython/blob/master/Numbers/calc.py) - A simple calculator to do the 4 basic operations (Later make it scientific).

[**Prime Factorization**](https://github.com/MrBlaise/learnpython/blob/master/Numbers/prime.py) – Have the user enter a number and find its prome factors. Extra: Show the exponent of each prime factor as well.

[**Next Prime Number**](https://github.com/MrBlaise/learnpython/blob/master/Numbers/next_prime.py) – Have the program generate prime numbers until the user chooses to stop.

After reading the paper, I have a question about pruning spans.

In section 5, the framework prunes the candidate spans during both **training and evaluation**. I think during evaluation is reasonable since the weights for word vectors are tuned. 

But during the early stage of training, the weights for word vectors are not learned (e.g., random initialized in the first epoch), could keeping top lambda*T spans ordered by mention scores discard potential valid mentions?

I really appreciate if you could assist me with this quesiton, I would like to convert the conll dataset format to NLI dataset format, in whcih one has one sentence, and replace the pronoun with each of the two antecedent, and then the correct one is entailment label and incorrect one is  contradiction. I have two questions:
- which information in the conll dataset your code uses? Do you also use cluster information and speaker id? I am really confused by all of these extra information and not sure if this is a part of your method. 
- I really appreciate to tell me how I can convert the conll dataset to the NLI format, is there any codes for this? 
- if one train the conll dataset like NLI with BERT model, do you think the performance could possibly suffer? I am wondering which extra information your code uses and if they have an impact?

Thanks for sharing good work. it's helping me to solve one my work called ""clustering/gathering sentences w.r.t entity"".
But I'm not able to use it for my domain(finance) data. so i am thinking of creating small amount (max ~500 samples/examples)of training data for same domain and then use transfer learning to learn. is it possible ? will it learn only with 500 examples or some minimum number of samples required ?

- OS: Ubuntu 18.04
- Virtual environment: Conda 4.7.5
- Python: 2.7.12 (this is the setup I used to get it to run; the problems described below appeared when I ran the project with Python 3.7.3)
- Tensorflow: 1.14.0
- CUDA toolkit: 10.0

### The problem

When run in a (conda) python3 environment, some of the scripts execute successfully but some still seem to require python2.

Specifically:
- **setup_all.sh** works fine
- Running **setup_training.sh** results in two issues:
  - _skeleton2conll.py_ from the conll scripts throws a syntax error at line 
    > except InvalidSexprException, e:
  - *get_char_vocab.py* throws a syntax error at 
    https://github.com/kentonl/e2e-coref/blob/10c6fb6b774b1a80724f6b7fdc68d743b6a88e99/get_char_vocab.py#L19
- Running **train.py** within a python3 environment throws the following error:
    > tensorflow.python.framework.errors_impl.NotFoundError: ./coref_kernels.so: undefined symbol: _ZN10tensorflow12OpDefBuilder4AttrESs

   The above symbol doesn't seem to exist in either the CPU or the GPU version of python3 TensorFlow (at least the versions available from pip an conda at the time of writing). While I could not find it in the python2 environment's TensorFlow either, the program still runs (maybe the symbol isn't called at all in the python2 version?).

### Proposed solution

I have created a pull request to fix the two issues encountered when running **setup_training.py**: #67 
Forcing a fallback to python2 for the problematic scripts allowed me to run the script even in a python3 environment.

Regarding the error in **train.py**, I'm not 100% sure that the Python version is the culprit.

### Solution
You can get `char_vocab.english.txt` from https://lil.cs.washington.edu/coref/char_vocab.english.txt; move this to the root of the repo; There should be 115 characters in this file. 

After that, just follow the instructions in readme -- download the pretrained model from google drive; and then run `python setup_all.py`, and you are good to go.

I'm trying to go through the README steps, to run `python demo.py final`

It seems like the latest commit removed the lines to curl char_vocab.english.txt. 
Doing `curl -o char_vocab.english.txt https://www.googleapis.com/storage/v1/b/e2e-coref/o/char_vocab.english.txt?alt=media` directly leaves me with an empty file though.

After that demo.py crashes at line 47 with a tensorshape mismatch in the coref_model.py at line 90.
 I suspect it might be related to my char_vocab.english.txt being empty?

Could you tell me how I could get this file?

I am trying to implement your module for a project that I am currently working on. And there's an issue that I am facing when I try to set it up as per the instructions given.

I am using Python 2.7 along with Tensorflow1.4.0 on a Ubuntu 16.04 LTS Base. I'm not really sure how to resolve this error, or where should I ideally look to resolve.

This seems to relate to the problem of cython as mentioned [here](https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/1955). 
However, updating to the lastest version of cython did not solve this problem. I'm using python3.7 with Cython version 0.29.14.

I've noticed some interesting errors when creating a pairwise potential with very small stddev for the feature comparison. Minimal example:
```python
import sys
import numpy as np
from pydensecrf import densecrf, utils

n = int(sys.argv[1])
s = float(sys.argv[2])

x = np.random.rand(1, n, n)
d = densecrf.DenseCRF2D(n, n, 2)
B = utils.create_pairwise_bilateral((30, 30), s, x, chdim=0)
print(""addPairwiseEnergy()"")
d.addPairwiseEnergy(B, 2.5)
print(""worked."")
```

When passing a small scale parameter (1e-8 and smaller), I can provoke different crashes:
```
$ python3 crfbug.py 64 1e-7
addPairwiseEnergy()
worked.
$ python3 crfbug.py 64 1e-8
addPairwiseEnergy()
worked.
double free or corruption (out)

$ python3 crfbug.py 128 1e-8

addPairwiseEnergy()
free(): invalid pointer

$ python3 crfbug.py 64 1e-10

```
The error message is not completely deterministic.

So in this case, it crashed at https://github.com/lucasb-eyer/pydensecrf/blob/0632813/pydensecrf/densecrf/src/permutohedral.cpp#L283, I also get crashes at line 255 or 284. All this seems like some memory is overwritten somewhere.

Running `valgrind --tool=memcheck --suppressions=valgrind-python.supp python3 crfbug.py 64 1e-8`, the first two relevant errors are:

Focusing on the latter, in https://github.com/lucasb-eyer/pydensecrf/blob/0632813/pydensecrf/densecrf/src/permutohedral.cpp#L255, it's writing beyond the array allocated in https://github.com/lucasb-eyer/pydensecrf/blob/0632813/pydensecrf/densecrf/src/permutohedral.cpp#L160, which is the `barycentric` array. So `barycentric[j*(d_+2)+p  ]` seems to be used with a too large index. This probably means that the `rank` array contained negative values?

Thanks for this great code. I am wondering how can I explicitly specify a kernal. In the readme file, you say there are three possible values for the kernel argument (i.e., CONST_KERNEL, DIAG_KERNEL (the default), and FULL_KERNEL) which specifies the kernel's precision-matrix Λ(m). Suppose I can precompute a Λ(m) and want to pass it when I call the addPairwiseEnergy() function, is there a way that I can do this?

I am confused on the Non-RGB cases, as the instance is presented on Greyscale images. Recently, I m using this wonderful package on an image has more than 3-channels. However, the CPP codes seem to indicate they are designed for RGB images, before the Python wrapping.  For example, the codes in

My code looks as following:

```
pil_im = np.asarray(Image.open('example_image.jpg', 'r'))
probs = model.predict(pil_im.reshape((1,1024,1024,3))/255)

                    kernel=dcrf.DIAG_KERNEL,
                    normalization=dcrf.NORMALIZE_SYMMETRIC)

```

I always get `res` to be matrix of `0.0` . I have tried following things:
1) Change it to use `2` channels with probability of foreground and background.
2) Changing `sdims` params.
3) Running inference longer.

Nothing helps and I always get matrix with `0.0` values.

If it helps, `pil_img` looks like [this](https://cdn1.imggmi.com/uploads/2018/4/23/d9bfd307c034ff63499985d061b3b7cf-full.png) and `probs` looks like [this](https://cdn1.imggmi.com/uploads/2018/4/23/ce6b0ed3108a09609b444c8c781adb66-full.png) after thresholding at `0.5`.
 
Also I tried to print KL values at each step of inference. Doesn't seem like it's improving at all.

Thank you for sharing this code. I have a deep learning classifier that specifies probability values for three classes at each pixel in an image. I would like to run the dense CRF to clean up my predictions. Here is the code that I'm trying to use.

`
# Define the CRF (width, height, nlabels)
# Predictions is a numpy array from my classifier, for a three class classification problem
d = dcrf.DenseCRF2D(predictions.shape[1], predictions.shape[0], 3)

# Unary potentials
U = predictions.reshape((3, -1))
d.setUnaryEnergy(-np.log(U))

# Pairwise potentials
d.addPairwiseGaussian(sxy=(3,3), compat=3, kernel=dcrf.DIAG_KERNEL, normalization = dcrf.NORMALIZE_SYMMETRIC)

# Inference
Q = d.inference(5)

map = np.argmax(Q, axis=0).reshape((predictions.shape[0], predictions.shape[1]))

proba = np.array(map)

# Write to a MAT file
scipy.io.savemat(""CRF_Predictions.mat"", mdict={'proba': proba})`

Here is my original predictions:

I am trying to apply dense CRF postprocessing to semantically labeled images (which are computed by deep learning techniques).  Reading the commits in this repository i saw that the **compat** parameter denotes the compatibility function mentioned in the paper which adopts the Potts model [ related commit: https://github.com/lucasb-eyer/pydensecrf/commit/a9d7be19fc1a149915a15f084e9936aec5a52cef ] 

However, I donot understand what does it mean to assign a constant value to this parameter. For example at the code below, what does it mean compatibility function is assigned as 3:

```
    d.addPairwiseGaussian(sxy=(3,3), compat=3,
                          kernel=dcrf.DIAG_KERNEL, normalization=dcrf.NORMALIZE_SYMMETRIC)

   d.addPairwiseBilateral(sxy=(30,30), compat=10,
                               kernel=dcrf.DIAG_KERNEL, normalization=dcrf.NORMALIZE_SYMMETRIC,
                               srgb=(3,3,3), rgbim=img[0])

```
Does it mean that only 3-pixel neighborhoods are considered to penalize differently labeled pixels? Because the equation given at the paper is mu(x_i,x_j) = 1 if x_i != x_j and 0 otherwise. So where we include that constant value in this equation???

In the 2011 paper (Eq. 2), the label compatibility matrix appears outside the sum over kernel responses.  However, both the `addPairwiseGaussian()` and `addPairwiseBilateral()` functions in the code accept an arbitrary label compatibility matrix.  By controlling the relative magnitude of the matrices, you can effectively set the kernel weights.

I'm trying to run pydensecrf for 3D case, but getting segmentation fault when I call inference. Here's how I'm running it (not sure if this is the correct way):
```
# probs of shape 3d image per class: Nb_classes x Height x Width x Depth
# assume the image has shape (69, 51, 72)
shape = image.shape
new_image = np.empty(shape)
d = dcrf.DenseCRF(np.prod(shape), probs.shape[0])
U = unary_from_softmax(probs)
d.setUnaryEnergy(U)
feats = create_pairwise_gaussian(sdims=(1.0, 1.0, 1.0), shape=shape)
d.addPairwiseEnergy(feats, compat=3, kernel=dcrf.FULL_KERNEL, normalization=dcrf.NORMALIZE_SYMMETRIC)
Q = d.inference(5) 
new_image = np.argmax(Q, axis=0).reshape((shape[0], shape[1],shape[2]))

I recently started using your wrapper for Phillip Krahenbuhl's fully connected CRFs.  Very useful -- thanks for making this available!

I'm working through a simple example, to make sure that I understand the usage, and I came across something a bit strange.  If I input an image that doesn't have 3 channels (eg, it could be grayscale, or a feature map with more than 3 channels), I get a nonsense output.  I understand that typical usage would be for RGB images, but is there a way to use images without exactly 3 channels?

Here is a gist with an example: https://gist.github.com/DaveRichmond-/3d4b45f06a1fedb2527dae3a0856b213

But I have some questions when I use this code.

My task is to cluster some points, not image. Here some points are connected but some are not. Say, I have 100 points. So I build a crf model by code below(in your demo).

d = dcrf.DenseCRF(100, 5)  # npoints, nlabels

feats = np.array(...)  # Get the pairwise features from somewhere.
print(feats.shape)     # -> (7, 100) = (feature dimensionality, npoints)
print(feats.dtype)     # -> dtype('float32')

dcrf.addPairwiseEnergy(feats)

My question is, here how could I set the point connectivity？　For example, point 1 is connected with point 2, but not point 3. Can I set the edge?
If I can't, does this mean that all the points are connected?

I squashed all my mini-changes into a big commit (other repositories like to do that).

I tried a fresh install into a virtualenv and it seemed to work fine. So unless I messed-up with my git manipulations, this should solve the issue.

Note that setup.py will also install pydensecrf.util as required.

I created my own playground applications to use it. Maybe `util_inference_example.py` should be moved of the package, and have it call `import pydensecrf.densecrf` and `import pydensecrf.utils`; so as to show the proper use of the library.

First off: thanks for providing this code - it has been very helpful for me.

I have made some reasonably big changes - not fixes - but a new mode of operation. I have no idea if you'll be interested in them, but I I just wanted to let you know. Because I have changed the way the script works (not email based any more) it didn't feel like a pull request was suitable.

My requirement was to have the markdown version created in Google Drive alongside the original document (in a ""markdown"" folder) - instead of being emailed. I also needed to enable hyperlinking from one document to another in the same directory or a sub directory. The code now looks at all links - if these refer to a document in the same directory or a sub directory then the absolute link is replaced by just a relative path name. It will also automatically (recursively) process the file being referenced - thus if you process a top level file and this links to a number of sub-files then all of the files will be processed and markdown versions created - all with suitable internal links. All in all this enables large multi-file documentation packages to be maintained in Google Drive then easily exported to Markdown files.

My version is available here:
https://gist.github.com/bafta-benj/a5c432e5957ba48f98007fb802f48ca4

If this is of interest let me know - I've only just finished it and haven't used it much so there will probably be some tweaks/fixes over the next couple of weeks.

All the best

Thanks for the converter - just what we needed to get a more useful document format out of Google Drive!

We had some minor problems with the export, where some of our documents had odd italic and bold formatting, which covered leading/trailing whitespace (sometimes even JUST whitespace, e.g. a single ""italic"" space between words). Since this is invisible in the original documents it's hard to correct.

Commit c72c363 deals with this by shrinking the regions of bold and italic formatting to remove leading/trailing whitespace, which removes useless formatting and also makes the output more compliant with markdown.

I've also included commits to make the converter more flexible, by allowing exporting to new files in your drive, and to use a new mimeType so that e.g. stackedit.io will see the files. This also means that when they are downloaded, they have just an ""md"" extension, not "".md.txt"". Finally, it makes nested italic and bold a little neater by breaking up the asterisks so it's easier to read.

Let me know if you would prefer a pull request for just the italic/bold. I've also got a Drive document with some examples of odd formatting that is fixed by the changes. I don't think the changes should break anything, but I could have missed a possibility.

Thanks,
Ben.

I can obviously change the text between brackets in line 110, but I can't figure out how to create a loop function that would (a) number each footnote with a different number (continuing numbering preferred, of course) and (b) force a line brake in Markdown before the second [^1] with the actual content of the footnote. That would make the final Markdown document capable of being processed by Pandoc easily and beautifully. Would highly appreciate ideas regarding this and would love to check the code after that becaues --as I said-- I am sure it is EASY as HELL. Regards!

thanks for this project, it seems to work very well : ).

Quick Question: Would you be interested in making the library backwards compatible so that it could be imported by go projects that haven't upgraded to go modules yet? This would mainly involve creating a v2 directory inside of the repository and moving the v2 code into a v2 directory as recommended here: https://blog.golang.org/v2-go-modules#TOC_3.

---

What I mean is that the code below works fine as long as you have `go.mod` file in your project.

```go
package main

import (
	""fmt""
	""github.com/maruel/panicparse/v2/stack""
)

func main() {
	fmt.Printf(""%#v\n"", stack.Goroutine{})
}
```

However, if you don't have a `go.mod` file, you get an error like this:

```
main.go:6:2: cannot find package ""github.com/maruel/panicparse/v2/stack"" in any of:
	/usr/local/Cellar/go/1.15.6/libexec/src/github.com/maruel/panicparse/v2/stack (from $GOROOT)
	/Users/bob/go/src/github.com/maruel/panicparse/v2/stack (from $GOPATH)
```

If you're interested, I might be able to send you patch for this, but I figured I reach out first to see how you feel about it.

No worries if you decide you don't want this compatibility, your work on this is much appreciated either way : ).

For each of `GOROOT` and `GOPATH`:

- Build Go executable on CI at path /x
- Runs Go executable on prod at path /y
- Devs checkout sources at path /z

## Current state

There's currently an hard coded variable of 'well known goroots' in [stack/stack.go#L63](https://github.com/maruel/panicparse/blob/master/stack/stack.go#L63) to help disambiguation for GOROOT. It's a cheap effort at best. There's no such guessing for GOPATH.

## Design

Be more 'smarty pants' about guessing both GOROOT and GOPATH. The way to achieve this is to spot check files in the stack trace, and try to match the two roots by finding the exact match of files. If an exact match is found, use this to rebase the paths. 

That said, this kind of 'smart' behaviour can occasionally be counter productive, so a single boolean flag has be provided to disable this completely, i.e. `-norebase`

## Rejected alternatives

A naive implementation would be to add two flags to handle absolute path rebasing of `GOROOT` and `GOPATH`, e.g. `-goroot <path>` and `-gopath <path>`. Doing so will be error prone for users, and most users wouldn't realize they need to calculate the values, leading to no source parsing, which is currently the case for the use case above.

Hm; truth said, it could also be nice if 3rd-party libs were marked with a distinct color/marker, too... but then detection can be difficult here: one has them in .../vendor/..., other in ../Godeps/..., other in ""everything except $GOPATH/mycompany.com/... and $GOROOT/src/..."".

- Some Go users use terminal with white background. I suspect this is mostly caused by OSX's Terminal defaults. I expect little to no Linux and Windows users to use white background.
  - Terminal with white background makes yellow and light gray hard to read: http://i.imgur.com/WqNVjfh.png
- Some people cannot distinguish green-red. This is a bigger non-self inflected problem.

Options:
1. Make the color palette configurable via an environment variable.
2. Force the background to be black. This would look like hell but would be readable yet very annoying.
3. Try to read the background color and switch color table dynamically (no idea how to achieve this).
4. Change the current colors to use a palette that is both readable with black and white backgrounds.

I think option 1 is preferable but it still has the drawback of not working out of the box, requiring reading the help page, then taking action to make the change permanent. This is clumsy and annoying.

So in the meantime, option 4 is more sensible. I need to play with both 256 and 16 colors terminals to ensure I do not make things worse.

I took a large (20k lines) goroutine dump from a server and I used panicparse to analyze it. Unfortunately panicparse still emits many thousands of lines because lots of goroutines that are the same for my purposes cannot be deduplicated.

I dug into it more and I found two specific issues:
1. Panicparse compares argument values and if it doesn't think they're pointers, it wants the values to be the same. For my purposes, I really don't care about function args; I want two goroutines to be deduped if they have the same stack trace.
   
   In case it helps, here are two lines from two different goroutines that caused them to not be deduped (this is deep in `net`'s inner workings, far away from my own code):
   
   ```
   io.copyBuffer(0x7fa5add90238, 0xc820106aa0, 0x7fa5addd01d8, 0xc820106a60, 0xc820166000, 0x8000, 0x8000, 0x38bd, 0x0, 0x0)
   io.copyBuffer(0x7fa5add90238, 0xc820028220, 0x7fa5addd01d8, 0xc820152148, 0xc820a80000, 0x8000, 0x8000, 0x98d, 0x0, 0x0)
   ```
   
   My quick hack was to modify my local copy of stack.go to consider two `Args` to be similar if they have the same number of args (without looking at the args):
   
   ``` go
   func (a *Args) Similar(r *Args) bool {
     return a.Elided == r.Elided && len(a.Values) == len(r.Values)
   }
   ```
2. If a goroutine has been blocked for a long time on e..g a channel op or IO, it prints something like
   
   ```
   goroutine 134103 [chan send, 609 minutes]:
   ```
   
   or
   
   ```
   goroutine 134227 [IO wait, 747 minutes]:
   ```
   
   A difference in # of minutes causes two goroutines not to be deduped. My quick hack here was to modify my trace file with a quick `s/\d+ minutes/123 minutes/`. A more robust solution would be for panicparse to merge multiple values by replacing with `* minutes` (as with merged function params) or, if we want to be fancy, something like `(12-49) minutes`.

I wanted to bring these issues to your attention and see what you think a good solution might be. I'm not sure if, for other people in other contexts, having goroutines not be disambiguated for the above two reasons is useful. If so, perhaps there could be a flag for even more aggressive deduplication.

This is not optimal. Conceptually to the user, there was only one argument, not two. But the compiler sees only the low level arguments.

By having panicparse process the source files, it could instead print:

panicparse must fallback to the current behavior when source files are unavailable or line numbers do not match exactly with what is in the trace.

I wonder what would be the reason for this error.

I was using pyhsmm/rslds package with an autoregressive extension on my laptop on Mojave without any problem. But now using a new iMac with Catalina (I presume there can be many changes but most prominent change). 

I tried installing and reinstalling Xcode, brew installed gcc, llvm, limomp. However, nothing worked.

I tried the no-complied version. It seemed installed but giving an error when importing it (at __init__.py importing models).

Any solution would be appreciated. Thank you.

If `D` is set as the maximum segment length, then the state corresponding to some smaller segment must also last for `D` time to jump to the next state? Compared with HMM, will the result be worse?

I have been using hmmlearns GMMHMM (https://hmmlearn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#gmmhmm) for learning hmms where state distributions are gaussian mixtures to better approximate my data. I am now trying to build a similar model with pyhsmm except with the HDP and semi-markovian extensions but I am running into some problems applying EM_fit.

Here is the model set-up for some 2D data X:

 ```
   obs_dim = X.shape[1]
    obs_hypparams = {'mu_0':np.zeros(obs_dim),
                    'sigma_0':np.eye(obs_dim),
                    'kappa_0':0.25,
                    'nu_0':obs_dim+2}
    dur_hypparams = {'alpha_0':2*30,
                     'beta_0':2}
    alpha_0 = 5.0
    # Distributions
    mixture_dist = pyhsmm.distributions.MixtureDistribution(alpha_0 = alpha_0, components = [pyhsmm.distributions.Gaussian(**obs_hypparams) for itr in range(nMix)])
    obs_distns = [mixture_dist for state in range(n_components)]
    dur_distns = [pyhsmm.distributions.PoissonDuration(**dur_hypparams) for state in range(n_components)]
    # Build the iHSMM model that will represent the fitmodel
    model = pyhsmm.models.WeakLimitHDPHSMM(
            #alpha=6.,gamma=6., # these can matter; see concentration-resampling.py
            alpha_a_0=1.,alpha_b_0=1./4,
            gamma_a_0=1.,gamma_b_0=1./4,
            init_state_concentration=6., # pretty inconsequential
            obs_distns=obs_distns,
            dur_distns=dur_distns)
    model.add_data(X)#,trunc=60) # duration truncation speeds things up when it's possible
    # Gibbs sampling for initialization
    for idx in progprint_xrange(nGibbsSamples):
        model.resample_model()
    # EM fit
    likes = model.EM_fit()

```

Now as far as I can tell my model set-up for this distribution is correct and the Gibbs sampling seems to work, although when running model.EM_fit() I get the error:

So it looks like EM for mixture models has not been incorporated into pyhsmm yet? If so is this something that will be added soon or is work in progress? If this is not going to be added could you please point me in the right direction as to what exactly needs adding to get this to work (as much detail as possible please, first time using these models!)? I guess max_likelihood() must be altered to properly compute likelihoods for mixture models??

Fox dissertation 2009.

The change reparameterized `alpha` and `kappa` as `(alpha+kappa)` and `rho=kappa/(kappa+alpha)`. We place a Gamma prior over `(alpha+kappa)` and a Beta prior over `rho`. The `WeakLimitStickyHDPHMM` class is updated to allow the new hyper-parameters. Further, the new classes are added to the transitions.py class to include ""FullConcGibbs"" classes to indicate that we are now sampling over all of the hyper-parameters in the model (rather than just the alpha and gamma parameters as before).

I ran the updated model on `example-data.txt` following the code in `hsmm.py` (changing the relevant model to:
```
posteriormodel = pyhsmm.models.WeakLimitStickyHDPHMM(
                    gamma_a_0=1,
                    gamma_b_0=1/4,

                    init_state_concentration=1,
                    obs_distns=obs_distns)
```

The result is that we now have a posterior over kappa:
`plt.hist([m.trans_distn.kappa for m in models])`:

It looks like future is not installed by default in anaconda's distribution of python, so that pip install pyhsmm
fails, unless I first install future manually.

Second, I was looking at the paper ""The Infinite Hidden Markov Model"" by Beal et. al.  The first example that they give is of the string 30*'ABCDEFEDCB', and remark that the most parsimonious HMM which models this has 10 states.  I'm assuming that the WeakLimitHDPHMM will essentially run their algorithm (of course I have to give a maximum number of states).   I defined the following function:
```python
def trainHDPHMM(data, Nmax, iterations=100, alpha_0=1.0, alpha_size=None):
    if alpha_size is None:
        alpha_size = 1+max(data)
    print(""Alphabet size=%d""% alpha_size)
    obs_hyperparams = {
        'alpha_0': alpha_0,
        'K': alpha_size
        }
    obs_distns = [pyhsmm.distributions.Categorical(**obs_hyperparams) for state in range(Nmax)]
    posteriormodel = pyhsmm.models.WeakLimitHDPHMM(
        alpha_a_0=1., alpha_b_0=0.25,
        gamma_a_0=1., gamma_b_0=0.25,
        init_state_concentration=1.,
        obs_distns=obs_distns)
    posteriormodel.add_data(data)
    for idx in progprint_xrange(iterations):
        posteriormodel.resample_model()
    return posteriormodel
```
When I call this using

```python
model = trainHDPHMM(np.array(map(lambda _: ord(_) - ord('A'), 30*'ABCDEFEDCB')), 40)
```
It sometimes (it depends on the random seed) gets a traceback like (even though I've done
np.seterr(divide='ignore'))

I see that this issue was brought up in https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/5851 over 2 years ago, but it still doesn't seem to have been fixed (I'm running numpy version 1.31.1).  Is there a workaround (or fix) for this?

But now to what I'm really interested in:

In the paper ""Particle Gibbs for Infinite Hidden Markov Models"" by Tripuraneni et. al. (in NIPS 2015) they describe a method using particle Gibbs to resample the state trajectory which, they say, greatly sped up apparent convergence.  On one model that I'm running I find that I'm still improving, very gradually, even after 20,000 sampling iterations, so I'm interested in trying it.  So, what changes would I need to make (more importantly, where) to pyshmm and/or pybasicbayes to add using particle gibbs as an option?

Despite showing different emissions, they are all one color because only the latest state seems to be recorded at the end of training.  After digging into it a bit, looks like the HMMSVI class uses states_list for each minibatch instead of for storing the global HMMStatesEigen object.  I tried changing `_get_mb_states_list` in the _HMMSVI definition in models.py to add the last state from states_list instead of popping it off, as follows:

```
def _get_mb_states_list(self,minibatch,**kwargs):
    minibatch = minibatch if isinstance(minibatch,list) else [minibatch]
    mb_states_list = []
    for mb in minibatch:
            self.add_data(mb,generate=False,**kwargs)
            mb_states_list.append(self.states_list[-1])
        return mb_states_list

This resulted in the following plot, where the left side looks as expect and the right is a mess, likely due to plotting every overlapping state sequences:

I've been looking to your examples and code and I was hoping that you could answer a few questions.

Right now, I trying to implement a very simple model: a 1D signal with 2 states and the observation models of each state is a univariate Gaussian. Then, I want to train the model and use the Viterbi algorithm to determine the states.

So I did the following:
# create model

trans_matrix = transition_model() # 2x2 matrix
mu_1, sigma_1, mu_2, sigma_2  = observational_model_pyhsmm() 

N = 2 # number of states

obs_distns = [pyhsmm.distributions.ScalarGaussianNIX(mu_1, sigma_1^2), pyhsmm.distributions.ScalarGaussianNIX(mu_2, sigma_2^2)]

pi_0 = np.array([0.8, 0.2])
# Build the HMM model

model = pyhsmm.models.HMM( trans_matrix=trans_matrix, pi_0 = pi_0, obs_distns=obs_distns)
# fit model

for sample in all_samples:
    model.add_data(sample)

model.EM_fit(tol=1e-9, maxiter=1e8)
# test model

pred = model.heldout_viterbi(distance_frame)

My questions are:
1) Am I passing the transition and initial distributions (in the form of array) correctly to the model?
2) There are other Gaussian models, like 'ScalarGaussianNonconjNIX', 'ScalarGaussianNonconjNIG'x, 'ScalarGaussianFixedvar', what are the differences between these?
3) I have several signals for training, do I have to pass each signal one by one, or is there a method to pass all the signal at once?
4) To use the Viterbi algorithm, is 'heldout_viterbi' the correct method?

5) For a observation model of mixture of multivariate Gaussians the examples present the following parameters:

obs_hypparams = {'mu_0':np.zeros(obs_dim),
                              'sigma_0':np.eye(obs_dim),
                              'kappa_0':0.25,
                              'nu_0':obs_dim+2}

a) Is kappa_0 the weight of each component of the GMM? 
b) Is nu_0 the number of components of the GMM?
c) What is the difference of mu, sigma and mu_0 and sigma_0?  

Sorry for the long post.

I ran your example, and besides the plot of the various 2-dimensional distributions, how can I get the actual posterior estimates of the following:

Is there anyway to plot the samples of the duration, so as to see the sampled distribution?

Not sure if it's a feature of the HDP-HMM (or my hyperparameters) or if it's a software issue. I ran pyhsmm on discrete (binary) outputs and fed it strongly periodic data, i.e.: `0,1,0,1,0,1....` and asked it to predict next 10 outputs.

In a 2-hidden state (parametric) Bayesian HMM, there would be two hypotheses: (1) the data were produced by a single hidden state that emits 1 with probability 0.5, or (2) the data were produced by a periodic transitioning between two hidden states, one which emits 1 with probability ~1.0, and another that emits 0 with probability ~1.0. If you had a sparse prior on the emission matrix, but less sparse prior on the transition matrix, you'd favor hypothesis 2 and your posterior would predict periodic observations.

pyhsmm doesn't predict the periodic trend even with a larger set of observations, as far as I can tell. It also uses the max number of states (~25) which seems too large for this data. Is because of my hyperparameter settings? Is it possible to get better inferences by forcing sparsity on the observation matrix and using more concentrated priors for the global HDP?

I attach plots of predicted posteriors from two independent runs (same settings). My code is below. Thanks!

This demo shows how HDP-HMMs can fail when the underlying data has state
persistence without some kind of temporal regularization (in the form of a
sticky bias or duration modeling): without setting the number of states to be
the correct number a priori, lots of extra states can be intsantiated.

BUT the effect is much more relevant on real data (when the data doesn't exactly
fit the model). Maybe this demo should use multinomial emissions...

Hi,

I am using pyhsmm for a research project (thanks for making this public, it's awesome!) and I wanted to use a slightly different observation distribution, or rather different prior on the observation distribution, namely a scaled inverse whishart or separated correlation/variance matrices (see http://www.themattsimpson.com/2012/08/20/prior-distributions-for-covariance-matrices-the-scaled-inverse-wishart-prior/) as a prior for the covariance matrices.

My questions is whether this can be done just by extending the Gaussian class in pybasicbayes (https://github.com/mattjj/pybasicbayes/blob/master/pybasicbayes/distributions/gaussian.py), or do I have to change things inside of the Gibbs sampler as well?

If extending the Gaussian class is enough, which functions need to be implemented/changed. Would mirroring IsotropicGaussian be enough despite the '# TODO collapsed, meanfield, max_likelihood' ?

Happy to make a pull request back into the project if I get it to work :)

I successfully (at least I think I have) installed pyhsmm and pybasicbayes.

I did try to run all the examples from the directory ""..pyhsmm/examples/"", but I could not make some of them to work.

As you might tell, this is my first time using python and I believe I am missing something fundamental here, so I apologize in advance for my dumb questions hoping for a trivial solution. 

The following are the issues I  encountered when running some of the examples in pyhsmm and pybasicbayes.

1)  when running pyhsmm/examples/hmm-separatetrans.py
     AttributeError: 'HMMSeparateTrans' object has no attribute 'trans_distn'

2)  when running pyhsmm/examples/hsmm-possiblechangepoints-meanfield.py
AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'DiagGaussGMMHSMMPossibleChangepointsSeparateTrans' 

3)  when running pyhsmm/examples/hsmm-possiblechangepoints-separatetrans.py
AttributeError: 'HSMMPossibleChangepointsSeparateTrans' object has no attribute 'init_state_distn'

4)  when running pyhsmm/examples/hsmm-possiblechangepoints.py
AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'DiagGaussGMMHSMMPossibleChangepointsSeparateTrans'

5) When running pybasicbayes/examples/EM-demo.py

```
data = data if data else [None]*len(weights)
```

ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()   

6) When running animation.py
the program keeps  dumping number and labels on the screen indefinetely.                        

Please find below full trace for 1-5 of the above, any suggestion you might have on how to solve these would be very much appreciated.
Best regards

is there anything wrong in my raw data not to meet the model's data specification? or  is this a inherenet error of this model? maybe I should change other random seed?

A couple of other changes in this pull request:
1. Moved `deps/` outside of `pyhsmm/pyhsmm/` 
2. Added a `clean` option to `setup.py` that removes Cython-generated code (*.cpp, *.c, *.so) and build-related files. Intended to be used only by developers - very useful for testing code. Note that this relies on all the .cpp/.c files in `pyhsmm/` being Cython-generated.
3. Removed Cython from being an installation dependency of pyhsmm. It's not necessary for automatic installations like from pypi
4. Added notes for developers in `developer_notes.md` - if these are useful they can be incorporated into the README.md or to a separate developer's pyhsmm guide if you make one.

Here's how I tested the source distribution creation/installation:

```
# get rid of old stuff
python setup.py clean
# make source distribution 
python setup.py sdist 
# send dist/pyhsmm-0.x.x.tar.gz to a fresh box
# ...
# try to install it on fresh box
tar -xzvf pyhsmm-0.x.x.tar.gz
cd pyhsmm-0.x.x/
# this will install by compiling Cython-generated source code, without needing Cython or using *.pyx files at all
pip install .
```

To test the installation from the github repo, I just did:

```
# in github repository pyhsmm/
python setup.py clean 
pip install .
```

This will apply Cython to the *.pyx files to generate the cpp code, and then install the package.

If both of these work, then we're good for both the automatic installation with pip and the developer's build case.

If that sounds good you, I can make a similar fix for `pybasicbayes` (to make it handle Cython correctly), and then add travis CI support for `pyhsmm` to make the testing more streamlined. The only missing ingredient then would be a unit testing main driver script.

I can try to fix it while integrating travis. Relying on custom flags like `--with-cython` I think is a bad idea, because package mangers won't know about these. It also seems like the flag is unnecessary. `python setup.py build_ext` or `python setup.py sdist` can figure out if Cython needs to be called and if so run it.

The previous version didn't include the *.pyx files in the distribution, and so the package from pypi would install correctly but would not compile the Cython files.

For now, I included the Cython files and associated headers through `MANIFEST.in`. This will make it so when you install the package from pypi, the installation procedure automatically compiles the Cython files. A more ideal solution would be to write a conditional in the `setup.py` that checks if Cython is present, and if so, compiles the Cython files. For developers who want to make a distribution with `python setup.py sdist`, only the Cython-generated *.c files would go in the distribution, and then users could install with just Python and a C compiler, without needing Cython. (This more ideal setup is described here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4505747/how-should-i-structure-a-python-package-that-contains-cython-code). Since your users are mostly expert developers who probably have Cython, I figured it's not pressing.

One caveat to watch out for: if you compile your pyx files to make *.c files, and have something that includes all *.c files in `MANIFEST.in`, you could accidentally package a Cython generated, e.g.  foo.c along with a foo.pyx file. That could might create a situation where only the foo.c gets used even if it's out of date with the foo.pyx file. So to be on safe side, best to wipe out all Cython generated files before making a source distribution, i.e. before running `python setup.py sdist`. 

I fixed this in `pybasicbayes` too, see other pull request. 

It'd be great if you could make a fresh source distribution and upload it to pypi. You could wipe out the previous one through the pypi admin settings, or upgrade the VERSION variable in setup.py and make a new version release. I'm sure that if you wipe out the previous one and replace it without changing the version, you won't upset anyone, it has only been out for a few hours :)

If I delete the parameter on that line, I get another error (included at the bottom because it's long). Since it was related to pybasicbayes I tried reverting to old commits, but none of them seem to work.

Any ideas? I'm on Linux, as far as I know all my libraries are freshly installed and up to date.

After a few days of various combinations of python environments and difficulties with the pyhsmm install, I thought I would check in to see if I there was something I could do that would be more successful.  Here's the steps I've taken:

2) Install Anaconda-2.0.1-Windows-x86_64
3) Download pyhsmm
4) Install pyhsmm:
        python setup.py build_ext --inplace
5) Errors during compile of first cpp file: hmm_messages_interface.cpp: 
        ""::hypot not defined""
6) From http://bugs.python.org/issue11566:
        add #include cmath earlier than python.h, i.e., at the top of   hmm_messages_interface.cpp
7) ""::hypot"" error no longer appears, but the next one remains: 
""error: invalid conversion from '__pyx_t_5numpy_int32_t\* {aka long int_}' to 'int_' [-fpermissive]""

I don't see a quick fix to that one in the searches that I've done.

Below is the full install console output.  You will notice that I am using the gcc that comes with Anaconda (4.7.0). You do suggest using 4.8 and a quick check of using that instead gave the same errors.

Any thoughts would be most appreciated,
Phil

I'm running into a similar issue as https://github.com/mattjj/pyhsmm/issues/21. I'm on OS X 10.9.3, and I'm using clang (Apple LLVM version 5.1 (clang-503.0.40) (based on LLVM 3.4svn)).

I tried building in two ways specified by the README but both failed for me.

First I tried:

$ python setup.py build_ext --inplace
running build_ext
gcc-4.2 not found, using clang instead
building 'internals.hmm_messages_interface' extension
clang -fno-strict-aliasing -fno-common -dynamic -arch i386 -arch x86_64 -g -O2 -DNDEBUG -g -O3 -Ideps/Eigen3/ -I/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/Extras/lib/python/numpy/core/include -I/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/include/python2.7 -c internals/hmm_messages_interface.cpp -o build/temp.macosx-10.6-intel-2.7/internals/hmm_messages_interface.o -O3 -w -DNDEBUG -std=c++11 -DHMM_TEMPS_ON_HEAP

I also tried the suggested alternative for clang but got:

I was failing to get this to install/run on both os x 10.9 and ubuntu with the recommended:

```
cd pyhsmm
python setup.py build_ext --inplace
```

Followed by either `python setup.py install` or `cp -r pyhsmm /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/`.

So I decided to try and fix the repo to make it properly install.

Here is the ordered list of what I've done thus far (from inside the cloned pyhsmm folder, on a relatively fresh install of Mavericks, with numpy/scipy/matplotlib already setup):

```
change setup.py:
pyhsmm.util.cyutil
setup(
    name='pyhsmm',
    url='https://github.com/mattjj/pyhsmm',
    packages=['pyhsmm', 'pyhsmm.basic', 'pyhsmm.basic.pybasicbayes', 'pyhsmm.basic.pybasicbayes.util', 'pyhsmm.basic.pybasicbayes.internals', 'pyhsmm.plugins', 'pyhsmm.util', 'pyhsmm.internals', 'pyhsmm.testing'],
    ext_modules=ext_modules,
    include_dirs=[np.get_include(),],
)

mkdir pyhsmm
mv __init__.py pyhsmm/
mv basic/ pyhsmm/
mv deps/ pyhsmm/
mv examples/ pyhsmm/
mv internals/ pyhsmm/
mv models.py pyhsmm/
mv parallel.py pyhsmm/
mv testing/ pyhsmm/
mv util/ pyhsmm/
cd pyhsmm/deps
mkdir eigen_build
cd eigen_build
homebrew install cmake
cmake ../Eigen3/
sudo make install
cd ../../../

change hmm_messages.h, hsmm_messages.h, nptypes.h ==> include <eigen3/Eigen/Core>
prepend pyhsmm. to pyhsmm/models.py (including line 267)
prepend pyhsmm.basic to pyhsmm/basic/models.py
prepend pyhsmm.basic.pybasicbayes. to all imports from files in pyhsmm/basic/pybasicbayes/
prepend pyhsmm. to all imports in pyhsmm/__init__.py
prepend pyhsmm.internals. to line 1044 of pyhsmm/internals/states.py

python setup.py build_ext --inplace
python setup.py install

cd pyhsmm/examples
python hsmm.py
```

The result is an error:

```

    from pyhsmm.internals.hsmm_messages_interface import messages_backwards_log
ImportError: No module named hsmm_messages_interface
```

Unlike the other errors I've gotten along the way, I don't know how to fix this one. All there is in `internals` is `hsmm_messages_interface.cpp` and `hsmm_messages_interface.pyx` -- and it seems like I'm unable to get pyximport to help me out with finding the interface anywhere.

Any ideas how to get the import to work? Or is there a different, known way to install the package on OS X?

The state is saved and available on Jefferson.
### Observations

`betal` and `betastarl` are almost entirely NaN, this is obviously the symptom we're working backwards from.

Starting with the invalid value in subtract, warning, the arrays are — 

`aDl[possible_durations-1]` and `normalizer`.
The values in `normalizer` are all very small — 

``` python
array([  9.16634958e-16,  -2.84332720e-16,   8.35406888e-16,
        -1.16364025e-16,  -6.25881334e-16,  -1.14210176e-16,
        -8.92706352e-16,   2.06959016e-16,  -5.26356327e-16,

        -3.14779159e-16,  -4.72816793e-16,  -8.54616895e-16,
         4.20530006e-16,   6.07096070e-16,   2.74158877e-16,
        -9.29066769e-16,  -1.66557099e-15,   6.49373531e-16,
        -2.19957675e-17,   9.41834127e-16,  -8.53563725e-16,
        -4.33727380e-17,   1.78639797e-16,  -1.08130825e-15,
         3.45001062e-16,  -1.33058494e-15,  -9.29004361e-16,
         1.73516054e-16,  -1.98350807e-16,  -3.82846601e-18,

         5.29904454e-16])
```

The values in aDl are fine, except for the first seven entries, which are negative infinity — 

``` python
>>> print np.isinf(aDl).sum(1)[:100]
array([40, 40, 39, 36, 35, 34, 26, 24,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,
        0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,
        0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,
        0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,
        0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,
        0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0])
```

I suppose this means that having a changepoints at the very beginning of the data sequence are impossible under the model, which would make sense for the first frame, but is puzzling that it continues into further frames. 

Interestingly, spacing changepoints every 9, 10 or 100 frames works. However, spacing by 8 or fewer frames does not work, and results in the same first 7 frames containing `-inf`. 

Offsetting the first changepoint by providing changepoints as `zip(range(10,len(data),1), range(11,len(data)-1,1))` results in the same error.

@mattjj, if I want to compare between possiblechangepoint and  non-possiblechangepoint models, I need to be able to provide all frames as changepoints to the model. Any ideas as to why this might be happening?

I successfully built your code and produced results on the example data with 5000 points. While reading your code, however, I came across these lines that I do not understand...

In **internals/hsmm_messages.h**, function **messages_backwards_log**, when you are calculating the backward messages:

``` cpp
for(int i=0; i<M; i++) {
    if (ebetastarl(t,i) != ebetastarl(t,i)) {
        ebetastarl(i,t) = -1.0*numeric_limits<Type>::infinity();
    }
}
```

This piece of code appeared twice, once after you computed ebetal and another time after you computed ebetalstral. I assume you are trying to detect whether there exists NaN in your matrix, but why is it in the **if** statement, the indices are flipped? i.e.  **ebetastarl(t,i)** became **ebetastarl(i,t)** ? When t = 4999 and you only have 25 states, will **ebetastarl(i,t)** lead to an out-of-range exception? (at least on Eigen::Matrix it will have an assertion error?)

Thanks!

I'm trying to run <python hmm.py> from the examples directory, and it's giving me an import error. Here is the last part of the message:

It sounds like cstats hasn't built correctly. I've downloaded your pybasicbayes distribution into the site-packages directory, and when I tried running the <python setup.py> in the pybasicbayes\util directory, I got the following message:

What is vcvarsall.bat, and where might it be? (and how can I get cstats/cython to find it?)

Thanks for your help,

Would it make sense to have some sort of multi-chain class that could wrap multiple models (potentially running in parallel) and check convergence of the parameter estimates? I think it may be useful to be able to code something like

``` python
model.resample_model(chains = 4, check_convergence = 100)
model.summary_parameters()
```

to run 4 chain and check convergence every 100 iterations and then summarize the parameters estimates with the samples from all chains.

Do you have some sort of code that does this, even if rudimentary? I can try to wrap it up.

I was wondering what would be a effective way of including prior information for a change-point/segmentation using the Sticky-HMM. In particular I have a set of sequences of which there is a previously generated high quality segmentation. I would like to use that information in order to speed up and help segmenting new data. 
What I did think it may be possible it was:
- to start a model with these pre-segmented data
- update the distribution parameters without up-dating the state sequences
- load the new data and update all parameters of the model but only the state sequences of the new data, i.e., keeping the state sequences of the all data constant. 

Does this sounds like something good? or perhaps it would be better to remove the pre-segmented data prior to loading and analyzing the new data. I imagine if I keep the pre-segmented data in the model will be pull towards that answer (to some extent) but if I remove it then i would be only having  smart start for the distribution and transition parameters. 

What do you think?

I have created a resample_model_parallel2 function which resamples the observation distributions in parrallel. This was at the cost of pushing the model into the engines an additional time. However, on my test this had very minor overload. I have added code to parallel.py .. that was easy!!! given the code you had in there already.

In my initial test with Nmax = 100 the execution time came down to half :)

i did not see a way to parallelise the sampling of the trans_dist but let me know if you think it is possible  I can work on it. resampling of the initial state is super quick anyways so no  point in speeding that up. 

Thanks a lot!

After your great help on issue #5 it is fast enough for me to test it on my application. i wonder if you have any suggestion on how to test for convergence. Would you test for convergence of the parameters (all or some important ones)? Could one use the convergence of the state assignment to different data points? 

Any suggestion is welcome. I know one would normally go in line with the first of above but if there is a alternative to check convergence of 10s of parameters I would be happy.

A quick question on the parallelism implemented for you code. i am not seen much speed up on some test data so I am wondering if I am understanding how to exploit properly your parallel implementation. 

i am starting the ipcluster with

2013-04-02 14:05:26.478 [IPClusterStart] Engines appear to have started successfully

Is the parallelism being applied to each data loaded to the model? i.e., each data loaded with model.add_data_parallel() is being run on a different ipython engine.

Or is the actual state sampling calculation being spread across the engines? 

thanks in advance,

I realised you added the code to sample in parallel for the stickyHMM, great! I think the function for add_data_parallel may be missing from the HMM class on pyhsmm/models.py though.

Could you give me on how to use your code to identify change point on a one dimensional sequence of poisson counts. the counts are large (e.g, > 100) (and show overdispersion) and I would like to identify change points without specifying the number of different states the segments can adopt. If possible I would like to try the HDP-HMM and the HDP-HSMM and compare the results. 

I have looked at your change point example and I found the line ""TODO estimate the changepoints instead"", so I decided to write to get some advice on how to use your code.
Attached is a example of how the actual data looks like. deviation from the central line of points are potential segments on which we want to identify the change points.

Look forward to your comments.

This is currently handcrafted by basically removing the UMD wrapper and adding the exports at the bottom of the file. This file is then references from `package.json` using the `module` field.

I hope this can be published soon as it would allow `he` to be used by packages that are esm based and and bundlers that have difficulties to detect the exported names.

Currently, the _iife_ wrapper in the source contains `this` and it throws errors in Rollup:

I'm using this library in production and get reports of JavaScript errors (in TrackJS.com) from IE & Edge browsers like: 

* Expected identifier, string or number
* Unterminated string constant
* Expected ':', '}' or ';'
* illegal character

And when I check the error file / line, it's sometimes in he.js, like here :

And sometimes it's in other parts of the code (like in YUI library)... seems completely random, by the way : 

![fireshot capture 10 - track_js error_ expected _ - https___my trackjs com_details_09c](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/310134/24353434/cd9d8422-12ed-11e7-9061-20c2198f5ede.png)

The only idea I have would be that IE shits on himself when loading the very long JSON defined in he.js. Or maybe the fact that there's very long strings processed in regex ?

Here's the exact version of he.js I'm using in my project : [he.js.zip](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/he/files/872208/he.js.zip)
I've modified it a bit, trying to cut the very long lines into shorter lines. Which didn't fixed it.

Have you ever had any issue of this kind ?

Surprisingly, I found that `he.decode()` was 2x slower for my string than using the browser's textarea. Here is the code I used to run my benchmarks. The `<script>` src at the top should be changed to point to your `he.js` script location:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang=""en"">
<head>
    <meta charset=""UTF-8"">
    <script src=""/he.js""></script>
    <title></title>
</head>
<body>
<script>
    var txtArea = document.createElement(""textarea"");
    function decodeHtmlSameTxtArea(html) {
        txtArea.innerHTML = html;
        return txtArea.value;
    }

    function decodeHtml(html) {
        var txt = document.createElement(""textarea"");
        txt.innerHTML = html;
        return txt.value;
    }

    var count = 100;
    var stringToDecode = ""hes a&#039;s a&#039;&#039;s a&#039;&#039;&#039;s a&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;s b&quot;s b&quot;&quot;s b&quot;&quot;&quot;s b&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;s \\ // &#039;&#039; ::&quot;&quot;&amp;*^ &lt; &gt; &lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;"";



    var a = performance.now();
    for (var i = 0; i < count; i++) {
        var decodedString = decodeHtml(stringToDecode);
    }
    var b = performance.now();
    console.info(""Time Taken (using new txtarea each time):"", (b - a)/1000, 'seconds.');



    var a = performance.now();
    for (var i = 0; i < count; i++) {
        var decodedString = decodeHtmlSameTxtArea(stringToDecode);
    }
    var b = performance.now();
    console.info(""Time Taken (using same txtarea):"", (b - a)/1000, 'seconds.');


    var a = performance.now();
    for (var i = 0; i < count; i++) {

    }
    var b = performance.now();
    console.info(""Time Taken (using HtmlEntities library function):"", (b - a)/1000, 'seconds.');

`\u2026` is being decoded correctly both from `hellip` and `mldr` named entities.
However, when encoding, `\u2026` is encoded into `mldr`.

This is the first automated pull requests to help reach the goal of up to date and stable software.
It updates all of the dependencies in the `package.json` at one go, but from now on you’ll receive **pull requests** for each dependency update **in isolation and in real time**.

For updates that satisfy the existing version range you’ll get pull-requests only if it breaks your build.

Example:

``` diff
-  ""underscore"": ""^1.6.0""
+  ""underscore"": ""^1.7.0""
```

When an update does not satisfy the existing range you’ll get the pull request right away.

Example:

``` diff
-  ""lodash"": ""^3.0.0""
+  ""lodash"": ""^4.0.0""
```

Happy fixing and merging :palm_tree:

Thanks for the great library! I had the need to encode HTML entities to the decimal format instead of hexadecimal format. Please review the changes. Are additional test cases necessary? As I am not an expert in HTML entities, I can not really judge about corner cases that must be tested.

Current behavior:

``` js
> he.encode('\x80')
'&#x80;'
```

`&#x80;` is an invalid character reference (parse error) but then again, using the raw U+0080 character [is just as invalid](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/parsing.html#preprocessing-the-input-stream). The difference is that U+0080 in HTML source gets ignored, while `&#x80;` becomes `€` due to the overrides table.

Should we continue to return invalid entities, knowing they might map to a completely different symbol? Or should we not escape any invalid code points in the input? Or should we strip invalid characters from the input?
Should there be a `strict` option for `encode` as well (just like there is for `decode`) which errors in case an invalid character is part of the source?

Previously, the answer just included the first code snippet. I recently edited the answer to note the rationale behind using a `textarea` instead of a `div`. However, I'm a little uneasy, because I know that your library exists and is not (as far as I can tell) strictly targeting node users. I find myself wondering why.

I'll probably post a link to this library as an answer (unless you'd like to do so yourself) to that question regardless, since I figure that people who are using node may benefit from having a single solution that is usable both clientside and serverside. But how about everyone else? What reason is there for anyone to serve a 300 line script to serve a purpose that can - it seems to my naive eyes - be done in 50 characters with a clever hack?

Are there any situations at all in which the `textarea` hack fails (or at least is not guaranteed by spec to succeed)? I confess to being slightly uneasy about it since I don't know where (or for that matter, if) the spec determines the behaviour of browsers when presented with HTML elements containing disallowed children, like

``` html
<textarea>
    <p>I'm not really supposed to be here.</p>
</textarea>
```

but from the testing I've done, it seems to work.

Sorry to offload a question like this onto you, but it seems to be right in your area of expertise and is relevant when figuring out to whom this library is useful. (Indeed, if there _is_ something profoundly wrong with the `textarea` hack, it almost seems worth noting that in this library's README - otherwise, the case for using a library for this purpose at all is unclear).

The trick to managing these dotfiles is by creating a [bare](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/setting-up-a-repository/git-init) git repository.

**The reason for this Issue is to make people aware about way and this repository is the best place for it, cause lets face it every developer trying to customize there os has or will peek into this repo atleast once.**

## Managing and tracking [dot]files with bare repo 

### I'm copy pasting it from [https://github.com/kalkayan/dotfiles](https://github.com/kalkayan/dotfiles)

Clone the repo as a bare repository and thats it! no problems related to symlinks. 
```bash
# after forking replace the <username> with your github handle
git clone --bare https://github.com/<username>/dotfiles.git $HOME/.dotfiles
````

> Notice the `--bare` flag, this the clones repository as a bare repository. Bare repository are special in a way that they omit working directory, therefore to use a bare repository, first we need to define the following.
> - `--work-tree` - this can be your home directory, i.e., `$HOME` or `~`)
> - `--git-dir` - where the repository is cloned - `$HOME/.dotfiles`
>
> Therefore the command to use the repository will have a prefix `git --git-dir=$HOME/.dotfiles --work-tree=$HOME `, 

Now next step is to checkout to the proper branch according to the os of the machine.
```bash
# checkout to main for macos and linux for ubuntu.
git --git-dir=$HOME/.dotfiles --work-tree=$HOME checkout main
```


### Usage of dotfiles

This method of managing and sharing has various advantages some of them are shown below:

**1. Keep the dofitles versioned, (basically all the cons of using git)**
At this point, all your configuration files are being tracked, and you can easily use the `dotfiles` command ([see this line in .aliases](https://github.com/kalkayan/dotfiles/blob/main/.aliases#L69)) to manage the repository, some examples are:-
```bash
# to check the version history 
dotfiles log

# to check the status of the tracked and untracked files 
dotfiles status

# to add a file for tracking
dotfiles commit .vimrc -m "".vimrc added""

# push new files or changes to the github
dotfiles push origin main
```

> :warning: The `dotfiles status` will show all the untracked files to disable this behavior, do the following
>
> ```bash 
> # to remove the untracked directories and files from the listing
> dotfiles config --local status.showUntrackedFiles no 
> ```

**2. Share on Multiple devices**
Share the same configs of multiple devices with minimal changes using `branch`, create a branch for your new machine, example:-

```bash
# Create configurations specific to your aws machines
dotfiles checkout -b aws
```

**3. Create Profiles for dotfiles**
Create configs based on your environment using `branch`, create a branch and configure according to you work env.
```bash
# Manage multiple profiles - check out to the work profile 
dotfiles checkout work
```

One suggestion:

replace
```
# Hide Spotlight tray-icon (and subsequent helper)
#sudo chmod 600 /System/Library/CoreServices/Search.bundle/Contents/MacOS/Search
```
with
```
# Hide Spotlight tray-icon and disable ⌘-space keyboard shortcut. 
#sudo chmod 600 /System/Library/CoreServices/Search.bundle/Contents/MacOS/Search
```
because
- this more accurately describes the total effect
- spotlight itself still available by other means, it is not disabled rather less convenient

**how to get spotlight back**

And in case anyone ever comes looking for it, [here is a method](https://www.techradar.com/how-to/computing/apple/terminal-101-remove-spotlight-from-os-x-menubar-1305615) to reverse it

Got a mix between paulirish and mathiasbynens, getting what I want from them.

I use [Itsycal](https://www.mowglii.com/itsycal/) and want to hide the Clock from menu bar, it worked before just unchecking _Show date and time in menu bar_ at **System Preference > Date & Time > Clock**. 
Then after I first ran my .osx file that have the commands to hide Menu Bar icons, the Clock and Spotlight icons keep coming back, even if I go to **System Preferences** and uncheck the option, every time I reboot my Mac, both of them are there again.

Commands on my .osx file:

	
	sudo chmod 700 ~/Library/Preferences
	sudo chown ""${UID}"" ~/Library/Preferences

A while ago I [patched the Monaco](https://github.com/Alhadis/Menloco) font to use [Menlo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menlo_%28typeface%29)'s box-drawing glyphs, which ***vastly*** improves the appearance of grids and tables in the terminal:

Since it's a commercially-licensed typeface, I couldn't upload the modified version without infringing on copyright. So I wrote a FontForge script that actually automates the modifications I made to Monaco... just to have prettier-looking borders. =)

However, brew does NOT install bash-completion there.  Instead, the correct location is ```$(brew --prefix)/etc/bash_completion```

**Steps to reproduce:**
1. Install macOS 10.12 (latest)
1. Install brewh.sh: ```/usr/bin/ruby -e ""$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)""```

1. No completion options shown for `dd` command, which should include things like ```if=``` or ```of=```

1. Completion options should be shown

- Changing NSGlobalDomain to -g makes it less prone to problems if Apple changes things

- Reordering is just more logical (categorical, then alphabetical)

I often wondered why doing `defaults read com.apple.finder > default.txt`, add some sidebar items, `defaults read com.apple.finder > custom.txt` then `diff default.txt custom.txt` didn't show anything.
Googling ‘finder sidebar defaults write’ might have given me [some clues](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6430038?start=0&tstart=0). As it appears, Finder's sidebar user defaults (`com.apple.sidebarlists`) are different than Finder's user defaults (`com.apple.finder`).
Also, I'll write this as some sort of tutorial, in case some people would like to join us in a world of undocumented boring reverse-engineering.

#### Step 1

Let's start by deleting Finder & Finder's sidebar user defaults.

``` shell
defaults delete com.apple.finder; defaults delete com.apple.sidebarlists; killall Finder
```

Let's then remake Finder's sidebar user defaults, tinker around with Finder's sidebar preferences via GUI then [save those [for later comparison]](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/files/404954/default.txt).

``` shell
open -a Finder.app .
```

> [⌘] + [,], ‘Sidebar’ + [Right click] & ‘{ User }’ + [Right click] \* 2

``` shell
killall Finder; defaults read com.apple. > default.txt
```

#### Step 2

Let's now invert Finder's sidebar preferences via GUI so that what was enabled becomes disabled and what was disabled becomes enabled [just clicking each item once].

> ```
> open -a Finder.app .
> ```
> 
> et cætera,
> 
> ```
> killall Finder
> ```

… And then [save those for later comparison](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/files/404952/custom.txt).

```
defaults read com.apple.sidebarlists > custom.txt
```

#### Step 3

Let's eventually [compare both user defaults](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/files/404953/diff.txt).

_`diff.txt` sample_

As it can be observed, those are what I was first looking for, though `diff`'s output is just a teeny-tiny part of the hole string.
Looking at `custom.txt`'s first lines tells me that this might be kind of similar to setting Dock's arrays items.

```
{
    favoriteitems =     {
        Controller = CustomListItems;
        CustomListItems =         (
                        {
...
```

_`custom.txt` sample_

What I wonder now is how to use `defaults write` to set those with a shell script. I'll tinker a bit more with this and try to come up with a solution. The problem is: what do those hex values mean? Taking a wild guess, I'd say it might be the path the sidebar item links to and maybe the position in the list (though it may be determined by the order it appears in the user defaults). There are other properties I don't get the point of. This looks like a crossover between Finder aliases and Dock items.

**PS:** This is just the beginning. When I'll have figured out how to do this, I will try to add non native items to Finder's sidebar (such as second-party personal directories).

I just want to use the `.osx` file. I didn't follow any of the instructions in the README, because they don't seem relevant to using `.osx`.

I created a `.osx` file in my home folder: `~/.osx`. I copy-pasted the `.osx` file in this repo into that file I created. Then I commented/uncommented things account according to my preferences. Then I tried running `./.osx`, and it isn't working:

I checked your dotfiles and they are pretty good!

Perhaps, you might be interested to use a mechanism that allows to easily share, control and sync your dotfiles via a recent package manger I have built https://github.com/pearl-core/pearl

There is an existing official repository of dotfiles that can be, but you can create your own repository to allow people to try your dotfiles easily.

There are still few improvements that need to be done but the major features have been already implemented.

I would appreciate if you can give it a try.

Thank you,
Filippo

Mathias, at your call I've created this pull request. (See discussion in _issue_ [GREP_OPTIONS is deprecated #467 ](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/issues/467.""GREP_OPTIONS""))

Change GREP_OPTIONS=--color=auto in .exports to aliases to avoid errors.

File:       .exports, .aliases

The GREP_OPTIONS environment variable is deprecated in GNU grep 2.21.
(But not so in OS X grep 2.5.1-FreeBSD.)

To avoid errors such as this:

```
$ env | grep -i grep
grep: warning: GREP_OPTIONS is deprecated; please use an alias or script
GREP_OPTIONS=--color=auto

$ grep --version
grep (GNU grep) 2.21
```

grep color support was moved from .exports to .aliases as follows:

Remove from .exports:

```
# Always enable colored grep output
export GREP_OPTIONS=""--color=auto""
```

Add to .aliases:

```
# Move export GREP_OPTIONS=""--color=auto"" (which is deprecated in GNU grep)
# from .exports to .aliases
# Always enable colored grep output
alias grep=""grep --color=auto""
alias fgrep=""fgrep --color=auto""
alias egrep=""egrep --color=auto""
```

I created the .aliases.sh in my home dir and it is the same dir as .bash_profile. in .bash_profile I placed the source dir like you said. and have your command for myip in aliases. which i dont know why I copied and pasted a new folder never happens. What i wanted to do as I am trying to learn swift and every now and then it gets a bit buggy is clean it out. so I planned to a couple of lines down place this code. with a trigger of cc. one of my problems is when i open up terminal it immediately executes the source folder. 

so i deleted the stuff I was trying to add and went for something simpler. 

I copied and pasted your #Hosts and trigger for that. here is what that looks like

-bash: alias: nano: not found
-bash: alias: /private/etc/hosts”: not found
Speedy:~ Speedy$ hosts
-bash: “sudo: command not found

basically it executes when i open terminal. Here is a screen shot of first thing when I open terminal.

One thing I like to do is setup Sublime Text by adding a few files that include preferences, key bindings and snippets. The way I've previously done this is by having the files in the dotfiles repo then copying them as part of the `.osx` file run, e.g.:

```
cp init/console_log.sublime-snippet ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 3/Packages/User/
```

But when I ran my `.osx` file I didn't have Sublime Text installed and thus the path didn't exist and I got an error. I'm thinking a better way would be to use `curl` and link to a gist instead.

```
curl -o ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 3/Packages/User/Emmet.sublime-settings https://gist.githubusercontent.com/s10wen/b2c839e725965ad11c1f/raw/ff6153621974787430f9b58bd2e965e16e2ddb7d/gistfile1.txt

Thanks for sharing your great dotfiles. I'm using it as a great inspiration source. In fact, I've taken your .bash_prompt settings for my Mac OS X Yosemite machine. I noticed that the command line gets overwritten when I type long command lines. Is this something that's related to my setup only or do you experience this as well?

I'm trying to find a solution for this (i.e. wrapping it to the new line). I noticed it seems to be relative to the Terminal window (I'm using iTerm2). Any ideas?

I wanted to submit the function I've been using for a long while for your consideration. It's called `up` and it basically does what these aliases do, but as a function that takes an arbitrary integer argument, moving up in the directory tree that many times. If no argument is passed, it acts as an alias for `cd ..`.

``` bash
up    # cd ..

This collection of dotfiles is rad, and I totally depend on them for my system config. Would be happy to help contribute, if only a small amount.

Running `sudo nvram -p` afterwards shows that the value has gone back to the default `L`, so it would seem as if Yosemite resets the value to its default on reboot and before the chime, so the change is never made effective.

I decided to add my settings to my `.osx` as well. Here’s the script I hacked together to extract the current Spectacle.app defaults:

``` bash
for key in MakeLarger MakeSmaller MoveToBottomDisplay MoveToBottomHalf MoveToCenter MoveToFullscreen MoveToLeftDisplay MoveToLeftHalf MoveToLowerLeft MoveToLowerRight MoveToNextDisplay MoveToNextThird MoveToPreviousDisplay MoveToPreviousThird MoveToRightDisplay MoveToRightHalf MoveToTopDisplay MoveToTopHalf MoveToUpperLeft MoveToUpperRight RedoLastMove UndoLastMove; do
  printf ""defaults write com.divisiblebyzero.Spectacle ${key} -data "";
  defaults read com.divisiblebyzero.Spectacle ${key} | sed 's/[^0-9a-f]//g';
done
```

This outputs something like:

``` bash
defaults write com.divisiblebyzero.Spectacle MakeLarger -data 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

# Return an IP address in reverse form. Works with IPv6, too. Actually this is a helper function for asn().
$ revip 1.2.3.4
4.3.2.1
$ revip 2a00:1450:4016:803::1008

The alias `myasn` echoes the ASN info for the current `ip`.

Maybe this is of interest for anyone :)

I want to know if people think that this can be helpful or it only adds more complexity and innecessary lines of code to dotfiles. So far I've discovered this:
- Launch service handlers info is stored in `~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.LaunchServices/com.apple.launchservices.secure.plist`
- The entry is called `LSHandlers` and is an array that contents dicts, each dict contais the specific content type and the default app to handle it
- Changes only be applied after restarting the Mac
- You can change your default web browser using `LSHandlers`

After investigate about LSHandlers, I've created three methods to change how apps manage each filetype, here's what I've created so far:

**1. Create a function that iterates through each array item in LSHandler**
-  **Pros**
  - It adds or change only one entry without affect the rest
  - You can search and modify only the filetype you want
  - Due the previous facts this method is more secure because it doesn't affect previous settings
- **Cons**
  - More complex than the other one method
  - It requires more lines of code
  - It requires a function

Code:

```
function set_lshandlers() {
    # $1 = content type field
    # $2 = content type value
    # $3 = launch service handler field
    # $4 = launch service handler value

    local plistfile=""$HOME/Library/Preferences/com.apple.LaunchServices/com.apple.launchservices.secure.plist""
    local array_item=0

    while [ ""$array_item"" != ""false"" ]; do
        if [ ""$(/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c ""Print :LSHandlers:$array_item"" $plistfile 2>/dev/null)"" ]; then
            if [ ""$(/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c ""Print :LSHandlers:$array_item:$1"" $plistfile 2>/dev/null)"" = ""$2"" ]; then
                /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c ""Set :LSHandlers:$array_item:$3 $4"" $plistfile
                array_item=false
            fi  
        else
            array_item=false
        fi

        if [ ""$array_item"" != ""false"" ]; then
            ((array_item+=1))
        fi
    done
}

# Example: set Sublime Text 3 as default app to open Markdown files
set_lshandlers LSHandlerContentType net.daringfireball.markdown LSHandlerRoleAll com.sublimetext.3
```

**2. Use `defaults -add-array` to add items to an array of dicts**
- **Pros**
  - It reduces complexity
  - It uses `defaults` command which is better known that `PListtBuddy`
- **Cons**
  - It create duplicated items that are handled and removed automatically by the system after restart
  - Due the previous fact this method is lazy, I've tested with some apps in Yosemite and it and works well

Code:

```
# This add only one entry without removing previous entries, the after restart
# the system automatically removes previous entry with the same filetype value stored
defaults write ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.LaunchServices/com.apple.launchservices.secure.plist LSHandlers -array-add \
'{""LSHandlerContentType"" = ""net.daringfireball.markdown""; ""LSHandlerPreferredVersions"" = { ""LSHandlerRoleAll"" = ""-""; }; LSHandlerRoleAll = ""com.sublimetext.3"";}'
```

**2. Use `defaults -array` to create a new array of dicts and remove previous**
- **Pros**
  - It reduces complexity
  - It uses `defaults` command which is better known that `PListtBuddy`
  - This let you set only the `LSHandlers` you want to use removing previous
- **Cons**
  - This **removes all previous `LSHandlers`**  and it can create unexpected behaviours, this can be dangerous
  - You should track all the `LSHandlers`of your system each time you run `.osx` file to avoid errors

Code:

```
# This removes all previous entries and add only one for markdown files
defaults write ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.LaunchServices/com.apple.launchservices.secure.plist LSHandlers -array-add \
'{""LSHandlerContentType"" = ""net.daringfireball.markdown""; ""LSHandlerPreferredVersions"" = { ""LSHandlerRoleAll"" = ""-""; }; LSHandlerRoleAll = ""com.sublimetext.3"";}'

Load the shell dotfiles, and then some:

  for file in ~/.{path,exports,aliases,functions,extra,osx}; do

  unset file;

everything works fine. But the .osx file takes really long to load ever time i open a new terminal tab. Am I doing something wrong? Is this the purpose of .osx? I mean, I know that I can owerwrite settings or comment them out.

I cloned your repo, ran the bootstrap.sh script. Now what i dont understand is:
why can't I use the aliases for example? I thought that your dotfiles would automatically get included after i started your bootstrap script. But whenever i : source ./.aliases, it works while i leave the terminal app opened. as soon as i close it, it wont get loaded in my terminal session again.
so how would i acomplish it, so that all your dotfiles get loaded automatically?

# Enhanced WHOIS lookups
alias whois=""whois -h whois-servers.net""

According to the `man` page a variant of `whois-servers.net` is used by default, so not only is it apparently broken, it's also unnecessary.

```
-h host
    Use the specified host instead of the default variant.  Either a host name or an IP address may be specified.

    By default whois constructs the name of a whois server to use from the top-level domain (TLD) of the supplied (single) argument, and appending "".whois-servers.net"".  This effectively allows a suitable whois server to be selected automatically for a large number of TLDs.

    In the event that an IP address is specified, the whois server will default to the American Registry for Internet Numbers (ARIN).  If a query to ARIN references APNIC, LACNIC, or RIPE, that server will be queried also, provided that the -Q option is not specified.

    If the query is not a domain name or IP address, whois will fall back to whois.crsnic.net.
```

There are other whois proxies, [`whois.geektools.com`](http://www.geektools.com/faq.html) for example, but I'll leave that up to your discretion.

I think that I saw an issue/comment about this shortcut not working in Mavericks (but I can't find it in this repo strangely) so apologies in advance for creating a dupe... 

Originally I tried commenting out the override in .osx 4267ea9582e3bac8ad70cae1048eedbbe367090e but that didn't work so I tried setting it with the unicode values for Cmd+Shift+D but I must be doing it wrong as this doesn't work either.

```

It'd be nice to have the keyboard shortcut to Send in Mail back... Any help would be great - thanks.

Check out the [`grc` mirror repository on GitHub](https://github.com/pengwynn/grc).

I've done the following changes:
- Install `grc` via `brew`
- Copy `$(brew --prefix grc)/etc/grc.bashrc` to `~/.grc.bashrc`.
  `grc` colourize the `diff` command output by default. I've removed that
  since there already is a `diff()` function in `.functions` which uses `git`.
- Source the `grc.bashrc` file in `.bash_profile`.

Here is an example with colourless `ping` command:

I'm trying to use your dotfiles - however I'm experiencing an issue with `homebrew`. Not sure if you know how to fix it....

I get the following error/warning when running `brew doctor`

Consider setting your PATH so that /usr/local/bin
occurs before /usr/bin. Here is a one-liner:
    echo export PATH='/usr/local/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bash_profile
```

If I do add that to the `~/.path` that you provide (or the `~/.extra`) it basically makes my shell blow up and go unusable.

Any thoughts?

The problem with `IdentityFile` is that it just adds the key to the list of keys to send to _each_ host — there’s no way to say “if and only if this is host X, send this key”. (To check which keys `ssh` is offering to the host, use the `-v` option.)

The `IdentitiesOnly yes` setting helps, but causes issues when `ssh`ing into a box for which there is no entry in `~/.ssh/config` yet, e.g. `ssh foo@example.com`:

> Received disconnect from $IP: Too many authentication failures for $user

What I’d like is for `ssh someknownhost` to connect to `someknownhost` using the key (`IdentityFile`) I specified for that host in `~/.ssh/config`.

On the other hand, `ssh foo@example.com` (i.e. `ssh` followed by a host that is not listed in `~/.ssh/config`) should not send any of my keys, as if the `-o PubkeyAuthentication=no` option was used.

So, I’d like to override `ssh` with a function that automatically adds `-o PubkeyAuthentication=no` to the command unless there is a _known host_ in the argument list. Known hosts are defined as `hosts=""$(grep ""^Host"" ~/.ssh/config | grep -v ""[?*]"" | cut -d "" "" -f2 | tr ' ' '\n')""`.

Any volunteers? :)

---

FWIW, @janmoesen did something similar here: https://gist.github.com/janmoesen/7114384 This solution requires hardcoding the host/key mappings, though. Adding `-o PubkeyAuthentication=no` when needed seems simpler.

First off, standard enthusiastic thanks for your work maintaining this repository. I come back to .osx constantly when I have a new machine or OS to set up, and I'm slowly exploring the others. Terrific stuff.

I have one tiny contribution to make to the whole enterprise: I thought it might be worth noting on [lines 88--90 of `.osx`](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/blob/bd9429af1cfdc7f4caa73e6f98773ed69a161c9c/.osx#L88-L91) that the `~/.CFUserTextEncoding` thing also breaks Adobe Creative Cloud apps---like all of them, the whole kit and caboodle, even things versioned way after CS5. Based on some aggressive Googling and forum-trawling, I think it's just me and one or two other UTF-loving folks who've experienced the lethal configuration combination, but when it happens, there's nothing in the crash logs or the diagnostics or in heaven or in hell to indicate why no Creative Cloud app, not even the installers, will load. I happened to stumble across a since-lost post where someone figured it out, and as soon as I deleted my `~/.CFUserTextEncoding` file and rebooted I was able to run everything just fine.

Thanks again for a great resource!

@alrra suggested using fewer Zopfli iterations (`15` is the default) but I’m not sure about that, as it would minimize the benefit of using Zopfli.

@einars suggested using [pigz](http://zlib.net/pigz/) (`brew install pigz`), the fast gzip-compatible multithreaded compressor™. Perhaps another check before falling back to `gzip`?

```
git clone https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles.git && cd dotfiles && source bootstrap.sh
```

Cloning the repo without setting a umask actually creates a `dotfiles` directory whose permissions reflect the current umask, in most cases leading to a world-readable directory:

```
[jonas@catbert tmp]$ git clone https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles.git
Cloning into 'dotfiles'...
[...]

[jonas@catbert tmp]$ ls -ld dotfiles
drwxrwxr-x 6 jonas jonas 4096 Dec  5 12:36 dotfiles
```

No problem until here. But then `bootstrap.sh` does the following:

```
rsync [...] -av . ~
```

... which does not sync the directory's _content_ but the directory _itself_, including its permissions. After that, if `dotfiles` has been publically readable, `$HOME` is too, which really is unacceptable on a multi-user system.

Any Linux distro that I personally know (quite a couple) uses 002 or 022 as the default umask while `useradd` creates the home directory of a user with 007 or 077 as configured in `/etc/login.defs`, so on most systems the default installation process will lead to a privacy incident.

Please advise users that want to install your dotfiles to set an adequate umask before. Getting the permissions of their home directory incidently changed (without notice!) is quite surprising, and in many cases, dangerous.

As soon as the “poof” animation appears, you can release the mouse button to remove the icon.

![](http://i.stack.imgur.com/0goJy.jpg)

It seems like in Mountain Lion there is a bit of a delay plus a minimum distance required between when you start dragging and when the “poof” animation appears, i.e. when you can release the mouse button to remove the icon. If you release the mouse button before the “poof” animation appears, the icon won’t be deleted from the Dock. If you don’t drag the icon far enough away from the Dock, the “poof” animation won’t appear at all, and again the icon won’t be deleted from the Dock when you release the mouse button.

Is there a hidden setting (`defaults write`-style) or some other way to disable this delay and/or minimum distance setting?

Based on this output, I’d expect the following to work:

``` bash
defaults write com.apple.spotlight orderedItems -array ""{ enabled = 1; name = APPLICATIONS; }"" ""{ enabled = 1; name = \""SYSTEM_PREFS\""; }"" ""{ enabled = 1; name = DIRECTORIES; }"" ""{ enabled = 1; name = PDF; }"" ""{ enabled = 1; name = FONTS; }"" ""{ enabled = 0; name = DOCUMENTS; }"" ""{ enabled = 0; name = MESSAGES; }"" ""{ enabled = 0; name = CONTACT; }"" ""{ enabled = 0; name = \""EVENT_TODO\""; }"" ""{ enabled = 0; name = IMAGES; }"" ""{ enabled = 0; name = BOOKMARKS; }"" ""{ enabled = 0; name = MUSIC; }"" ""{ enabled = 0; name = MOVIES; }"" ""{ enabled = 0; name = PRESENTATIONS; }"" ""{ enabled = 0; name = SPREADSHEETS; }"" ""{ enabled = 0; name = SOURCE; }""
