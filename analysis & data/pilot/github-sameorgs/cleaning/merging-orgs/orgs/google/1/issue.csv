Perhaps this is something that would require a special case, to make sure **stems without note heads** have identical heights whether they are going up or down.

On my simple tests with EasyScore, I notice that my quarter notes with the stem going up look different from my quarter notes with the stem going down.

I assumed they should be just 180 degree rotations of one another, but the quarter note with the stem going up has a sharp edge where the stem meets the note head. 

When you zoom in on the web page, you see that the stem pokes out a little beyond the edge of the note head. It's not a smooth transition.

I traced it to the bravura_metrics.ts file, and when I add an extra line:

```
      noteheadBlack: {
        offsetYBaseStemUp: -2,    // <--- I added this line
        offsetYBaseStemDown: 2,
      },

```

Then the notes look great and symmetrical. They also match how it looks when I use the Bravura font in Affinity Designer and insert a quarter note with stem going upward.

So should we add this line? Or does it break other things? I am new to VexFlow so I am not sure if adding this line will break your visual regression tests.

I am getting this on _all_ javascript files also, not just the .ts.  So maybe there is some configuration change?  In other words, I see the webpack output for all javascript under /src, not just the .ts files.  Files under /tests still look like javascript (from the source map).

I am cheering you guys on in your typescript conversion!  And I'm sorry for bringing up a question that does not directly relate to Vex.  I am apparently one of the few web developers who has never used Angular and so I am just learning ts.

When I open music.ts, I see the output of webpack.  I know I've seen other screenshots of people with TS highlighting, public/interface and all that.  How do we get that?   Do we need to install Visual Studio Code?  That is where all the TS question about angular lead.  Is there some Chrome add-on?

If I can figure it out, I will add it to the wiki so other TS newbs won't have to ask the same question.

Edit: I should mention that I am generating the debug build so I have a source map.  The .ts shows up in the sidebar but I see the transpiled .js.

Not the formatter (1/6th) or the draw routines (also about 1/3) which I expected.  (the rest is my application stuff).

Is this expected?   The majority of the time is spent in different 'reset' functions and buildNoteHeads.  Also I may be reading the Chrome call diagram wrong.  But this diagram seems consistent with what I observe when profiling the parts of my application that create the notes vs. the parts that render the things.

EDIT:  I realize part of the issue is that I'm setting the stem direction on the constructor, and also calling setStemDirection which just does the same thing.  Once that is fixed, the time spent is less but still significant.  It's not clear why autoStem and reset take so long.  Updated diagram to show this.

The fiddles show the issue.  It seems the single call is the one that is not behaving correctly, but I'm not sure what the intent was.  
Once difference I see in the code is that, with 2 calls, each tickable at the same location is added to a different modifierContext.  I'm not sure if that is causing the issue, though.

The suggested ways of just hacking around the DOM inside React's lifecycle hooks actually has no real benefits other than syntactic sugar with some (very) naive automagic rendering.

Since the entire DOM management is delegated to VexFlow, we're kinda missing out on its performance benefits (i.e getting all of this into the virtual DOM).

I'm new to this library, but I think that the right approach should be to create a 'React render context' of sorts and manage the data model via state calls.

Since context is currently hard coded, I was also wondering if we can inject external contexts and register it within the renderer itself.

It seems like a small PR looking at the current implementation : https://github.com/0xfe/vexflow/blob/656be044ae21053c32b2704b6c6fc7e26633f2fa/src/renderer.js#L136

Taking this:

```js
   if (this.backend === Renderer.Backends.CANVAS) {
      // Create context.
      if (!this.element.getContext) {
        throw new Vex.RERR('BadElement', `Can't get canvas context from element: ${elementId}`);
      }
      this.ctx = Renderer.bolsterCanvasContext(this.element.getContext('2d'));
    } else if (this.backend === Renderer.Backends.RAPHAEL) {
      this.ctx = new RaphaelContext(this.element);
    } else if (this.backend === Renderer.Backends.SVG) {
      this.ctx = new SVGContext(this.element);
    } else {
      throw new Vex.RERR('InvalidBackend', `No support for backend: ${this.backend}`);

```js
const backend = Renderer.Backends[this.backend];
if(backend) {
  this.ctx = backend.createContext(this.element); // implemented individually within each context
} else {
  throw new Vex.RERR('InvalidBackend', `No support for backend: ${this.backend}`);
}
```


This should come with something like `Renderer.Backends.register(context)` and will allow people to create independent plugins for various rendering scenarios.

If that's something you find interesting, I can submit a PR using D3 to show how this might work.

As for phase 2 for this, we can create a small 'Renderer Backend plugin boilerplate' repo with all the relevant test suits so that people will have confidence with their implementations and will be able to update their code for new features of either VexFlow or their engine of choice.

The application would register their preferred font metrics in the same way the default ones are registered, and include the font data any way they like (webfont, static, etc.).

Benefits might be:
* use font metrics in other text modules like annotations.  Currently these modules can't calculate the metrics pre-render and have to guess.
* automate basic calculations like width in pixels of a glyph.  If exact metrics are not available for a glyph, use a fallback glyph
* Vex applications can use non-English fonts
* vex applications can create font choosers with available fonts

Registering a font would be like:
``` javaascript
     TextFont.registerFont({
        name: 'RobotoSlabMetrics',
        resolution: RobotoSlabMetrics.resolution,
        glyphs: RobotoSlabMetrics.glyphs,
        fontFamily: RobotoSlabMetrics.fontFamily,
        serifs: true,
        monospaced: false,
        maxSizeGlyph: 'H',
        superscriptOffset: 0.66,
        subscriptOffset: 0.66,
        description: 'Default serif text font to pair with Bravura/Gonville engraving font',
      });
```
Fields like `serifs` and `descriptions` are informational and can be used by applications for font-list dialogs, or permit selecting a fallback font dynamically.

A font instance would be the font metrics combined with a particular font size (which could be changed dynamically).

``` javascript
const myFont = new TextFont({name: 'RobotoSlab', size: 12});
// ...
width += myFont.getWidthForGlyph('w');

It makes more obvious an existing bug in a current test.  The accent mark and the fermata on the last note of the first measure here appear to be on top of each other, but actually they are separated by 1/2 line space, similar to the staccato and accent on blessed g/5 in m. 1.  Solution will come in another PR: while the first articulation can appear in a half-line-space, all additional ones on the same side need a minimum of 1 line space (or need to take glyph-size into account).

This was the only test that explicitly called setLedgerLine style (on the second to last eighth note) -- its ledger line style is respected.  However the stave.lineWidth = 3 -- which is already almost ridiculously thick -- makes even more ridiculous ledger line widths.  Should we set a maximum width above which we do not double ledger line thickness?  Or do people get what they ask for?  I think it looks okay in context.

The actual width of a measure can vary greatly depending on some interaction that I don't understand, possibly between the proportions of the note values and the width of the annotations (I use annotations for lyrics).  

In the jsfiddle example, moving the 'z' from the 3rd word the 5th word causes the actual size of the measure to different by about 25%.  But increasing the measure width by about 2% fixes the issue.

In my application (smoosic) it is a real-time music editor, and it relies on estimates to determine system and page breaks.  The estimates don't have to be exact but I expect them to diverge gracefully.

If I don't specify the justify width, the overflow doesn't happen but the notes are all scrunched up.  I played around with softmaxFactor but it didn't help this issue very much.  I know what the justify width is supposed to be, but the bounds of the rendered notes end up being way wider than that, whereas before (pre-softmax changes) the notes always fit in the width I specified.

As you can see `opacity` is not respected, whereas the `background_color` is. I can almost make it to work selecting `white` as background color, but that's sloppy because the ledger lines cover other notes. Opacity is mentioned briefly in the [wiki](https://github.com/0xfe/vexflow/wiki/Animation-with-VexFlow-&-CSS) but that's in context of `NoteGroup`s. Is that the only way to make it work?

what I want does not seem possible, but perhaps it is (I am definitely not an expert in javascript and there may be some trick to force some of those variables to a ""wrong"" value so that I achieve all the `O`s at the same vertical level).

Alternatively, I could accomplish what I want in a different way, can you suggest options? I thought of:

* Another voice of `TextNote`s
* Another voice of `StaveNote`s with a constant high enough notes (made transparent) and with its own annotation
* Another voice of `StaveNote`s with a constant high enough notes without (or transparent) ledger lines and stems

When trying to instantiate a renderer, I need to use the enum `Vex.Flow.Renderer.Backends` however I can't because of the following error : 
`Cannot access ambient const enums when the '--isolatedModules' flag is provided`

_This problem also exists for the other enums as well, I am just using the renderer backend as an example as it is mandatory to use it for using vexflow with Typescript._

I am also pretty new to Typescript therefore I'm not sure if I understand everything about enums correctly yet. From my understanding, const enums are replaced at compile time by their value and cannot be used because the object usually created by the enum is not present at runtime. However, this object (and I think all enums from this file) should be available for developers using vexflow. 

**Suggested change**
I suggest to change all `const enum` to `enum` in vexflow type definitions to be able to use them in Typescript. I can work on a PR for this change if you think this is a correct change. If not, please explain to me why as it would greatly help me understand typescript enums better :)

Try it here:
https://jsfiddle.net/2Lsme8yd/
(setting the height back to 32767 fixes the problem)

This is because browsers limit the size of a canvas element:
https://stackoverflow.com/a/11585939/10295942

(It's funny that they just break without a real error message though.
And that a 16 bit signed integer seems to be the somewhat arbitrary limit. I guess you can fit width+height in one 32-bit register then.)

Btw, there's a npm module canvas-size that tells you the current browser's maximum canvas size, which could be used:
https://stackoverflow.com/a/53677532/10295942

So, @0xfe what do you think would be the best way to deal with this? OSMD logs a warning and simply reduces the height (and width) to the maximum of 32767.
I suppose Vexflow could do the same, outputting a warning with Vex.W(). Or exit with 1? ;)

You have        1 warning(s):

Now it outputs something like this:

I'm just starting to use this library, and it seems awesome. I'm a bit puzzled about the way staves layout is supposed to work, though.

First, I followed the EasyScore tutorial, but it took me a long time and quite some digging to realize a stave is only supposed to hold one measure. Adding more bars requires adding new staves. Is that correct? If that is, and since it's such an important feature, may I suggest to add this info in a more proeminent place in the tutorials?

I also have some problems understanding how the layout is supposed to work. As far as I can see, in every examples I could find, setting the layout is done manually, by setting absolute coordinates to successive staves.

Let's say I want to display some music on screen with different sizes (e.g a responsive web app). How should I approach it? Is there a built-in way to do it, because I could'nt find it?

Now if someone more competent than I am could just point me in the correct directions, I'd be happy to submit PR to maybe clarify the tutorials to help first-timers like myself.",NA,FALSE,https://api.github.com/repos/0xfe/vexflow,https://api.github.com/repos/0xfe/vexflow/issues/734/labels{/name},https://api.github.com/repos/0xfe/vexflow/issues/734/comments,https://api.github.com/repos/0xfe/vexflow/issues/734/events,https://github.com/0xfe/vexflow/issues/734,NA

I'm listening for changes in the dropdown, then calling `setClef()` or `setKeySignature()` on the staff, and then `context.clear();` and `stave.draw();`

If I set the keySignature again after setting the clef, it draws correctly, so this is an order of operations issue (but no API docs sooo... #530 ). I would expect the Staff to update the keySignature correctly when it's Clef changes.

As you can see in the `Path` row, `vexflow > npm`, this is caused by an old npm version that relies on a version of `https-proxy-agent` package whose version is older than 2.2.3.

This is caused by this line in package.json:

```
  ""dependencies"": {
    ""npm"": ""^6.5.0""
  }
```

Solutions:
1. Update npm in package.json like #653 did
2. Move npm to devDependencies
3.  ~~(**BEST**) Remove npm from package.json completely and never have to worry about something like this again. Anybody that has downloaded the vexflow project NEEDS to have npm installed anyway, because they wouldn't be able to download the devDependencies for vexflow.~~

Quite frankly, I'm baffled, because in order to determine the measure the mouse cursor is currently over I'm using it's bar lines positions (which are rendered as `<rect>` elements) and this creates an annoying problem to deal with.

Hope you are doing well, long time no see!

Recently while I introduced VexFlow to my friend, I found the current test can be broken in some cases.

SlimerJS does not provide support for the latest Firefox browser, so if someone already has installed Firefox on the machine, then `generate_svg_images.js` may fail due to the version conflict.

And nowadays there are many better alternative ways to generate images rather than using SlimerJS, so I applied.

I replaced SlimerJS & rsvg-convert to jsdom & node-canvas.
Now jsdom + node-canvas generates png images directly using `tools/generate_png_images.js`

I changed test script dependencies, so current travis-ci test will fail until you release new one.

Thanks,
Taehoon

When I use automatic beam with easyScore, I found something sort of tricky.
I had a measure with notes: `'c4/q, d4/8, e4/8, f4/q, g4/q'`, I got error `Beams can only be applied to notes shorter than a quarter note.`
Well it works when I just convert the sequence to `d4/8, e4/8, c4/q, f4/q, g4/q`.Not sure if this is by design.
Below is a minimal example.

After this, it's 0 vulnerabilities for Vexflow as a npm dependency in another project, and 4 low vulnerabilities, one moderate for Vexflow devDependencies. All tests still pass, seems like no breaking changes.

`npm audit` now runs automatically at the end of npm install with npm 6.x, and it doesn't look nice to have these warnings when using Vexflow as a dependency.

https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/audit

Jscs is unmaintained and merged with Eslint, so to eliminate the vulnerability one would have to fork the npm package or switch to Eslint.

I improved and reapplied the fix from #632. Now, GraceNoteGroups and NoteSubGroups use the same align function in modifier.js, whereas before they both had an align function that was duplicate code. I tried moving the alignment to a format method, because it should rather be there than in draw(), but when i tried it seemed like it was too early and didn't work.

In TickContext I added the possibility to represent x-positioning as base x plus offset, so we can simply overwrite the x-offset and not apply the x-offset of the previous draw()-call to the next one.

This could be a good method to use in general, though it'll still be possible to simply get and set x in TickContext.

We redraw a lot in OSMD compared to Vexflow tests, so we noticed [this issue](https://github.com/opensheetmusicdisplay/opensheetmusicdisplay/issues/300) pretty quickly.

The bug was introduced by [fixing quarter dotted rest dot positioning](https://github.com/0xfe/vexflow/commit/298cd8813e0a545c31fb312bd9f7dfa31e634e17) ([#607](https://github.com/0xfe/vexflow/issues/607)).

Rest note and stave note shiftY seem to be handled differently, stave notes apply the previous y-shift incrementally while for rest nodes you can add to the y-shift every draw without misplacement.
So the dot_shiftY maybe should be refactored to operate the same for stave notes and rests (= vs +=), but this fix handles the difference for now.
All visual regression tests pass and i haven't noticed other issues, using this for a while in OSMD.
Dotted notes are perfect now.

By the way, most physical sheet music editions use a quarter plus eigth rest instead of a dotted quarter, easier to read and can align with other notes in the staff.

we had some problems in opensheetmusicdisplay/opensheetmusicdisplay#293 that grace notes shifted to the right everytime we redraw stuff.

Notes.jsx:
```
import Vex from 'vexflow';

import React, {Component} from 'react';

const {
    Accidental,
    Formatter,
    Stave,
    StaveNote,
    Renderer,
    EasyScore,
} = Vex.Flow;

export default class Notes extends Component {
    componentDidMount() {
        const {notes} = this.props;

        const svgContainer = document.createElement('div');
        const renderer = new Renderer(svgContainer, Renderer.Backends.SVG);
        const ctx = renderer.getContext();
        const stave = new Stave(0, 0, 100);  // x, y, width
        stave.addClef(""treble"").setContext(ctx).draw();
        const bb = Formatter.FormatAndDraw(ctx, stave, notes);

        const svg = svgContainer.childNodes[0];
        const padding = 10;
        const half = padding / 2;
        svg.style.top = -bb.y + half + Math.max(0, (100 - bb.h) * 2/3) + ""px"";
        svg.style.height = Math.max(100, bb.h);
        svg.style.left = ""0px"";
        svg.style.width = 100 + ""px"";
        svg.style.position = ""absolute"";
        svg.style.overflow = ""visible"";
        svgContainer.style.height = Math.max(100, bb.h + padding) + ""px"";
        svgContainer.style.width = 100 + ""px"";
        svgContainer.style.position = ""relative"";
        svgContainer.style.display = ""inlineBlock"";

        this.refs.outer.appendChild(svgContainer);
    }

    render() {
        return <div ref=""outer"" style={{
            border: ""2px blue solid"",
            padding: 10,
            borderRadius: 10,
            display: ""inline-block"",
        }}>
        </div>;
    }
}
```

For now I add notes by calling this from the container that will use the Notes component:
```
    render() {
        const bar = [new StaveNote({
            keys: [""c/0"", ""e/4"", ""g#/8""],
            duration: ""w"",
        })];

        return (
            <Container id={'exercise-container'}>
                <Notes notes={bar} />
            </Container>
        );
    }
```
Works fine!

But I would like to use EasyScore, so I tried it like this:
```
    render() {
     const score = new EasyScore();    
     const bar = {
            voices: [
                score.voice(score.notes('(C4 E4 G4)/q, D4/8, E4, F4, G4'))
            ]
        };

        return (
            <Container id={'exercise-container'}>
                <Notes notes={bar} />
            </Container>
        );
    }
```
It then returns a: TypeError: Cannot read property 'Voice' of null in vexflow0debug.js: on  return this.factory.Voice(voiceOptions).addTickables(notes);

Am I doing something wrong? 
Is there an easier way of getting it working with react?

This implements API documentation for VexFlow. It's not adding any new
prose - only converting existing comments to JSDoc-style comments,
moving certain comments to position them correctly.

Adds one new dependency:

- documentation

Adds two new npm run scripts:

- dev-docs: build & serve HTML docs
- docs: build Markdown docs into API.md

Adds documentation output: API.md

full-time job, significant side projects, and ongoing open source
commitments, so I don't have the bandwidth to get to 100% documentation
coverage or anything like that.

add more documentation, and find more old-fashioned comments that can just be

The only way I have found to create a note with a diamond notehead is via `Flow.keyProperties()`, and the way to get to that is by creating a `StaveNote` with `keys`.

But `Flow.keyProperties()` doesn't allow all the accidentals in [`Flow.accidentalCodes.accidentals`](https://github.com/0xfe/vexflow/blob/e107adf1b7c4512b4ec73d46b0e607332b5535b8/src/tables.js#L277). It uses [`Flow.keyProperties.note_values`](https://github.com/0xfe/vexflow/blob/e107adf1b7c4512b4ec73d46b0e607332b5535b8/src/tables.js#L127) instead, which only allows chromatic accidentals.

For example:

```js
// Works (G sharp)
new VF.StaveNote({keys: ['G#/4/D0']})

// Doesn't work (G three-quarter flat)
new VF.StaveNote({keys: ['Gdb/4/D0']})
```

I was able to create notes with the microtonal accidentals via `EasyScore.notes()`. But that option doesn't accept a glyph code (for the diamond).

So unless I'm missing something, it seems I can't have both.

In particular, it's made me realize that many of these things are a matter of taste, and we should allow an easy way to configure them.

I've been working to standardize the api for styling elements across the codebase and many (most) elements now implement `setStyle(styleObject)` and `getStyle()`.

I'm exploring adding the static methods `setDefaultStyle(styleObject)` and `getDefaultStyle()` on elements, which would allow things like:

``` javascript
const VF = Vex.Flow;
VF.Stave.setDefaultStyle({ strokeStyle: '#000000' });
VF.StaveNote.setDefaultFlagStyle({ fillStyle: 'orange' });

const note = new VF.StaveNote({ keys: ['c/4'], duration: '8' })
  .setStyle({ shadowColor: 'blue', shadowBlur: 15 });
  .setKeyStyle(0, { fillStyle: 'purple' }
...
note.setContext(ctx).draw(); // draws a purple note with an orange flag on a blue shadow
```

I've got this implemented on a branch for `StaveNote`, `Stave`, `NoteHead`, `Stem` and `Beam` but before I go much further I wanted to check in and see if this seems like a logical API structure to everyone?

I love the project and I am ready to start contributing in some way.  Years ago I created one of the 'ABC' variants (mine was iabc) but I think this is a much better approach.

I was able to build after Gregory Ristow's fix of webpack dependency a couple of weeks ago, but now webpack does not build for a different reason.  On both Windows 7 and Windows 10 I get:

> Running ""eslint:target"" (eslint) task
> 
> Running ""webpack:build"" (webpack) task
>  95% emit

The build will hang for hours and not progress.  I did some googling and it said this happens if there is a 'windows reserved character' in the output path, but there were no fixes that worked for me and it's not clear to me how to change it (I'm a bit of a grunt/npm noob). Also I know we are using an old version of webpack - I am able to build the latest version by itself.

Another build issue, but I don't think Windows-related:

Changes:
- Ledger line drawing is now handled entirely by `StaveNote`
- All ledger line logic is removed from `NoteHead`
- Ledger lines are now drawn with the same style of the staff they're related to
- If both displaced and non-displaced notes are present above or below the staff, ledger lines are drawn for both positions until no longer needed in either position.
- `Stave.setStyle()` is now available to match the api's of other `Element`s.
- `StaveNote.setLedgerLineStyle()` uses `Stave.getStyle()` as its default style, merging onto it any changes.

This results in two obvious visual changes throughout with ledger lines:
- Ledger lines are now thinner than before (1px, matching Vex.Flow.STAVE_LINE_THICKNESS)
- Ledger lines are now colored as `#999999` by default (matching `Stave.options.fill_style`'s default).

To my eyes, I really appreciate the consistency of style between the ledger lines and the staves. However: I find myself wondering if `#999999` is too light of a default now that the ledger lines are the same color and thinner. Thoughts?

Finally, the NoteHead Bounding Boxes test loses a ledger line because this logic is moved into `StaveNote`. This isn't a grave concern to me -- I think it's pretty unlikely anyone is using VexFlow in a way that they're relying on `NoteHead` to draw a ledger line. (And, anyway, it would only ever draw the final ledger line before a note -- not all of the ones between the note and the staff.)

(1) I cannot use the SVG rendering mode; due to Adobe AIR limitations, I'm stuck with Canvas.

I'm wondering why an error is thrown if the list of notes to be tupletized has length 1. The error is thrown from a check early in the tuplet process, before it's clear that it's really going to cause any problems.

I think it makes sense to have tuplets of length 1, e.g. if I have a single note of duration 1/7 and I want to notate it as an eighth-note, then I need to multiply it by 8/7.

Here's my general idea about how to notate the kinds of rhythms I'm working with.
Example measure durations: (1/7, 1/7, 2/9)
The sum of this is 32/63, so we can make an approximate measure of 2/4 time and tuple the whole measure by 64/63 to make it fit. This gives:

   
|------64/63-----------|
9/64 9/64 7/32

This is notatable, but in the general case it may not be, and anyway it would be better if the notes looked simple. So we can add a second (inner) layer of tuplets for each note/group of notes, to approximate them to (e.g.) eighths. 


    
|---------64/43-------|
|----9/8------||--7/8----|
  1/8 1/8 -------    1/4
 
Now everything adds up and is notated in ""square"" measures and notes.

---
One further thing would be to be able to change the way the tuplets print their numeric labels. The above is not clearly legible as (1/7, 1/7, 2/9). This means decoupling the label from the actual multiplier and allowing the user to specify it directly, overriding the default. E.g. we could relabel to show the true duration of an eighth-note.

 artist = new Artist(10, 10, 600, {scale: 0.8});
 vextab = new VexTab(artist);

function render() {
        try {
          vextab.reset();
          artist.reset();
          vextab.parse($(""#blah"").val());
          artist.render(renderer);
        } catch (e) {
          console.log(e);
        }
      }
```

So I introduce the notes in the Textare '#blah' with VexTab format and they are rendered in the  '#boo' canvas:

```
options space=20 tab-stems=true stave-distance=40 tab-stem-direction=down
tabstave notation=true key=A time=4/4
notes :q =|: (5/2.5/3.7/4) :8 7-5h6/3 ^3^ 5h6-7/5 ^3^ :q 7V/4 |
notes :8 t12p7/4 s5s3/4 :8 3s:16:5-7/5 :h p5/4
text :w, |#segno, ,|, :hd, , #tr

```

However, rather than just parsing and rendering in the '#boo' canvas, I also would need to have the information of the notes in a Voice object to do with it something like:

```
voice.tickables.forEach(function (tickable, i) {
	...
}
```

Is that possible?

Rationale (if you need one) : As a guitarist, fretboard diagrams are useful to specify not only the chord being played, but also the *voicing* of the chord, and it allows the notator / arranger to suggest a suitable hand position. Specifying all this info with regular notation alone is not ideal, and using tab notation is too restrictive for passages that are better notated with actual music (for example, melodies in a lead sheet).

Ideally the fretboard diagram API would allow the notator to specify an unambiguous voicing and to have some control over the parameters of rendering. This means: 

- fret / string positions of the notes
- number of frets to show (default is usually 4)
- label in front of specific fret(s) (usually numbers in Arabic or Latin numerals)
- number of strings to show
- tuning of each string
- diagram scaling factor
- diagram location offset

Particularly to help guide my contributions to the project. Some granularity in how your system hooks together is useful.

For a personal project, I used VexFlow as the formatting/rendering layer to build a music notation editing engine. I designed my own ""model"" layer, which was manipulated by a user, and I rebuilt/formatted/drew VexFlow objects whenever that model changed. Since my primary concern was prototyping iterating on a web-based notation editor, I was not concerned with flexibility around visual quality or styling. VexFlow worked quite well for this, but I also have a comprehensive understanding of the codebase.

At my current job at [Tido](http://tido-music.com/), we built a dynamic notation renderer with a highly modified build of VexFlow. Again, VexFlow objects were generated from a data model. This rendering engine appears in the iPad app [Mastering the Piano With Lang Lang](http://masteringthepianowithlanglang.com/). But even for Level 1 of the series (ie: basic educational piano), VexFlow proved to be inadequate for the quality and flexibility we required. So we only used it as a glorified glyph painter and wrote our own spanning elements (eg: hairpins, slurs) and our own formatting pipeline.",NA,FALSE,https://api.github.com/repos/0xfe/vexflow,https://api.github.com/repos/0xfe/vexflow/issues/520/labels{/name},https://api.github.com/repos/0xfe/vexflow/issues/520/comments,https://api.github.com/repos/0xfe/vexflow/issues/520/events,https://github.com/0xfe/vexflow/issues/520,NA

It's pretty awkward to use. And doesn't really flow with the setup-stave-by-stave expectation of the Factory.

Let's take a look at this test:

```javascript
var vf = VF.Test.makeFactory(options, 600, 350);
var score = vf.EasyScore();
var system = vf.System();

var voice = score.voice.bind(score);
var notes = score.notes.bind(score);

system.addStave({
  voices: [
    voice(notes('(d4 e4 g4)/q, c4/q, c4/q/r, c4/q', { stem: 'down' })),
    voice(notes('c#5/h., c5/q', { stem: 'up' })),
  ],
}).addClef('treble');

system.addStave({
  voices: [voice(notes('c#3/q, cn3/q, bb3/q, d##3/q', { clef: 'bass' }))],
}).addClef('bass');

system.addConnector().setType(VF.StaveConnector.type.BRACKET);

vf.draw();
```

If we look at the bass notes, notice that they will initially have their stave set to the treble `Stave` (because the bass stave hasn't been constructed by the Factory yet). So for the majority of the setup, the notes have the **wrong** stave set which only gets replaced at the very end when `Factory#draw` is called (because it calls `System#format` -- which is also really awkward, why is a drawing function calling a formatting function).",NA,FALSE,https://api.github.com/repos/0xfe/vexflow,https://api.github.com/repos/0xfe/vexflow/issues/519/labels{/name},https://api.github.com/repos/0xfe/vexflow/issues/519/comments,https://api.github.com/repos/0xfe/vexflow/issues/519/events,https://github.com/0xfe/vexflow/issues/519,NA

Some of these tests relied on formatting code that was executed *only if* missing a stave (which really doesn't make sense to me why any kind of multi-voice formatting would be attempted in this case). Anyway, we are soon making this an invalid state. So now, the rests are formatted by code that formats StaveNotes with a stave. But the output is not good. The vertical adjustments will have to be completely rewritten to take real bounding box metrics into account (but this can only happen once the new stave requirement is in place), and changes will need to be made to support >2 voices.

This is:
* perfect for stuff like attributes
  * eg `c#4/4[id=""note1"",class=""red""]`
* constraining but acceptable for simple modifier cases
  * eg: `c#4/4[articulations=""staccato.above,marcato.below""]`
* not useful for anything complex
* executed inline with parsing, so we can't expose anything ahead of the current position

With tagged template literals we could mix JavaScript expressions within the EasyScore language. 

Total Strawman:

```javascript
easyScore`
  (a4 e5 f5)/16
    ${modify({
      0: vf.Fingering({ number: '1', position: 'left' }),
      2: vf.Fingering({ number: '4', position: 'above' }),
    })}
  e5, e5 ${link(vf.Tie)} e5, e5/8, e5, e5/2
`;
```

In this example `modify` and `link` are higher order functions that return a function which will be passed something like: `(prevNote, nextNote, allNotes)`. In order to expose all parsed notes, these transformations would be run after all entire line has been parsed.

Just like YouTube videos, Twitter posts, Instagram images, etc. can be embedded in Medium.com stories, Facebook posts, tweets, and other (micro-)blog engines, it would be great to give musically-oriented users the ability to embed music snippets created with VexFlow. The difference between this and a dedicated blog engine like My VexFlow is that the latter is an uphill and essentially unwinnable battle to compete with professional blog engines with millions of dollars of funding.

Technically, this means:
- Create a host for VexFlow snippets. This would function like Github gists or JSBin. 
- Each snippet would have a permalink and would expose the necessary metadata for embedding: an oEmbed endpoint, Twitter Card metadata, Open Graph metadata.
- A new JS script that embeds the VexFlow code into a host page needs to be written. This script would be delivered by the oEmbed endpoint.
- For embeddability within Medium.com, this new host needs to be registered with Embedly as a [whitelisted provider](http://embed.ly/providers/new)

If I create a new StaveNote with the keys in a _particular order_ (notice how G/4 is a higher pitch than C/4 but I'm listing the notes out of order here):
`var chord = new Vex.Flow.StaveNote({ keys: ['G/4', 'E/4', 'C/4'], duration: '8'});`

I would like to be able to programmatically style my C/4 note, currently at `chord.keys[2]`, to be a different color than all other notes -- let's say that I generate the StaveNote programmatically and I know that the last key has a special meaning, and all other keys in the chord are listed in the order in which they're pressed down by the user on a MIDI input device, not in order of their pitch.

So now if I try to do this, expected it to make my C/4 note red:
`chord.setKeyStyle(2, {fillStyle: ""red""});`

When I render the note, G/4 note is colored red instead. I expected index 2 to match C/4 because that's how I listed the keys when I created the StaveNote. This is unintuitive and makes it harder for me to control the styling of my notes programmatically.

voice(notes, voiceOptions) {

  return this.factory.Voice(voiceOptions).addTickables(notes);

Vex.Flow.TIME4_4 = {
  num_beats: 8,   //results: shows two measure 
  beat_value: 4,
  resolution: Vex.Flow.RESOLUTION
};

which is passed to the `VF.Voice(Vex.Flow.TIME4_4).addTickables(notes);`

In that JSFiddle, if you add in the end this code:

You will notice that the note is removed, but the extra line draw at the end isn't, making this way of deleting inconsistent.

Now that we've implemented a variety of objects, it might be worth defining some conventions. I think there's a bit of inconsistency that could be ironed out.

Two forms of Factory method arguments exist so far:
1. An object with all config properties at the top level
   - The object is passed straight into the respective constructor
   - eg: `StaveNote(noteStruct)`, `GraceNote(noteStruct)`
2. An object with properties and a nested `options` object
   - The object is picked apart and the values passed appropriately -- this could be to a constructor or to subsequent method calls.
   - eg: `Beam(params)`, `Stave(params)`, `Annotation(params)`

For the latter, it's not really clear to me how the `options` object is intended to be used. Take the defaults for `Annotation` :

``` javascript
{
  text: 'p',
  vJustify: 'below',
  hJustify: 'center',
  fontFamily: 'Times',
  fontSize: 14,
  fontWeight: 'bold italic',
  options: {},
}
```

Since the font/justification properties are at the ""top level"", what goes in the `options` object? Not that they shouldn't be ""top level"" properties, but the distinction between the two tiers is not clear to me.

My guess is that the noteheads only get built on construction, and so changing the stem after construction does not change placement. That being said, the displacement of noteheads is certainly a kind of ""formatting"" and not something to be done on construction. However, that's a larger change, and in the meantime we should rebuild when `setStemDirection()` is called.

It allows us to index and keep track of VF elements in a document and query by various attributes. This allows us to build simpler APIs:

For example, we could add a Tie or Slur simply based on element IDs:

``` javascript
vf.Tie('foo', 'bar');
```

Or color all elements in a specific class red:

``` javascript
registry.getElementsByClass('specialnotes').forEach(n => n.setColor('red'));
```

Or we could build stylesheets that post-format generated notation (strawman):

``` javascript
registry.applyStyle('newstyle.css')
```

There are two ways to use the registry:

1) Explicitly register elements with a registry via `registry.register(element)`. This could be something a factory or builder does.
2) Use `Registry.enableDefaultRegitstry(registry)` to auto register any new elements with the specified registry.

It's not complete yet, but I'm sending this out for early review.

This refactors the `Builder` with a new property: `onCommit`. It's an array of functions which will will be run in sequence and passed `(currentOptions, note, factory)` -- the expected usage is around matching key/values in the `currentOptions` object and then transforming the `note` in some way. The `currentOptions` object is formed by the assigning the piece options into the builder options

I extracted the `id` setting into its own function. And also implemented articulations in this way:

```
c4/4[articulations='staccato.above,tenuto.below']

Most importantly, this provides the user with a hook for arbitrary extension.

Also, now that we have the `Factory` and `System` classes, there's a place to put it.
## Proposal

I propose a new method, `Factory.easyVoice(line, options)` that takes a string expressing a short sequence of music and creates the relevant VF objects.
## Usage

Using the factory to build everything:

``` javascript
let vf = VF.Factory();
vf.addStave();
vf.easyVoice('C5/8, D#5/8, Bbb4/w', options: {stem: up});
vf.draw()
```

Using the factory for just `easyVoice`:

``` javascript
let voice, elements = new VF.Factory().easyVoice('C5/8, D#5/8, Bbb4/w', options: {stem: up});
voice.setContext(ctx).setStave(stave);
new VF.Formatter().joinVoices([voice]).format([voice], 400);
voice.draw();

// Render beams, ties, etc.
elements.forEach(el => el.setContext(ctx).setStave(stave).draw())
```
## Examples
#### `easyVoice(""C5/8, D#5/8, Bbb4/w"")`

Constructs the three stave notes, C5, D5, and B5, of durations 8, 8, and w, and attaches the `#` and `bb` accidentals to the latter two. It sticks them in a voice, and returns `{voice: ..., elements: [...]}`.
#### `easyVoice(""(C#5 G5 E5)/w, D#5/8, Bb4/w"")`

Same as above, except the first `StaveNote` is a chord.
#### `easyVoice(""C#5 G5 E5)/w, D#5/8[id='foo', stem='up'], Bb4/w"")`

Same as above, except also set the `id` to `foo` and its stem facing upwards. The `[key=val,...]` syntax allows you to attach arbitrary properties to a note.
## Options

The `options` object passed into `Factory.easyVoice` can have properties that affect all the notes, like `stem` or `stave`.
## Grammar

The grammar for the line is straightforward, and can be built with a simple hand parser:

```
SLASH: /
LPAREN: (
RPAREN: )
LBRACKET: [
RBRACKET: ]
COMMA: ,
EQUALS: =
QUOTE: '
DOT: .
SPACE: \s+

groups: chord | chords
chords: chord COMMA
chord: (note | notes) (SLASH duration)? (SLASH type)? (dots)? (options)?
notes: LPAREN (note SPACE)+ RPAREN   
note: key accidental? octave?
key: [a-gA-G]
accidental: [#bn]*
octave: [0-9]+
duration: [0-9qhw]+
type: [rRsSxX]
dots: DOT+
options: LBRACKET (keyval | keyvals+) RBRACKET
keyvals: keyval COMMA
keyval: key EQUALS val
key: [a-zA-Z0-9-_]+

  newNote({ keys: ['e/4'], stem_direction: -1, duration: '8' }),
  newNote({ keys: ['f/4'], stem_direction: -1, duration: '8' }),
];

const someBuilderConfig = {
  domNodeSelector: canvasSelector,
  contextBuilder,
  width: 450,
  height: 500,
  staveSpace: 10
};

new Builder(someBuilderConfig)
  .addStave({
    x: 10,
    y: 10,
    transform: (stave) => stave.addClef('treble').addTimeSignature('4/4'),
  })
  .addStave({

    y: 150,
    transform: (stave) => stave.addClef('bass').addTimeSignature('4/4'),
  })
  .addVoice({
    staveIndex: 0,
    notes: topNotes,
    beams: [[0, 4], [4, 8]], // beams and tuplets are so common, maybe basic usage should get shortcuts?
  })
  .addVoice({
    staveIndex: 1,
    notes: bottomNotes,

Unfortunately, trying to implement this behavior exemplifies a big problem:
**The stave isn't necessarily set on all elements when formatting occurs.** So what should be a simple implementation, results in ~~~57~~ ~270 failed tests [because of this new error](https://github.com/0xfe/vexflow/compare/master...Silverwolf90:extend-stems-to-staff-middle?expand=1#diff-14d05dc59b818c53fb8a5a1cd38c1a22R139).
### Proposal

It should be a new requirement that the stave is set on all formatted elements **before** formatting occurs, which would also enable some big improvements to vertical formatting (see https://github.com/0xfe/vexflow/issues/411).

This also relates to better defining the formatting lifecycle (see https://github.com/0xfe/vexflow/issues/401).

Fundamentally, the mixing of elements should not be a complex case to handle: advance the position of the next element by some value derived from the previous element. There are implementation details around this, but the basic mechanism is the same. The current formatting lifecycle, specifically the `ModifierContext` (see https://github.com/0xfe/vexflow/issues/409) and the `.format()` methods make this much more convoluted then it needs to be, while also enforcing an inflexible ordering of `Modifiers` which is problematically opinionated.

Having different units for horizontal/vertical formatting is not ideal. But we can't escape that for now._

All these properties do is keep track of an incremented value in a specific direction. Isn't this already what the `Formatter` does? It advances a position forward along the x axis (albeit with complex logic to determine the amount...). It feels like the `ModifierContext` duplicates and conflates responsibilities since it tries to manage 4 positions at once. So what if we deprecated the `ModifierContext`, and replaced it with with a new, simpler formatter that takes `Modifier.Position` and advances a position given:
- a `Modifier.Position`
- Objects for formatting
- Config options, ie: spacing

To replace the `ModifierContext`, I think we'd need 4 differently parameterized versions of these (one for each `Modifier.Position`).

In fact, in order to format `GraceNotes` within a `GraceNoteGroup` we use the existing `Formatter` and set its available width to 0 that the minimum width for each note is applies. But this is clearly a hack based on the absence of a simpler formatter.

Now that glyph widths are not hard-coded, we can more easily increase glyph sizes to be more standard (and more visually pleasing).

Before this change, the default stem height was 32px. But this is non-standard given a stave with a default 10px staff space. Typically in standard music notation, the default stem height is 3.5 staff spaces (ie: 35px given a 10px staff spcae). The reason it was set to 32px is because the noteheads were too small, so a 35px stem looked too long. I've increased the size of the noteheads, in order for their height to take up an entire staff space. And increased the Stem to the standard 35px.

The crux of this change was replacing the `head_width` property of notehead glyphs in `tables.js`. It was replaced with a `.getWidth(fontScale)`.

I also extracted some of the common font scales into the `Flow` object.

Here are some of the tests with the new glyph sizes:

### Update (Aug 28th, 2016)

The addition of the `Factory` and `EasyScore` is a massive win for the last 3 points. I've begun refactoring a lot of the tests to use these classes. See https://github.com/0xfe/vexflow/pull/433, https://github.com/0xfe/vexflow/pull/431, https://github.com/0xfe/vexflow/pull/423, https://github.com/0xfe/vexflow/pull/420, https://github.com/0xfe/vexflow/pull/417

It's worth noting that VexFlow is soon going to a add a new requirement: **a `Stave` must be set on all appropriate `Elements` before formatting** (see https://github.com/0xfe/vexflow/pull/412 for the relevant discussion). However, the following tests still do not satisfy this requirement (see list at bottom of this post)

Basic voice creation can probably use `EasyScore` ([wiki](https://github.com/0xfe/vexflow/wiki/Using-EasyScore)) while more complex test setup might require extending and using the `Factory`.

[Example of refactoring using `EasyScore` - #433](https://github.com/0xfe/vexflow/pull/433)
[Example of refactoring using only the `Factory` - #417](https://github.com/0xfe/vexflow/pull/417)

However we still have the problem that we can't use ES6 -- I think we should transpile the tests when running them in a headless browser that requires ES5 (ie: PhatomJS).

I'm bringing this up because I was trying to make a very reasonable change to `StaveNote`:

Currently, a `StaveNote` sets the `x` value for it's `Noteheads` and `Stem` in it's `render()` method. But this is clearly the wrong place. We shouldn't be mutating anything in `render()`. So I moved that logic into `.postFormat()`. Since that's clearly the the place to set the `x` values. However, doing so broke _tons of tests_ because lots of them are doing things in the wrong order.

- Went through `Beam` and did a lot of renaming, most variable names were really vague and I think it's a lot easier to understand now.
- A lot of logic in `beam.applyStemExtensions` was just plain wrong mainly due to incorrect assumptions around stem coordinates because it's a [very confusing part of the codebase](https://github.com/0xfe/vexflow/wiki/Development-Gotchas) -- that method has been greatly simplified

Here's new class! AttrNoteGroup (I simply named as AttrNoteGroup because that kind of ClefNote etc are categorized by ""Attributes"" in MusicXML.. :) thanks for any other name recommendation if you have)

Current Attributes Notes system works in case of single-voice well,
but with current ""ignore_ticks"" option, it cannot handle multi-voice & multi-staff notes.

Here is an example below, ClefNotes are not formatted correctly.
<img width=""430"" alt=""screen shot 2016-07-04 at 6 22 17 pm"" src=""https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2025065/16556314/496c03ea-4214-11e6-9ae3-0dbd516255ab.png"">

I firstly thought modifying Formatter to support this kind of formatting, but it will make Formatter more complicated and Formatter already has this kind of formatting feature, Modifier.

It is similar with GraceNoteGroup, but it covers ClefNote, TimeSigNote and BarNote which can be categorized by ""Attributes"".
AttrNoteGroup makes Modifier for StaveNote using that kind of attributes notes.
So it makes Formatter handle multi-voice & multi-staff examples properly.

And, I didn't change other test cases which uses ClefNote, TimeSigNote or BarNote yet, but I think it's better to change those examples, too.
It will be better not to use that notes without AttrNoteGroup as we don't use GraceNote without GraceNoteGroup, how do you think of this?
And because current ""ignore_ticks"" works only for specific case (single-voice) and it can be also replaced by Modifier system, so it may be good to make it deprecated.
Only other class which has ""ignore_ticks"" statement is TextNote but it actually has no test cases for that.

It's so glad to see recent great improvements!
Here is a tiny commit.
I found we don't have GhostNote test cases and so it was missed out during es6 converting work.

I fixed it to work and added tests not to be forgotten in the future :)

Thanks!

It allows a project to define some basics (like indentation, newlines, etc.).  This way, editor applications can conform to these settings per-project.

I am a perfect use case as I prefer 4-space indentation, and I'd like my editor to default to that.  VexFlow uses 2 spaces, so if it has an .editorconfig, I don't have to constantly change the settings in my editors/IDEs.

The best thing is this just helps catch eventual linter errors before they happen, and it helps maintain code style.  It's totally opt-in since it requires a compatible editor.

The user has absolutely no control over how each `Position` was implemented for each class.

For an example of this, take a look at `StaveNote.prototype.getModifierStartXY`. This method is problematic because each returned `{ x, y }` pair comes with a non-obvious value. Calling `stavenote.getModifierStartXY(Position.ABOVE, 1)` gives no indication of the result of the  `x` coordinate. Is it the stem's x value? The center of the notehead for the provided index? The center of the entire stavenote's bbox? What happens with chords with displaced notes? What about rests? None of this is obvious or configurable. Confusingly, the x value represents the ""center of the non-displaced noteheads"" regardless of the provided key index. And the `y` value is the same for `Position.ABOVE` and `Position.BELOW`.

What if we extracted these code branches into stand-alone functions?

A more flexible and powerful API might look something like:

``` javascript
const Position {
  H: {
    noteStem: (note) => note.getStem().getX(),
  },
  V: {
    noteStemTip: (note) => note.getStemExtents().topY;
  }
};

// Place articulation at stem tip
articulation.setInitialPosition(Position.H.noteStem, Position.V.noteStemTip);
```

With functions we get the advantage of composability:

``` javascript
const stemTipPadded = compose(withPadding(20), Position.H.noteStemTip);
```

higher-order functions:

``` javascript
const noteheadPosition =
  (position) => (keyIndex) => (chord) =>
    position(chord.getNotehead(keyIndex));

const noteheadCenter = noteheadPosition(Position.H.center);
```

more complex, but still low-level, positioning logic is separated from higher level classes

``` javascript
const centeredBetween = (startNote, endNote) => {
  const left = Position.H.left(startNote);
  const right = Position.H.right(endNote);
  const width = right - left; 
  return left + (width / 2);
}
```

To me, this seems much simpler, more flexible, more powerful, and more obvious.

Curious to hear thoughts on this.

Here's what I'm thinking:
- Enable babel in the Rollup workflow
- Change all of the `Vex.Inherit(Class, SuperClass, ...)` calls to `export class Class extends SuperClass { ... }`
- Change all static properties to static getters and setters
- Change function declarations to the new class syntax (using `static` where appropriate)

Again, this can be done with source changes only.  The Quint tests and visual regression tests would serve as verification that nothing functionally has changed.

- Add static method `Glyph.getOutlineBoundingBox`
  - Did a bit of refactoring to share logic between this and `Glyph.renderOutline`
- Every time `glyph.reset()` is called, the `bbox` property is set
- `Glyph.getMetrics()` will now return the `width` and `height` of the `bbox`
- Removed `Glyph.setWidth()` since there should be no reason to manually set the width of a glyph

In the [old issue on SMuFL support](https://github.com/0xfe/vexflow/issues/181), we agreed on not using the metadata but a different set of hardcoded metrics, and I think that was a mistake. Being able to rely on SMuFL metadata entirely for layout will simplify the codebase. Now that I've used SMuFL pretty extensively, I'm in favor of going **all-in** on SMuFL, rather than ending up in some half-way state because we're trying to support Gonville too. It would still be a big net positive if we could use the SMuFL metadata, even at the cost of supporting Gonville. 

I do think we need to seriously consider what is gained from supporting Gonville. It's non-standard, has a minimal glyph set, completely lacks metadata, and adds complexity to the codebase to support it alongside SMuFL. Basically, now that SMuFL exists, I do not think VexFLow should aim to support non-standard music fonts.

If we did want to continue supporting Gonville alongside SMuFL we have to store data about Gonville that allows us to approprately transform and consume Gonville glyphs as if they were SMuFL compliant
- We need the following data on each Gonville glyph:
  - Horizontal origin alignment
  - Vertical origin alignment
  - Orientation for multi-line segments
    - All [multi-line segments](http://www.smufl.org/version/latest/range/multiSegmentLines/) in SMuFL are oriented horizontally but in Gonville _some_ are oriented vertically
  - SMuFL glyph name (eg: `accidentalSharp`) for the respective VexFlow Gonville glyph identifiers (eg: `vb9`)
- Some Gonville glyphs coincidentally match up with SMuFL (like noteheads), so it might only be necessary to maintain a mapping of deviations from SMuFL
- Provide SMuFL compliant metadata for Gonville glyphs

I don't have much time these days, but I figured I could lay down my thoughts on how we could get to SMuFL support and maybe we could agree on a plan.

I previously worked on a branch to support SMuFL ([branch](https://github.com/Silverwolf90/vexflow/tree/remove-hardcoded-head-width) related to https://github.com/0xfe/vexflow/issues/181), and while I got it into a working state it was quite a mess. Such a drastic change permeates through the entire codebase, and I'm not sure the current codebase is good enough to support such a large change in a clean manner. Although, the new testing infrastructure should also help significantly.

The first things that need to be done is to improve font infrastructure without doing anything SMuFL specific:
- **Rely _only_ on glyph metrics provided by automatic font processing**
  - Get accurate bounding box information for each glyph
    - In the font files, the height (eg: `Vex.Flow.Font.glyphs['v0'].ha`) values seem to be completely off. Take a look at the following image, but ignore horizontal/vertical alignment of the box on the glyph, it should be obvious that the height of some of the boxes clearly don't fit the glyphs.
      ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1631625/15986828/fdce9166-300a-11e6-916a-a4a8a0fecc47.png)
  - Bounding box data is generally not available on a per-glyph basis in most font encodings. But there are tools to extract the bounding box from an SVG path (I've not used them though):
    - https://github.com/icons8/svg-path-bounding-box
    - https://www.npmjs.com/package/svg-bounding-box
- **Implement horizontal/vertical origin alignment on the `Glyph` class**
  - Some kind of api like: `glyph.setAlignH('center')` `glyph.setAlignV('baseline')`
  - This removes need for low-level fine-tuning in high-level classes, ie: the `Ornament` class shouldn't need to worry about pixel amounts to center the `Glyph` at a point
  - I implemented this functionality in that old branch, probably a lot of that code can be re-used
- **Use appropriate glyphs for articulations that are `above`/`below`** 
  - VexFlow articulations only use the glyph meant for placement above a note, even if it placed below. But Gonville has specific glyphs with origin points meant for articulations placed below a note
  - Articulations should not need to rely on these awkward `shift_up` and `shift_down` properties in `Vex.Flow.articulationCodes.articulations`
- **!!! Remove all hardcoded numbers around glyph positioning !!!**
  - This is the most important thing to make SMuFL support as easy to implement as possible, all previous tasks in this issue are here to support this
  - This includes both magic numbers in the code and any hard coded glyph metrics or numbers for fine-tuning, there are a ton in `tables.js`
  - The exceptions are anything that can't be computed from the width/height, like `stem_extensions` for different durations with flags
  - This should not be done all at once, but a few at a time. Some hardcoded numbers, like notehead widths, might cause more changes than others.
- **Font sizes for relatively scaled objects, eg: `GraceNote`, should use a percentage scale rather than a hardcoded fontsize**
- **All glyph rendering should use the same API.**
  - Currently there is a mix between calling `new Glyph(...)`, `Glyph.renderGlyph(...)` `Glyph.renderOutline(...)`

At this point we should be in a pretty decent place to start thinking about supporting SMuFL compliant fonts.

My approach so far is to destroy all the vexflow created SVGs and redraw the whole canvas from scratch at every change. 

An issue I'm running into is that based on what key signature I've chosen to display, I have to re-calculate 

-The total width of the staves
-The width for the voice formatter
-The `noteStartX` values for my voices

Is there a best approach for this? The way I'm currently doing it is by 

-Drawing a staff with a key signature
-Measuring its `start_x`
-Subtracting `79.4353` that value from value, which is the value of `start_x` for C Major
-Destroying the dummy staff and then
-Using the newly calculated offset to push the aforementioned three values to the right that far on a new staff

It feels a little gross. A segment of my code below. 

``` javascript
    this.topStaff = new Vex.Flow.Stave(20, 0, this.staveWidth)
      .addClef(""treble"")
      .addTimeSignature(this.props.timeSig)
      .addKeySignature(this.props.keySig)
      .setContext(this.ctx)
      .draw();

    // The staff is drawn above, then the offset width is gotten below.
    // 79.4353 is the default width for C Major so that's what the
    // start_x is with no keySig selected
    this.offsetX = this.topStaff.start_x - 79.4353;

    // Then the dummy staff is cleared to make room for the real staves
    this.clearCanvas();

    // Now put real staves in with offset included in staff width
    this.topStaff = new Vex.Flow.Stave(20, 0, this.staveWidth + this.offsetX)
      .addClef(""treble"")
      .addTimeSignature(this.props.timeSig)
      .addKeySignature(this.props.keySig)
      .setContext(this.ctx)
      .draw();
```

later...

``` javascript
    // adding voices
    this.topVoice.addTickables(this.props.topNotes);
    this.bottomVoice.addTickables(this.props.bottomNotes);

    const formatter = new Vex.Flow.Formatter();
    formatter.joinVoices([this.topVoice])
    formatter.joinVoices([this.bottomVoice])
    formatter.format([this.topVoice, this.bottomVoice], this.staveWidth + this.offsetX);

    const maxX = Math.max(this.topStaff.getNoteStartX(), this.bottomStaff.getNoteStartX());
    this.topStaff.setNoteStartX(maxX + 24);
    this.bottomStaff.setNoteStartX(maxX + 24);

    this.topVoice.draw(this.ctx, this.topStaff);
    this.bottomVoice.draw(this.ctx, this.bottomStaff);
```

I didn't really find how to use SVG without Raphael. Here is an overview of the three options CANVAS, RAPHAEL and SVG.

**1. CANVAS:**
- In your html code of the website, create a `<canvas>` element with width and height and give it an id like id=""myCanvas"".
- In your javascript vexflow code do `var renderer = new Vex.Flow.Renderer(yourCanvasElement_ID, Vex.Flow.Renderer.Backends.CANVAS);`

**2. RAPHAEL**
- Raphael is deprecated, use SVG instead
- In your html code of the website, create a `<div>` element with width and height and give it an id like id=""myRaphaelCanvas"".
- In your javascript vexflow code do `var renderer = new Vex.Flow.Renderer(yourRaphaelCanvasElement_ID, Vex.Flow.Renderer.Backends.RAPHAEL);` 
- download and include the raphael-min.js javascript library to be loaded in your source code like you do with vexflow-min.js

**3. SVG**
- In your html code of the website, create a `<svg>` element with width and height and give it an id like id=""mySVGCanvas"".
- within the <svg> element, specify the argument `viewbox = ""0 0 width height""`and set it to the same width and height as specified in your `<svg>` element. I had to familiarize with how SVG coordinate systems work, with viewbox, viewport and preserveAspectRatio properties to see the output.
- In your javascript vexflow code do `var renderer = new Vex.Flow.Renderer(yourSVGElement_ID, Vex.Flow.Renderer.Backends.SVG);`
- no additional libraries required.

For SVG savvy people this may be boring stuff, but maybe a bunch of other non-experts like me would like to see a summary of options like this. @Mohit: Maybe it fits into the VexFlow tutorial.

I would like to share something that took me time to figure out.

Accidentals get aligned correctly and do not collide when the FormatAndDraw() method is used, but if you have a grand piano staff, notes in different staves can not be aligned with the same x position using FormatAndDraw().
The solution to align the notes is to not use FormatAndDraw(), but do it manually by creating voices for treble and bass staves, formatting them with a formatter like shown in step 2 of the VexFlow tutorial and draw the voices. The important part is to **not join the voices.**
If you do it that way, the notes are now correctly aligned, but the accidentals are colliding with each other.
That is because within the joinVoices() method, something gets called that aligns the accidentals. 
Workaround:
**You have to call the joinVoices() method for each voice individually, not to join voices, but to align accidentals.
Then format treble and bass voices together to the stave, but do not join them together.**

``` javascript
//create a voice for treble stave and one for bass stave
var voiceTreble = new Vex.Flow.Voice({num_beats:timeSignatureNumerator, beat_value: timeSignatureDenominator, resolution:Vex.Flow.RESOLUTION});
var voiceBass   = new Vex.Flow.Voice({num_beats:timeSignatureNumerator, beat_value: timeSignatureDenominator, resolution:Vex.Flow.RESOLUTION});

//add tickables (you pass the notes (staveNotes) that you have created before
voiceTreble.addTickables(yourStaveNotesForTrebleStave);
voiceBass.addTickables(yourStaveNotesForBassStave);

//do this if you want to get beams (manually)
var beamsTreble = Vex.Flow.Beam.applyAndGetBeams(voiceTreble);
var beamsBass = Vex.Flow.Beam.applyAndGetBeams(voiceBass);

var formatter = new Vex.Flow.Formatter();   //create a formatter

//joinVoices is the method which invokes something that renders the accidentals in the right way without colliding, but enter only one voice at a time for aligning the accidentals. You don't want to really join the voices
formatter.joinVoices([voiceTreble]);   
formatter.joinVoices([voiceBass]); 

//now align the voices to fit the grand piano staff. They are put in the array all together, but they are not joined together. In the second argument, you enter only the treble stave as stave here, assuming the bass stave and the treble stave have the same width as they are a grand piano staff
formatter.formatToStave([voiceTreble, voiceBass],yourTrebleStave, {align_rests: true});

var max_x = Math.max(yourTrebleStave.getNoteStartX(), yourBassStave.getNoteStartX());
yourTrebleStave.setNoteStartX(max_x);
yourBassStave.setNoteStartX(max_x);

//draw voices and beams, ctx is the context you got from your CANVAS / SVG
voiceTreble.draw(ctx, yourTrebleStave);
voiceBass.draw(ctx, yourBassStave);

if (beamsTreble != null) {
  for (var i=0; i<beamsTreble.length; ++i) {
    beamsTreble[i].setContext(ctxMain).draw();
  }
}
if (beamsBass != null) {
  for (var i=0; i<beamsBass.length; ++i) {
    beamsBass[i].setContext(ctxMain).draw();
  }
}

Detailed instructions given. This is a half-hour job.

See graphics below for cases not handled: two notes of unequal duration that together form a triplet (or in the general case, n notes of unequal duration that together form an m-tuplet).

The tuplet module takes two integer prarmeters,
num_notes and 
beats_occupied

Currently, parameter num_notes sets the number of notes to be affected, in this case 2, but also sets the glyph above the bracket, which should be 3 in this case. 

Notice also that the scaling is incorrect so that notes sounding together are not printed vertically aligned. In this case, all note durations should be scaled to take up 2/3 of their usual horizontal space.

In the most general case, tuplets require three integers to be specified: the number of notes falling under the bracket, and the ratio that the notes are scaled by. In the most common case, the ratio is 2/x (i.e. quintuplets are scaled by 2/5). By convention, in the 2/x cases the bracket says only x (3 for triplets, 5 for quintuplets), otherwise the (inverted) scaling ratio is shown. 

It would be possible to cover the great majority of useful cases with only two integers of input, by assuming that the numerator of the scaling ratio is 2. The module currently takes this numerator (as beats_occupied) but NOT the important denominator. It would be a very quick fix to the code to change the spec so that the second input ""beats_occupied"" functioned as the denominator here; both for glyph and scaling purposes.

The most general implementation would need to take both a numerator and denominator for the scaling ratio; the third graphic below shows a score by Stockhausen that requires this notation. This is correct, meaningful notation which should ideally be representable, but these are ""advanced"" cases that are not used nearly as often as those in the first graphics, which are extremely common and should definitely be represented. 

It may be slightly more complicated to do this more general fix, since modules other than tuplet.js would need to be touched, as the input type to tuplet is changed, but the easier fix mentioned above would only affect this module, and current correct functionality would be maintained (e.g. num_notes = 3, beats_occupied = 2).

I can't understand why and stave generated a great white space in the canvas, as margin, but, i think that will be because many lines under of stave will be generated.

A bounty of $5,000 (USD) will be awarded to the first person (or team) that can build a MusicXML parser that renders notation with VexFlow. The winner will also be eligible for up to $5,000 of additional development work (so really, this is a $10,000 bounty.)
## The Goal

The goal is to implement a MusicXML parser that generates VexFlow notation, similar to how VexTab does.
- The parser must fully support the MusicXML 3 specification.
- Code must be written in ES6, well commented, and neatly organized.
- Code must work in all major browsers in both Canvas and SVG.
- Code is expected full test coverage, along with visual tests for each of the features (similar to the VexFlow tests.)
- VexFlow itself might need updates to support various MusicXML features -- you will send PRs to 0xfe/vexflow to implement these features.
## How this will work
- If you're participating, contact me at `mohit@muthanna.com` and let me know. I encourage you to communicate with me regularly as you build this.
- Submit your finished repository to `mohit@muthanna.com` a `tar.bz2` (or `gz` or `zip` or whatever) archive. 
- Make sure to include a `README.md` file with build instructions, test instructions, documentation, etc.
- I will review and evaluate your work, and possibly send it back requesting minor changes, corrections, or more information.
- If I like it, you win! You get a check for $5,000, and we might work together on further improvements or other projects (also for which you will get paid.)
## Terms and Conditions

(Sorry, but I have to do this.)
- You must be in a country where such bounties are legal, and where there are no trade restrictions placed by the US or Canada.
- Your participation in this bounty will not violate any law applicable to you, or disrupt or compromise any data that is not your own.
- You are solely responsible for any applicable taxes, withholding or otherwise, arising from or relating to your participation in this bounty, including payments.
- You must be at least 13 years old to participate. If you're under 18, you need to get guardian consent before any payment can be made.
- If you win, you must transfer full ownership of the code to me. This means that you may be unable to use, build derivative works from, or redistribute any code developed for this bounty.
- I reserve the right to modify, discontinue, or terminate this bounty at my discretion.
- I shall not be liable to you or to any third-party for any damages that you may incur as a result of your participation in this bounty.
## FAQ

Answers to some questions that have been asked so far.
- Does it have to be pure ES6?
  Yes. ES6 all the way.
- Can I translate from another library or language (e.g., an existing C++ MusicXML parser.)?
  No. For ownership reasons, the code has to be entirely your own.
- Is there a deadline for this bounty?
  There is no deadline, but that may change in the future to something reasonable.
- Should I develop this in the open?
  Use good judgement. There's nothing stopping someone else from claiming your code as their own and submitting it.
- How much test coverage is good enough?
  It is important that the final product be easy to maintain, so full test coverage is a hard requirement. Yes, it's tedious, but you will build a better product that way.
- What runtime dependencies can I use?
  Please try to keep dependencies at a minimum. Ideally, the only dependency you will need is VexFlow, but I can grant one-off exceptions for lightweight open-source libraries such as lodash. If you're not sure, please check with me before you add a new dependency.
- I'm interested. How do I start?
  Just start. Feel free to send me an e-mail letting me know that you did (or not, it's entirely up to you.) Although, I encourage you to keep a line of communication open with me.

As noted by myself [on the forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/vexflow/9pIlvUhclpU), there seems to be an issue with positioning of annotations below stemless notes (using `VerticalJustify.BOTTOM`). The following code illustrates the correct behaviour, with a stemmed note (quarter note):

```
var canvas = $(""div.sandbox div.sandbox canvas"")[0];
var renderer = new Vex.Flow.Renderer(canvas, Vex.Flow.Renderer.Backends.CANVAS);
var ctx = renderer.getContext();

var stave = new Vex.Flow.Stave(10, 10, 300).addClef(""treble"").setContext(ctx).draw();

var notes = [
  new Vex.Flow.StaveNote({ keys: [""a/3""], duration: ""4"" })
    .addModifier(0, new Vex.Flow.Annotation(""ppp"")
    .setFont('gonville', 16, 'italic')
    .setVerticalJustification(Vex.Flow.Annotation.VerticalJustify.BOTTOM))
]

Vex.Flow.Formatter.FormatAndDraw(ctx, stave, notes);
```

If we subtitute a whole note, however, the annotation seems to always stick to the bottom of the stave, rather than being rendered below the note:

```
var canvas = $(""div.sandbox div.sandbox canvas"")[0];
var renderer = new Vex.Flow.Renderer(canvas, Vex.Flow.Renderer.Backends.CANVAS);
var ctx = renderer.getContext();

var stave = new Vex.Flow.Stave(10, 10, 300).addClef(""treble"").setContext(ctx).draw();

var notes = [
  new Vex.Flow.StaveNote({ keys: [""a/3""], duration: ""1"" })
    .addModifier(0, new Vex.Flow.Annotation(""ppp"")
    .setFont('gonville', 16, 'italic')
    .setVerticalJustification(Vex.Flow.Annotation.VerticalJustify.BOTTOM))
]

Vex.Flow.Formatter.FormatAndDraw(ctx, stave, notes);
```

Using `addAnnotation` instead of `addModifier` has no affect.

(BTW I use annotations rather than `TextNote` objects as I don't want to pollute my internal note array with 'non-music' notes, or have to add an extra `Voice` to hold them).

Here are two screenshots showing the result of the above code (taken from the [VexFlow Sandbox](http://www.vexflow.com/docs/sandbox.html)). The first shows the correctly positioned annotation with a quarter note, the second the incorrect positioning with a whole note:

At first, thanks so much for adding such kind of really nice visual regression test.
I made lots of change in this PR and it wasn't be possible without the visual regression test.

Changes in this PR are below,
## Replacing StaveModifier handling system from using glyphs to modifiers only

There were little bit special stave modifiers which added into stave begin or end: Clef, TimeSignature and KeySignature.

When stave.addClef(or addKeySignature, addTimeSignature) called, that stave modifier generates glyphs and add to stave right that time. But it makes stave hard to modify stave modifier values because stave.glyphs works independently with modifiers after added.
So, I removed current stave glyph system (in case of end_glyphs, I added it 2014...) and now stave only uses modifiers with self formatting.
#### Add StaveModifier.Position

Now StaveModifier has position which Modifier has, but there are new types BEGIN and END.
ABOVE, BELOW, LEFT, RIGHT positions does not require formatting but BEGIN and END requires formatting before drawing.

BEGIN and END are for Clef, TimeSignature, KeySignature and StaveBarline.
#### Make StaveBarline to be normal StaveModifier likes Clef, TimeSignature and KeySignature.

StaveBarline can have BEGIN or END positions.
Previously StaveBarline was a kind of exceptional case in case of stave's stavemodifier handling, but now it works similarly like other stave modifiers.
#### Auto alignment of BEGIN && END stave modifiers

Now, stave automatically fix order between clef, time, key and barline.
Like this example below, I didn't change test codes but result is different,

These also include the Iranian notation for half-sharp and half-flat, which are depicted in Persian Wikipedia's pages on [sori](https://fa.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D8%B3%D8%B1%DB%8C_%28%D9%85%D9%88%D8%B3%DB%8C%D9%82%DB%8C%29) and [koron](https://fa.wikipedia.org/wiki/%DA%A9%D8%B1%D9%86), respectively.

Ideally, a different identifier should be used for the western and eastern half-notes, so they can coexist in the same sheet if need be. An example of when this is needed is when sheet music is being written for many instruments (as is used by conductors) some of which are oriental instruments and some western instruments but all can play quarter tones.

-- UPDATE --

As shown below, vexflow already supports the Western quarter tone accidentals. There is need for support of Iranian accidentals though.

I have a question in how the distance and the position works in stavehairpin...

I can see in renderHairpin you have some logic of setting the y value of the hairpin depending on whether it is above or below the stave.  What I am slightly confused about is you have some hardcoded values which are added on (+20 is below the stave, +30 if above the stave).  Are these just hardcoded margins that set the position away from the stave?  How do these work if you were rendering larger / smaller than normal? 

I have some specific positioning for the y value (i.e. has come from musicXML) and I'm wondering if I have to offset the +20 and +30 accordingly as my values are true offsets from the top of the stave...

Any advice would be great!

Cheers!
Josh

Even then, there is an inconsistent result.

The following code produces a StaveNote:

``` javascript
var n = new Vex.Flow.StaveNote({ keys: [""f/5""], duration: ""16"", dots: 1});
n.dots === 1; //true
n.getIntrinsicTicks(); //1536
```

...but there is no dot visible when the note is rendered.  In order to get that to happen, you have to do:

``` javascript
var n = new Vex.Flow.StaveNote({ keys: [""f/5""], duration: ""16"" });
n.addDotToAll();
n.dots === 1; //true
n.getIntrinsicTicks(); //1024

This is inconsistent.  By adding dots in the note constructor, no dot is rendered, but the dot count and note ticks are correct.  By adding dots after the fact (with `addDotToAll()`), the dot is rendered, the dot count is incremented, but the note ticks do not change.

I'm wondering what the desired fix is here.  My first impulse is to have the constructor-supplied `dots` parameter behave the same as the a subsequent call to `addDotToAll()`:
- When dots are defined in the constructor, the dot count and ticks will be correct, and a dot will be rendered.
- When addDotToAll() is called, the dot count will be incremented, the tick count will get incremented, and the added dot will be rendered.

The final bit of confusion is the fact that `addDot(index)` is possible... What is the desired result of `note.dots` and `note.getIntrinsicTicks()` when a dot is added to only one note in the voice?

The current, default behavior of generateBeams() is unchanged.

The offset for the flat beam can be universally applied for all of the notes sent to generateBeams(), or it can be automatically calculated per beam group.

To enable flat beams with different heights per beam group, send in `flat_beams: true` to the generateBeams() options.

If the same height is desired for all of the beams in the set of notes sent to generateBeams(), a 2nd parameter, `flat_beam_offset`, can be passed along with `flat_beams: true`.  This parameter is ignored if `flat_beams` is `false` (the default).

This pull request is a significant rewrite of the accidental layout engine, to bring it more in line with layouts as described by Elaine Gould (_Behind Bars_).  In particular:
- Not all accidentals need the default 3-line vertical clearance.  Double sharps require only 2.5 on either side; flats and double flats require only 2.5 below.
- Generally, when three notes have accidentals with vertical crashes, the accidental of the middle note is placed farthest to the left.  (This is not the case, however, when the interval of the lowest two accidentals is a second.)
- Tightens spacing for widely-spaced chords.
#### Examples:

Here's a comparison of the old layout engine and the new:

This pull request extends the current styling options by allowing styling of stems (previously only noteheads & modifiers were supported) and adding an ease-of-use function to allow the styling of a complete Vex.Flow.StaveNote with one call.

Added setStyle() class to stavenote.js, to set a style for each key and to the stem.
Added three styling classes to stem.js:
- setStyle() -- set a style for the stem
- getStyle() -- return the stem's style
- applyStyle() -- update the rendering context with the style for drawing

Added drawNoteStyles() test to stavenote_tests.js

We can automate this using the following procedure for every test that generates an image:
1. Calculate a perceptual hash for the image. Good-known-hashes are committed to the repo.
2. If there was a prior committed hash calculated then calculate the distance between the two hashes.
3. If the distance exceeds a constant threshold, fail the test and highlight regions of the image with differences.
4. If the changes were intentional, commit the new hash to the repo. 

To get this right, we need:
1. An appropriate perceptual hashing algorithm for low-noise images.
2. A distance function for the hashes. (Assuming the hashes are vectors in a finite space.)
3. A constant threshold. (This is tunable.)

At first thank you very much for very perfect project. I am using your libruary in my project and cannot figure out the way to implement my project without your library.

I am stuck at rendering tuplet technique. Would you please help me to fix the problem or correct me if I am wrong.

Detail is: I am rendering 2 staves for piano music notation (left and right hand), every thing is greate, but in case there is a tuplet in one stave then the X Position of notes of 2 staves cannot be sync correctly. I attached the image for your refer.

1. Fixes positioning of Whole Rest
2. Normalizes rest positioning across all clefs while using the key type `R`, ie: `keys: [""r/4""]`. _(But really the octave is irrelevant, we just need it to not break key parsing)_

Basically, in `StaveNote.calculateKeyProps()` I simply override the `line` value if the `props.key` is `""R""`. Let me know if you'd prefer a different way of fixing this.

I also modified the `stavenote_tests.js`, so all rests simply take `r/n`.

Looking more closely at `voice.ticksUsed.value()` and `voice.totalTicks.value()`, the problem comes with the comparison of ticks on floating point values.  For instance, putting 6 quarter note triplets into a 3/2 bar gives me ticksUsed and totalTicks values of `16384 16383.999999999998`, while 2 quarter notes + 10 5:4 eighth note tuplets gives `24576 24576.000000000004`.

Two possible patches:

(1. untested) compare based on fractions or give an epsilon to the comparisons in voice.js (`this.ticksUsed.value() > this.totalTicks.value()`) and formatter.js (`voice.getTotalTicks().value() != totalTicks.value()` should be `!(voice.getTotalTicks.equals(totalTicks))`; also suggest change error message from ""`Voices should have same time signature.`'' to '`'Voices should have same total note duration in ticks`'' since the former caused me to chase down the TimeSignature glyph).

(2. tested but may have other consequences) change the voice.getTotalTicks function from `{ return this.totalTicks }` to `{ return new Vex.Flow.Fraction(Math.round(this.totalTicks.value()), 1); }` and getTicksUsed to `{ return new Vex.Flow.Fraction(Math.round(this.ticksUsed.value()), 1); }`.

This isn't totally complete. The main issue right now is lines 27-54 in `KeySignature.addAccToStave()`. In order to position the glyph combinations in an aesthetically pleasing way, there's some fine-tuning that has to be applied depending on the next accidental glyph and whether it's above/below the current accidental glyph. Right now it's all hard-coded but should be moved somewhere else. Where should we keep this data? Is this data worth storing in `Vex.Flow.accidentalCodes`? Or make it private data within the `KeySignature` module?

I had to make a change to `glyph.js`. Typically, the glyph width can be found via the `.getMetrics()` which would calculate the width based on `x` coordinates. This gave you an exact width of the glyph, but did not provide any spacing if you wanted it. And the combining of different glyphs in a key signature requires spacing. So I added a `setWidth()` method which essentially overrides the calculated width in `getMetrics()` and allows us to set custom widths for a glyph.

Additionally, I refactored `KeySignature` and `Vex.Flow.keySignature()` to use the accidental codes instead of glyph codes.

- You can provide custom text through the `.setCustomText(depress, release)`. Where `depress` and `release` is the custom text for each pedal action.
- Three Different Styles - based off of lilypond
  - `TEXT` style defaults to the traditional _Ped_ and _asterix_ glyphs, unless custom text has been provided. This style only supports **depress** and **release** actions on separate notes. Trying to do both on the same note will simply draw overlapping text.
  - `BRACKET` draws bracket based marking and supports **release and depress** on the same note. Which will draw the little tooth.
  - `MIXED` draws the depress text (either the default _Ped_ glyph, or the custom text), followed by the brackets. This also supports **release and depress** action. But will not render the release text, only a release bracket.
- Helper functions to draw common pedal markings `.createSustain(notes)`, `.createSostenuto(notes)`, `.createUnaCorda(notes)`
# Code Examples

``` javascript
  // Create a new pedal marking. Each note in the array toggle back and forth 
  // between a depress/release action

  // Set the style of the pedal marking

This clutters up `Articulation` a bit, so let me know what you think of the code. We've only dealt with articulations on `StemmableNotes` up to this point and these markings are stemless. So I had to do some checks to make sure to make `Articulation` didn't try and access stem data that didn't exist.

I won't copy the full SVG but here's a comparison of the text before and after drawing the notes:

``` html
<text x=""400"" y=""15.88888888888889"" text-anchor=""middle"" font=""normal 16pt times"" stroke=""#000000"" fill=""#000000""

</text>
```

``` html
<text x=""550"" y=""125.88888888888889"" text-anchor=""middle"" font=""normal 16pt times"" stroke=""#000000"" fill=""#000000"" 
stroke-width=""1"" style=""-webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); text-anchor: middle; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 16pt; line-height: normal; font-family: times;"">
  <tspan dy=""6.756076388888886"" style=""-webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);"">
    Below Text
  </tspan>
</text>
```

The key difference is the `stroke-width` goes from 0.3 to 1. 

I believe the problem is in `Vex.Flow.RaphaelContext`:

```
    fillText: function(text, x, y) {
      this.paper.text(x + (this.measureText(text).width / 2),
          (y - (this.state.font_size / (2.25 * this.state.scale.y))), text).
        attr(this.attributes);
      return this;
    }
```

where the attributes ends up:

```
{stroke-width: 1, fill: ""black"", stroke: ""black"", font: ""normal 16pt times""}
```

And it seems to be getting it from the stems on the notes.

This pull request adds the `Accidental.generateAccidentals(voices, keySignature)` static method for applying accidentals to voices. Works with double sharps/flats.

To be used like this:

``` javascript
Vex.Flow.Accidental.generateAccidentals([voice0, voice1], ""Ab"");
```

By passing in multiple voices, the accidentals will be remembered between the voices. This facilitates a few different accidental placement styles where accidental ""remembering"" can happen per voice, per staff or even per grandstaff. Simply include the voices you wish to have accidentals remembered between.

However, I'm thinking about changing the name of the method. `generateAccidentals` sounds like it would return an array of `Accidental` objects (like `generateBeams()`). When in reality, it simply adds them to the StaveNote. So maybe I should rename it to `autoApplyAccicdentals()` or something else ?

Some comments are more helpful than others...

Also, to make `NoteHead` inherit from `Note` and function correctly a few changes had to be made.
1. Had to override `.setStave()`
2. Needed to override `.preFormat()`
3. Needed to change `.getAbsoluteX()` 

So essentially, `NoteHead` handles two cases now, being used internally in `StaveNote` where it doesn't get formatted. Or being placed directly in a voice, where it does format. Note that `.getAbsoluteX()` won't fail if there is no `TickContext`, but will simply default to the `x` value that was set manually (usually by a `StaveNote`). If it has been preformatted, then it goes with the `tickContext`'s x position.

To draw an individual `NoteHead` you could simply add the following object to a `voice` and draw toa  a stave:

``` javascript
var note_head = new Vex.Flow.NoteHead({
  duration: ""2"",
  line: 2.5
});
```

`StaveNote.setKeyStyle()` now delegates to `NoteHead`. No more notehead style data is stored in StaveNote.

The code that i removed in `note.js` was leftover stuff from early gracenote stuff that shouldn't have been committed.

I know you mentioned you're out of town, so no rush to review this :) 

`NoteHead`s are now created on construction through a `buildNoteHeads()` method. Note that this method has to be called in  `setKeyStyle()` because all the style data for each notehead lives in `StaveNote` and so the noteheads have to be rebuilt everytime they change. I should add a `NoteHead.setStyle()` and have `StaveNote.setKeyStyle()` delegate rather than storing indices of each key with the corresponding style.

The `NoteHeads` get their `y` value provided when `setStave()` is called. Ultimately, I think that the `ys` array should be removed from `StaveNote` and that `getYs()` and `setYs()` should access and mutate the `NoteHead`s directly rather than maintaining the y values in two separate places.

The `x` value for each `NoteHead` is added applied within `StaveNote.draw()`, trying to put this in `preFormat()` doesn't work because it's preformats before the `TickContexts` have x values.

I had to refactor `StaveNote.draw()` significantly. Which led me to extracting a bunch of functions:
- `getNoteHeadBeginX()`
- `getNoteHeadEndX()`
- `getNoteHeadBounds()` - returns an object with the y value and staff line for the top and bottom notehead
- `drawLedgerLines()`
- `drawNoteHeads()`
- `drawFlag()`
- `drawModifiers()`

I extracted methods out of  `StaveNote.init()` as well:
- `calculateKeyProps()`
- `autoStem()`

I plan on implementing `Stem` and `Flag` as first class elements as well. But I figure I'd throw this up as a preliminary request so you can code review and tell me if I'm on the right/wrong track.

This happens because the articulation displacement above the stem is based on the default stem extensions. But they should be based on the stem extensions determined by the beam. The issue is that stems for the beam are created in the `draw()` method of the beam. 

In fact, even without beams, a `Stem`'s lifespan in a `StaveNote` begins in the `draw()` method as well. So there's no way to really sore and then modify it. It almost seems more ideal to have a `Stem` be created on construction and actually used as a persistent property (instead of a drawing helper), and applying a beam to a group of notes would modify their `Stems`, as opposed to beams handling the entire logic for drawing the beamed `Stems` within the `Beam.draw()` method.

I'm thinking we should completely remove `StemmableNote.stem_extension` and have the glyph contain the full extensions (currently I implemented the new glyph properties as adjustments to the `stem_extension`). It would just require a refactor to make sure hard coded instances of `stem_extension` are removed. This would also allow us to remove setting the `stem_extensions` in `StaveNote.init()`

Also note that I have another pull request incoming that improves the dot styles. So that there is a little more space between the notehead and the first dot, and the radius is slightly smaller. So they'll be slightly smaller and farther than the flag than they are at the moment.

As you can see, the second voice is offset from the first. While this is a somewhat contrived example, the same thing happens when trying to align notes on different staves.

- Adds a `StemmableNote` class which `TabNote` and `StaveNote` now derive from
- Renames `noteGlyph` property to `glyph` in `TabNote` (possible confusion between the new `TabNote.glyph` and `TabNote.glyphs`; the former is for storing duration glyph data and the the latter is for storing the fret position glyph data)
- Extracted out a new method called `drawStem()` into `StemmableNote`. Assigns the created `Stem` object to a `stem` property on the note, so you can access the stem properties at a later time after drawing
- `Beam.draw()` now uses the new method `StemmableNote.drawStem()` instead of its own stem drawing logic.

I figure stems could be enabled by a flag in `TabNote.render_properties` and that the `stem_direction` would indicate the top or bottom side of the stave.

Right now it's kind of hacked together with a lot of duplicate code in `StaveNote` and `TabNote`. They both need the following functions: `hasStem()` `getStemDirection()` `setBeam()` `getStemX()` `getStemExtents()` So I'm not sure how to handle this. It doesn't make sense to extract these into `Vex.Flow.Note` since some subclasses like `Vex.Flow.TextNote` don't need stems, and adding a `StemmedNote` to the prototype chain seems like overkill. So my initial thought is to extract it all into some sort of `Stemmable` mixin.

We at [VersionEye](https://www.versioneye.com/signup?promo_code=BOWER) are working hard to keep up the quality of the bower's registry.

We just finished our initial analysis of the quality of the Bower.io registry:

**7530** - registered packages, _224_ of them doesnt exists anymore;

We analysed **7306**  existing packages and  **1070** of them don't have bower.json on the master branch ( _that's where a Bower client pulls a data_ ).

Sadly, your library `0xfe/vexflow` is one of them.

Can you spare **15** minutes to help us to make Bower better?

Just add a new file `bower.json` and  change attributes.

```

Read more about bower.json [on the official spefication](http://bower.io/#defining-a-package) and nodejs [semver](https://github.com/isaacs/node-semver#ranges) library has great examples of proper versioning.

This is such a great project and I would like to use and contribute to it. One thing that would make it much easier to work with is if the repository used semantic version numbers (http://semver.org/) and tags.

I followed the instructions in the README and it isn't working for me. It could well be an issue with my setup and will continue to work through it.

I want to use vexflow in my site to draw musical sheets of Turkish Classical Music songs. But Turkish Classical Music(a.k.a ""maqam music"") has some keyspecs that has several accidentals.

I tried to customize `Vex.Flow.keySignature.keySpecs` array and `Vex.Flow.keySignature` constructor function, but I couldn't success to define that kind of spec.

I tried something like that:

    width: 10,
    shift_right: 0,
    shift_down: 0

Vex.Flow.keySignature.keySpecs[""Saba""] = [{
  acc: ""b4"", line: 2

  acc: ""b1"", line: 3
}];

var keySpecsBackup = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(Vex.Flow.keySignature.keySpecs));

Vex.Flow.keySignature = function(spec) {
  var keySpec = Vex.Flow.keySignature.keySpecs[spec];

  if (!keySpec) {
    throw new Vex.RERR(""BadKeySignature"",
        ""Bad key signature spec: '"" + spec + ""'"");
  }

  // It it's not an array, make it array
  if( Object.prototype.toString.call( keySpec ) !== Object.prototype.toString.call( [] ) ) {
    keySpec = [keySpec];
  }

  var acc_list = [];

  for (var i = 0, count = keySpec.length; i < count; i++) {
    var currentKeySpec = keySpec[i];

    if (!currentKeySpec.acc) {
      continue;
    }

    var code = Vex.Flow.accidentalCodes.accidentals[currentKeySpec.acc].code;

    if (currentKeySpec.line) {
      acc_list.push({glyphCode: code, line: currentKeySpec.line});
    } else {
      var notes = Vex.Flow.keySignature.accidentalList(currentKeySpec.acc);

      for (var i = 0; i < keySpec.num; ++i) {
        var line = notes[i];
        acc_list.push({glyphCode: code, line: line});
      }
    }
  }

  return acc_list;
};

Vex.Flow.keySignature.keySpecs = keySpecsBackup;

Vex.Flow.keySignature.accidentalList = function(acc) {
  if (acc == ""b"") {
    return [2, 0.5, 2.5, 1, 3, 1.5, 3.5];

    return [0, 1.5, -0.5, 1, 2.5, 0.5, 2]; }

The repeat begin barline should properly offset in front of the other stave modifiers. In addition, offset `REPEAT_BEGIN` barline types should automatically draw a `SINGLE_LEFT` barline. This is how the code was structured before the bug was introduced. I also had to alter the `getNoteStartX` to give more padding for a `REPEAT_BEGIN` barline, or else the notes and barline overlapped.

**Functionality Added:**
The `BOLD_DOUBLE_LEFT` stave connector can now be offset in order to align with offset `REPEAT_BEGIN` barlines

I extracted a method from `Stave.draw()` called `getRepeatBeginXShift()`, that way you can access the barline offset for the stave at any time.

I added a property called `x_shift` to the `StaveConnector` object which can be set via a new `setXShift()` method.

Combine the two like so: `connector.setXShift(stave.getRepeatBeginXShift())` in order to align the Bold Double barline with the repeat begin position. Currently `x_shift` is only applied to the x position of the `BOLD_DOUBLE_LEFT` connector and no others.

The caveat with this implementation is that the clef glyphs do not have uniform widths, so there is a little overlap weirdness if widths don't match up precisely. 

Stave Connector tests have been expanded. And the current Repeat tests should now be rendering correctly.

As a result, some of the beaming decisions made by the software make the music unreadable.

There are (at least) 4 main issues as far as I can see which are outlined below in very generalised rules. (I have previously submitted some of these as issues)

1) Time signature awareness

At the very minimum, with time signatures whose top number is divisible by 3, and whose bottom number is <= 8th note, beaming should be in groups of 3 or multiples of 3. Binary time signatures (ie: with numerators 2, 4, 8 etc.) should be grouped in 2's or multiples of 2.

It would be helpful if with odd time signatures (with prime number in the numerator, such as 5/16, 7/8, 11/8 etc.) there was a mechanism for deciding how to group the <=8th notes - ie: 3+2+2, 2+3+3 etc.)

2) Respect for beat boundaries

The example below may be a bug, rather than something that hasn't been implemented, but the 1st semiquaver has been orphaned, and Vexflow then proceeds to beam in groups of 4 across the beat boundary.:

![example1](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/4353219/553523/9e1daca8-c388-11e2-9944-b67d7d7b686e.jpg)

3) Grouping of semiquavers

Where you have a group of 3 semiquavers and a rest, Vexflow removes the beaming as in:

![example3](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/4353219/553535/e4140ec8-c388-11e2-9ed2-6961faffd7c5.jpg)

4) Beaming of triplets:

Triplets should always be beamed separately to avoid:

They are:

1) Inserting a 16th note(s) after a quarter note triplet - the beaming starts on the second 16th note, leaving the first one an orphan and upsetting the relationship with the (quarter note) beat.

(In our vexflow code, inserting a 16th note after a crotchet triplet causes a runtime error)

This can be reproduced with:

tabstave notation=true tablature=false time=4/4 key=Ab tuning=eb
notes :q 5/5 5/4 5/3 ^3^ :16 5/5 5/5 6/5 7/5 6/5

2) Creating two 16th note triplets, one after the other, causes the first to have a 3 over it (correct) but the second to be bracketed 3¬ which doesn't look right. 

tabstave notation=true tablature=false time=4/4 key=Ab tuning=eb

One would expect either:
a) both to have a simple 3 above them
b) or better, for the beaming to be in 2 sets of 3 notes, (ie: 2 separate 16th note triplets) with a 3 above each of the triplets. Inserting ^6^ after the second set, is a workaround, but not what one wants always:

tabstave notation=true tablature=false time=4/4 key=Ab tuning=eb

First of all congratulations for the great library you're developing. It's getting quite impressive.
I used to check it some monthes ago and I didn't have so many features as I see today, so I decided to create something by myself for a custom guitar editor i'm developing.
You can see it working in the following link:
http://kile.stravaganza.org/lab/js/guitartab
Basically you Add Tabs sections and using the mouse or the cursors you move around the tab lines and press which fret you want to play. You can use the shortcuts 'h', 's', 'v',.. for hammers, slides, vibrato.. etc.

The idea of this webapp is to allow flamenco guitarrist with low level of musical score theory to write down their songs instead of using simply textbased tabs.

Flamenco has also some special techniques like for example hitting the wood so I needed these special symbols too.

After checking your new advances I'm thinking about give a try and create a little parser for my data to vexflow syntax. 
Could you recommend me how to make it, I mean, as I'm not going to edit note but frets numbers I don't know if could be a good idea to create each note like a quarternote and each space a quarternote silencce... 
Also when I tried to use vextab format I found some problems while trying to create simple transcriptions with modifiers like for example something simple like:
--0------
--2------
--2-h-3-
--2-------
--0-------
---------.

Should I use the vextab format? Or directly the vexflow syntax?

Sorry for the loooooooooong post :)

You can see a picture here: http://i.imgur.com/aLGkm.png

The code to replicate it is below.

``` javascript
var canvas   = $(""#canvas"")[0];
var renderer = new Vex.Flow.Renderer(canvas, Vex.Flow.Renderer.Backends.CANVAS);
var ctx      = renderer.getContext();
var stave    = new Vex.Flow.Stave(0,0, 200)

stave.setContext(ctx).draw();

var notes = [
    new Vex.Flow.StaveNote({keys: [""A/4""], duration: ""q""}),
    new Vex.Flow.StaveNote({keys: [""A/4""], duration: ""64""}),
    new Vex.Flow.StaveNote({keys: [""A/4""], duration: ""64""})
    ]

Vex.Flow.Formatter.FormatAndDraw(ctx, stave, notes);
```

Basically, it seems that `Vex.RERR(""NoRoomForNotes"")` doesn't get thrown.

I tried to track down the source of the bug and it looks like in the `Vex.Flow.Formatter.preFormat` function the `minTotalWidth` is based on a sum total of all the widths of the notes, but doesn't take into account the whitespace of the `tickContext` So the minTotalWidth is inaccurate to what is actually needed to fit all the notes.

There seems to be two paths:

Either:
- We simply fix this to throw Vex.RERR(""NoRoomForNotes"")
- OR We adjust the formatter to shorten the whitespace of previous high duration tickContexts to allow for more short duration tickContexts in a `Stave` with a small width.

Not sure what the actual intention of the API is here.

some notes here - its not thoroughly tested and completed in anyways, so feel free to comment, but it should be able do basic operations. 

The class is also not immutable. this is to prevent tons of unwanted fraction objects from being created and GC-ed.

_Usage_

```
var fractionA = new Vex.Flow.Fraction(1, 2);
var fractionB = new Vex.Flow.Fraction(3, 4);
var total = new Vex.Flow.Fraction();
```

the normal operations

```
total.add(fractionA, fractionB);
total.subtract(fractionA, fractionB);
total.multiply(fractionA, fractionB);
total.divide(fractionA, fractionB);
```

other operations

```
total.value(); // returns a float representation
total.simplify(); // reduce to its simplest form
total.clone(); // create a new fraction class with its value
total.copy(fractionA); // copies value of fractionA into itself
total.toString(); // string representation
```

utils methods

```
fract.gcd();
fract.lcm();
```

updated

```
total.parse(str); // parse a fraction
total.fraction(); // trancat to its fractional component
total.toSimplifiedString(); // returns a simplified string representation
total.toMixedString(); // returns a simplified mixed form string representation
total.abs(); // turns itself positive

Please tell me if there is anything that still needs to be changed.

Here's the full explanation for all changes:

This pull request contains changes to the way note durations are expressed to make it easier to dynamically generate notes and to express an arbitrary number of dots for the duration in conjunction with note type, which can be regular note, rest, harmonic or muted note.

To preserve backwards-compatibility there are two ways to express note duration:

1: The extended old way: The code parses durations in format [base-duration][dots][type], such as ""8dddr"", ""2dm"". There can be an arbitrary number of dots in the duration. Also, numbers 1, 2 and 4 can be used for durations w, h and q, to make the API more consistent. The old identifiers are still supported as aliases.

NOTE: I removed alias ""b"" for 32nd note, because I couldn't see that alias being used anywhere, but that broke one of the VexTab tests. I couldn't find the code that generates ""b"" as note duration:

```
VexTab Parser module: Notation Only Test (2, 1, 3)
1. tabstave notation and tablature
2. Died on test #2: Invalid note initialization object: ""b""
```

2: The new way:

StaveNote, GhostNote and TabNote use the following properties in the object passed as a parameter to the class constructor:

```
{
  duration: ""2"", // duration is still a string to keep it extensible
  dots: 3,
  type: ""r""
}
```

Where duration is one of: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 or 64.
Where type can be one of ""n"" (default for regular note), ""r"" (rest), ""h"" (harmonic) or ""m"" (muted).
Parameters dots and type are optional.

To fully support the new API for note duration, GhostNote constructor now accepts both a string or an object containing the properties described above.

I added tests for both the old and new API.

I also fixed a small bug, where line_shift for tenor clef was incorrect (zero).

Since I couldn't find any tests for that, I refactored StaveNote draw tests, so that the same tests are run for all four clefs: treble, alto, tenor and bass.

In addition, I added separate tests for harmonic and muted note types.

The chord will consist of two StaveNotes - one for treble clef, and one for bass clef - and within each StaveNote is two keys (I'm basically showing a piano voicing for a Jazz chord).

I'm using a ModifierContext in attempting to get all four keys to line up properly, regardless of which keys have accidentals, in either of the two StaveNotes. Ideally I'd like for all four keys to share the same stem too, but really I just want to get them lined up.

In tracing through the code I found that Vex.Flow.ModifierContext.prototype.formatNotes is what attempts to set x_shifts on notes to get them to line up. The conditional that ultimately decides whether to set the x_shift at all is:

``` javascript
if (top_keys[0].line <= (bottom_keys[bottom_keys.length - 1].line + 0.5)) {
```
## There are two problems with this:
### Assuming First Key

It's only considering the first key in each StaveNote, which may not make sense. It sounds like you really want the minimum or maximum line value for all keys within a StaveNote, no? I guess as long as the keys are ordered properly it doesn't necessary matter, since it's assuming the first and last respectively. There's even a TODO comment above it that seems to suggest this:

``` javascript
// XXX: Do this right (by key, not whole note).
```
### Assuming Same Clef

The comparison of the line value makes sense _within_ a given clef, but not across clefs. So in my case it's looking at a top_note in treble clef and a bottom_note in bass clef, yet their ""line"" values are only really specific to that particular clef.  So my case is failing the conditional even though in reality it should be passing and setting setting that x shift on the bottom note. It sounds like we really should be comparing line values based off some sort of clef line offset.

Once I get some time and can dig more into VexFlow (and get a local development environment set up) I might try to fix this myself, but in case it's a fairly easy fix for any of the core developers I'm reporting it here. I think a fix here would do a lot to solve formatting issues with chords spanning clefs, with multiple keys each.

When I created the tests, the second triad with the accidentals seems to be stealing space from the 3rd triad as opposed to stealing the space between the 1st and 2nd triads (see example link below). This is true with or without the strokes (stave 1 versus stave 2). 

I believe the second triad should be stealing the space between stave 1 and stave2 so all triads are spaced basically the same. In this case the space between triad 1 and triad 2 will be greater, but not that much. Is the current spacing between triads the desired approach for VexFlow?

It's still more of a preliminary pull request; I'm sending it more to get feedback than in expectation of it getting merged right away. 

What this commit allows you to do:
- Render tuplets, either with beamed or unbeamed notes
- Set the number of beats that the tuplet is meant to occupy
- Optionally display the tuplet as a ratio, e.g. as ""3:2"" as opposed to just ""3"" for a standard triplet in 4/4.
- Optionally display the tuplet notation on the top or bottom of the staff

Anyways, a few remaining issues:

I believe that the text for the tuplet is technically meant to be in italics. Unfortunately, I don't think there is an italics Gonville font, so the options are either to forget about the italics or use a font that doesn't match the numbers in the time signature. If anyone has any better ideas, or if I'm wrong, let me know!

I had to make a couple design decisions here that I'm still not 100% convinced of. The main one has to do with the coupling of beams and tuplets. The way I have it implemented now, the tuplet sort of ""owns"" the beam. That is, if you create a tuplet, on of the options you can specify is whether or not it is beamed. If it is, then a beam is automatically rendered when the tuplet is rendered. If the beam and the tuplet were separated, then the tuplet class would need to figure out whether or not its constituent notes were beamed in order to now whether or not to render the bracket, but this might be better overall. If anyone has any opinions feel free to offer them.

Again, this is just for rendering tuplets. They still need to be incorporated with vextab/tabdiv, which will require some extra work and design decisions, such as how one will go about denoting a tuplet in a tabdiv.

I just started using your VexFlow library and I am loving it.  It is a great piece of work.

For my requirements it would be nice to have annotations under the stave, so I have added that feature.  If you look at the test that I have added, you can see when this might be handy.

I hope you can use this feature in the main VexFlow branch.  If you have any suggestions for me to fit your coding standard more closely, I will be happy to make the changes and submit to you again.

This problem can be avoided in most cases by using the complementary accent from the other note (for example, A-flat instead of G-sharp) if there are uses of that natural note within the measure.  That also tends to make for more readable music.

There's a lot more than you'd ever want to know about this stuff at this article: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accidental_(music)

However, TabDiv is not processing the input in IE because it is formatted differently than in Firefox.  I think this is due to the use of the jQuery .text() function before .spit() is called.  jQuery's API states ""Due to variations in the HTML parsers in different browsers, the text returned may vary in newlines and other white space.""  Therefore, I don't think b=b.split(""\n""); is correctly parsing in IE.  One solution may be to parse based on another input, but I'm not skilled enough to modify this code.

Currently, vextab doesn't support user-requested beaming.  According to the jison, it should be allowed, eg:

```
tabstave notation=true tablature=false
notes [ :32 3/4 4/5 ] :q 5/6
```

Should produce something like beamed 32nd notes, followed by a quarter.  The jison (https://github.com/0xfe/vextab/blob/master/src/vextab.jison#L232) refers to commands ""open_beam"" and ""close_beam"", but those aren't implemented in artist.coffee, and are ignored.

This wip PR changes the ""if/else"" to ""switch/case"" for executing commands, which fails when the user adds `[ ... ]` in vextab.  I then implemented a bare-bone idea for keeping track of the beam groups, but it currently doesn't work, as the beams are rendered in addition to the existing note stems:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1637133/115806271-4eaab200-a39b-11eb-9f67-5880645d2de8.png)

I tried a few things like this:

```
    if @in_beam
      @beam_notes.push stave_note
    else
      stave_notes.push stave_note
```

but that didn't work (fails with `Note needs a TickContext assigned for an X-Value`)

Hopefully someone can point out what's wrong with this primitive idea, and then beaming can be properly implemented (that is, if it's needed!).

This PR fixes a bar misalignment mentioned in https://github.com/0xfe/vextab/issues/99, and PR https://github.com/0xfe/vextab/pull/120.  Prior to this PR, this works (bars aligned)

```

I've been working with vextab for a short while and wondered if you'd consider variations/extensions on the existing grammar, if it increases the clarity/utility of vextab.  

For example, the notation below

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1637133/114809593-5052f500-9d5f-11eb-990b-923fdad88c41.png)

notes :8 6/4 $.fingering/1:l:f:2.$ h7/4 $.fingering/1:l:f:3.$ :q 0/2 $.fingering/1:r:f:3.$ $.a>/top.$
```

I've only briefly looked at the jison, but believe that it should be possible to extend the grammar to handle some common (?) things in a simplified manner that would render the same results as above, maybe something like:

```
tabstave notation=true fingering=left accents=top
notes :8 6/4[f2] h7/4[f3] :q 0/2[f3:r, >]
```

It's totally a nice-to-have for me at this point, but if you think it would be a good addition, I could take a look into it.  I'd prefer to contribute back here rather than fork.

I did note that the TAB section doesn't render correctly when the score is complicated, is that why this hasn't been documented yet?

More a question than an issue. It seems that it's not possible to render a triplet containing one quarter note and one 8th note (like [this](https://www.dropbox.com/s/adpytdzia3vu7qu/triplet.jpg?dl=0)). The parser seems to always need 3 notes to create a triplet. 

My questions:

1. Is it actually impossible or did I miss something ? 

2. If it's not possible, is it on purpose and if so, what is the reason ? I know I can create an equivalent triplet by replacing the quarter note by two tied 8th notes, but creating a triplet with one quarter and one 8th seems perfectly valid to me.

As said on Wikipedia: ""The triplet indication may also apply to notes of different values, for example a quarter note followed by one eighth note, in which case the quarter note may be regarded as two triplet eighths tied together (Gherkens 1921, 19).""

If you can provide some brief guidelines where to begin solving these limitations, please do so and I try to solve them.

It seems there's a subtle bug, or maybe I'm doing something wrong. If a tie is preceded by a triplet, then the tie doesn't illustrate in the clef (just in the tabstave).

Here's an example of the vextab I'm using, with the triplet (and no ties to the B in stave 3 and 4)

```
    options stave-distance=30 space=10 player=true

```

And here's the rendered output:

![Triplet, no tie](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/169446/Screen%20Shot%202014-12-12%20at%2012.58.11.png)

Here's one without the triplet, the tie renders correctly (but the bars don't, because the count is wrong, as expected)

```
    options stave-distance=30 space=10 player=true

I made some minor changes to your library. First of all I fixed an issue with the naming of the parser exported by vextab.coffee, that was causing the `vextab_parser is undefined` as mentioned in issue #49 and also was failing all the tests.  
I also switched the `sh` command in the Rakefile, migrating to the backquote command. This was causing an issue when running the rake tasks in a ZSH shell, using rbenv (the wrong ruby was called).  
I removed therubyracer from the Gemfile, and added libv8 instead. therubyracer has some issues right now with OsX Yosemite.  

Thanks for your great work.

Use DocPad for build process.
For each conversion type (coffee -> js) you need a docpad plugin (npm module) and define it via the extension, for instance: **script.js.coffee**

the deploy stuff (scp and ssh) is a shell script now: **deploy.sh**

I'd like to add support for parsing 'lines' as a tabstave option in the vextab artist. 
e.g.

```
tabstave lines=5
```

I've added an additional key to the opts object (although, do note that these are properties of Staves rather than TabStaves).

```
890   addStave: (options) ->
891     opts =
892       tuning: ""standard""
893       clef: ""treble""
894       key: ""C""
895       notation: ""false""
896       tablature: ""true""
897       lines: 6
```

I confirmed in the playground that passing options to the TabStave constructor like so _does_ work (but would pass opts.lines in practice):

```
918     if opts.tablature is ""true""
919       tab_stave = new Vex.Flow.TabStave(@x, @last_y, @customizations.width -20, num_lines: 5)
```

I'm having a bit of trouble understanding how to add the grammar for this however. Does there need to be a change to the jison grammar to accommodate this? Adding a lines option to tabstave results in:

```
Sucky VexTab: Invalid option 'lines' in line 1 column 9
```

I'll persist with trying to figure it out, but if you could point me in the right direction I'd appreciate it! :smile:

My fuzzer found a testcase that causes a NULL Pointer Dereference when using the ""-s"" parameter.

The file content (encoded in base64) that crashes the program is the following:
UDIjTAo2CTM2CTMK

The program output under Valgrind is the following:

```
Error in pixReadStreamPnm: read abend
Error in pixThresholdToBinary: pixs must be 4 or 8 bpp
Error in pixClone: pixs not defined
Error in jbAddPage: pixs not defined or not 1 bpp
==58840== Invalid read of size 4
==58840==    at 0x10EF52: jbig2_add_page(jbig2ctx*, Pix*) (jbig2enc.cc:505)
==58840==    by 0x10CC7D: main (jbig2.cc:472)
==58840==  Address 0x0 is not stack'd, malloc'd or (recently) free'd
```

Although the crash point is the same as https://github.com/agl/jbig2enc/issues/61 it seems a different issue.

The concatenation of the first 3 errors in libleptonica causes pixCLone to return NULL and so
the variable bw is null when jbAddPage is called (that, in fact, print an error).

```
Breakpoint 1, jbig2_add_page (ctx=0x555555936c20, input=<optimized out>) at jbig2enc.cc:504
504	in jbig2enc.cc
(gdb) p bw
$4 = (PIX *) 0x0
```

So the crash is at line 505 (`  ctx->page_width.push_back(bw->w);`) cause `bw->w` is a NULL dereference.

As you can see in the snippet the problem is that you trust the returned value of pixClone assuming that pixClone returns without errors. A possible fix is a check against NULL.

```c
void
jbig2_add_page(struct jbig2ctx *ctx, struct Pix *input) {
  PIX *bw;

  if (false /*ctx->xres >= 300*/) {
    bw = remove_flyspecks(input, (int) (0.0084*ctx->xres));
  } else {
    bw = pixClone(input);
  }

  if (ctx->refinement) {
    ctx->baseindexes.push_back(ctx->classer->baseindex);
  }

  jbAddPage(ctx->classer, bw);
  ctx->page_width.push_back(bw->w);
```

at first, thank you for the nice encoder project. I hope this is the right place for my bugreport.

While working with the lib I detect a memory leak in jbig2enc.cc at line 324 / 325 (function unite_templates_with_indexes). This function removes equivalent pix values and in line 324 the refcount of the deleted image is added to the reference counter of the remaining one:

pixChangeRefcount(
ctx->classer->pixat->pix[firstTemplateIndex],                   pixGetRefcount(ctx->classer->pixat->pix[second_template_index]));

This is unnecessary because the references on the deleted image are not changed. So the reference counter of the remaining image is to high and the image is finally not deallocated.

Regards,
Sebastian

I thought that the program treated the files as images and does not operate on characters. But it does. I use Ubuntu 11.04, jbig2enc was complied from source downloaded in the autumn of 2011. I use the following command for conversion:

jbig2 -b J -d -p -s *.jpg; pdf.py J > JBIG2.pdf

I haven't noticed any problems with texts in English, but when I do conversion of images, containing texts in cyrillic, it gives problems with Serif fonts, especially with Times New Roman. A picture is worth a thousand words, that is why I provide a link to a file containing 1) the original pdf file 2) the jpg file used as a source 3) the final pdf file, produced with jbig2enc. I include three such sets - for documents with Times New Roman, Liberation Serif, and Arial.

There are no problems for documents with Arial fonts. Liberation Serif leads to some character substitutions (see and compare word 1 on row 6 in the original and jbig2 encoded file). With Times New Roman character substitution is almost on every row (for an example see word 3 on row 1).

The files are here:

jbig2 currently doesn't preserve the original resolution of the processed images and always sets both xres and xres to zero. There is already is issue for this problem (#8), but it is closed without an apparent reason.  Nevertheless the problem is serious, because dpi is necessary to properly calculate PDF media box. So I propose a patch which fixes the problem for multipage compression.

I propose a patch which changes jbig2 behavior at two aspects. First, the files generated in the ""-p"" mode now retain their original names, and just the extension is changed (I use "".jbig2"", but whatever else would be OK). A numerical suffix is added in case of name clashes (or for images which go from multipage tiff files). For this reason the 'basename' parameter is gone. The reason for this change is that source images may have some accompanying files (such as background images previously separated with a scan processing application). In such case file names contain some useful information which should not be lost during the processing/conversion.

The second change allows to generate more than just one symbol dictionary, so that the loading speed for large PDF files can be increased. There is now a new option (-P, --pages-per-dict), which specifies how many pages should be processed at the same pass. The default value for this parameter is 15.

I also propose a modified version of pdf.py, implementing support for background images, which can be combined with the foreground mask in the same pdf file. Several graphical formats (PNG, TIFF, JPEG) are supported. It is possible either to use graphics stripped by jbig2 at the previous stage, or prepage images separately in a different application, given that the file names follow the same convention.

BTW it might be reasonable to rename pdf.py to something more meaningful, so that the script could be safely installed somewhere into the PATH.

I'd like to make a compiled version of this available for download on our XMPP server but the following issues are preventing the release. Although it may be a specific use-case, I am sure it is not unique.
1. portable by default. does not save to ~/.xmpp-client or /tmp/xmpp-client-debug.log
2. easy to create/login to one specific server (our server, but that should be able to be modified to fit _anybodys_ needs) for example: just type a nickname and it appends @example.com (or whoever builds the particular binary) This allows AIM functionality, super easy.
3. once configured properly, ""just works"". meaning, you run ./xmpp-client and it connects and displays your online buddies.
## About the CLI flags

Would be nice:

``` bash
./xmmp-client -c config.json -new # this registers new account based on config (if not empty config.json)
./xmpp-client -c config.json # this logs in to existing
./xmpp-client -new # this starts enrollment, asks where to save the about-to-be-created config file

(and probably others) there is no indication of what is excepted as a yes or a no. I defaulted to `""y""`, which is usually the safest bet. However, only `""yes""` is accepted as the affirmative and everything else is assumed to be a no.

My preference would be to accept `""y""`, `""yes""`, and `""Yes""` as affirmative and `""n""`, `""no""`, and `""No""` as negative. Everything else would cause the program to reply `""not understood""` and present the prompt again. You could also add `""(yes/no)""` to the end of the prompt.

- Allow rw for /dev/null, which is used as stdin/out/err for the configured NotificationCommand.
- Add include for local apparmor override file, where rules for the notification command binary can be added by the local administrator without touching the included profile for xmpp-client itself.

**Remarks:**

The local include could also point to a more default location (for most distros, this would probably be `<local/usr.bin.xmpp-client>`), but since the included apparmor profile is not named `usr.bin.xmpp-client` at the moment, this might be left to downstream distributors.
If desired, I could write a paragraph for the README describing how to setup the apparmor profile with enabled NotificationCommand. I tested the updated profile with a custom local override file for my NotificationCommand using debian sid and did not experience any problems.

I think Riseup did some change in their server recently because xmpp-client stopped to work with it.
It's failing to authenticate.

Authentication log:

On `getFeatures`, this is the established stream:
xml.StartElement{Name:xml.Name{Space:""http://etherx.jabber.org/streams"", Local:""stream""}, Attr:[]xml.Attr{xml.Attr{Name:xml.Name{Space:""xmlns"", Local:""db""}, Value:""jabber:server:dialback""}, xml.Attr{Name:xml.Name{Space:""xmlns"", Local:""stream""}, Value:""http://etherx.jabber.org/streams""}, xml.Attr{Name:xml.Name{Space:"""", Local:""version""}, Value:""1.0""}, xml.Attr{Name:xml.Name{Space:"""", Local:""from""}, Value:""riseup.net""}, xml.Attr{Name:xml.Name{Space:"""", Local:""id""}, Value:""b674106a-4f5f-46e1-a276-d5eefdc8d5e1""}, xml.Attr{Name:xml.Name{Space:"""", Local:""to""}, Value:""""}, xml.Attr{Name:xml.Name{Space:""http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace"", Local:""lang""}, Value:""en""}, xml.Attr{Name:xml.Name{Space:"""", Local:""xmlns""}, **Value:""jabber:server""**}}} 

And it's returning empty features.

I also use Gmail with xmpp-client (its working fine), looking their log the stream have a particular different `Value`. Their are returning `""jabber:client""` instead of `""jabber:server""` as Riseup did. 

I tried to force the authentication by plain skipping the `if !havePlain` but looks like their are not accepting it:

  - Require forward secrecy
  - Do not use RC4
  - Does still send `TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV`

Personally, I'm terrified, after some messages leaked, unencrypted, to a contact I wasn't currently speaking to (near identical JIDs plus janky TAB key, #FTL) to turn off `""Always Encrypt"": true`. @leif's patch helps significantly to be sure that I'm speaking to the correct person, and I'd be more comfortable disabling `""Always Encrypt""` if I were always kept informed of the current OTR state of the current conversation.

I apologise for dumping completely unsolicited patches on you. If this feature isn't desired, you should feel free to close this issue, and I am happy to just keep these patches as my own thing.

All later OTR sessions produce a similar error (with bigger keyid on the xmpp-client side).

The OTRv2 spec says:

My interpretation would be that Gibberbot is right and we should start a second AKE with `theirKeyId` and `myKeyId=2`. On the other hand, I don't have any problems in sessions with the somewhat authoritative Pidgin-OTR and other clients, so I wonder if this is really the intended interpretation.

I am not necessarily asking for a patch here; if somebody more knowledgeable about OTR could indicate how this should be fixed, I could probably do it myself.

Another open issue points out that it's a problem with the version of go that comes in the default packages. You need 1.1 or higher.

There are obviously other ways to get 1.1 or higher, but I did it by building go from source.

Well anyway, here's all of the steps I followed to get xmpp-client working. I hope someone else finds them helpful too.

$ cd /usr/lib
$ hg clone -u release https://code.google.com/p/go
$ cd go/src
$ ./all.bash
$ cd ~
$ mkdir go
$ cd go
$ vi golangenv.sh
paste this into the file and save:
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin
export GOPATH=$HOME/go
export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin
$ chmod +x golangenv.sh
$ source golangenv.sh
$ go get github.com/agl/xmpp-client
$ xmpp-client

Then to run in the future, just:
$ cd ~/go
$ source golangenv.sh
$ xmpp-client

You can also put the environment variables in ~/.pam_environment and then logout and relogin, but I'm finding it a little annoying to keep track of all the environment variables golang projects need, so I'm just using a small script instead.

It's really only important to me that I can build Pond in Debian, I just tried Fedora to see if I could reproduce the issue. If you like, I can try building Pond by install Go from source in Debian and/or I can verify the tags on the source. It seems like everything is getting there fine, but I have yet to verify the git tags. Too tired right now.

```
cmd := exec.Command(""vim"", ""-n"", ""--cmd"", ""set modelines=0"", ""-c"", ""set viminfo="", ""+4"", ""--"", tempFileName)
```

I think we might want to consider adding the following options (`-n` does `noswapfile` but isn't as readable):

```
-c 'set nobackup'
-c 'set noswapfile'
-c 'set nowritebackup'
```

We may also want to set `-N`:

```
       -N          No-compatible mode.  Reset the 'compatible'  option.   This
                   will  make Vim behave a bit better, but less Vi compatible,
                   even though a .vimrc file does not exist.
```

We should probably not load plugins by using the `--noplugin` option:

```
       --noplugin  Skip loading plugins.  Implied by -u NONE.
```

For the console version, we might want to consider the `-X` option:

```
       -X          Don't connect to the X server.  Shortens startup time in  a
                   terminal,  but  the  window title and clipboard will not be
                   used.
```

Once we sandbox, we may want to consider this option:

```
       -m          Modifying  files  is  disabled.  Resets the 'write' option.
                   You can still modify the buffer, but writing a file is  not

For Pond the only way to do this currently is to put ascii armored PGP inside pond messages. This has a couple downsides: it's a pain to use (e.g. requires unusual procedures from your pond counter parties),  it roughly halves the channel capacity, and it blows forward secrecy if you leave the storage you used to shuttle information across the airgap where it can be discovered; if you're at all careless with the pgp it can also break deniability.

Of course, one can compromise the airgap and make only the tor connection to the pond server work; but it's somewhat hard to be sure you got this right.

It would be nice if I could run a headless pond polling daemon that polled for data and dropped it into a directory that I could shuttle across the airgap UUCP style-- but which didn't have access to the ephemeral keys needed to decrypt messages.  This might also improve traffic analysis immunity, since the headless polling might have a reduced uptime signature than a GUI-enabled client with an enduser sitting at it.

This triggered a TPM timeout which is ongoing (currently for approximately 4h), at least with regards to that particular state file. I can't tell if the state file is corrupted and as far as I remember never set any password on my TPM and have been unable to reset the timeout on the TPM itself. (Plus I'm not sure what happens to my state file if I do that anyway.)

Here's the exact error:

> > > tpm: layer: tpm, code: 0x803: TPM is defending against dictionary attacks and is in some time-out period

Is this a TPM issue or is there something I can do to unstick the state file? I moved the old state file aside and was able to create a new pond account, but I don't fully understand the interplay between all of Pond, the TPM, and trousers. I'll be happy to refile the bug elsewhere if this isn't actually a Pond bug. Thanks.

Edit: Also, definitely Pond-relevant: is there any way to import an old state file on the same machine with the same TPM? Edit 2: This is on Debian unstable.

If the user wishes to send the same message to multiple recipients, the user would select the first contact, compose, draft and send to the first recipient.
Once in the outbox for that message, the user can type ""forward (bob)"" and that will take the user back to the draft stage, with exact the same message, but for a the new contact, bob. From there the user can send, and repeat the process for all of the intended recipients.

```
> cp $GOPATH/bin/client /home/amnesia/Persistent/pond
> unset GOPATH
> rm -rf $GOPATH
> /home/amnesia/Persistent/pond
```

and then forget about Go until one wants to update Pond. The C libraries are not statically linked, but they don't need $GOPATH either.

Would it be okay to remove RUNNING and mention this in doc/index.html instead?

**Edit:** Fix path in the last command.

Messages can be sent to multiple recipients.  By default, recipients are not told other recipients exist, like BCC in email.  Optionally, recipients may be marked as to ""introduce"", which tells other recipients about them and tells them about all the other recipients.  In particular, an introduced recipient and any other recipients see a ""greet"" button which allows them to initiate a PANDA key exchange.

As noted in https://github.com/agl/pond/pull/144 introduction functionality creates a vector to socially engineer an MITM attack.  We therefore provide three new records introducedBy, verifiedBy, and introducedTo to record your local social graph, as visible from messages containing introductions.  In theory, these would help contacts discover such socially engineering attacks.  Users may disable collecting these records.

Our short-term TODO list : 
- Add sending to multiple recipients to the CLI and make introductions in the CLI use it. @rvedam 
- Expose GTK's information dialog boxes in client/gtk.go @emptyset
- Make dialog boxes that explain anything that needs explaining, like the risks of keeping the social graph data, what to do if an introduction creates a second contact with a similar name, etc.
- Allow CLI users to disable collecting social graph information, like in the GUI
- ~~Rename verifiedBy to reintroducedBy~~.
- Deal with introductions to revoked contacts appropriately
- Remove an introduction's PANDA secret after use prevent using it twice.

Our longer-term TODO list : 
- A new outbox message is created for every recipient in this patch.  Ideally, we should replace queuedMessage.to with toNormal and toIntroduce fields as well, but this requires allowing a message to live in both client.queue and client.outbox simultaneously.  We can make this happen by using the same queuedMessage.id field and leaving the queuedMessage.message pointer nil in one of them, but it's another huge commit. 
- An email style ""reply all"" function makes sense once we've done all that.  We can ""reply all"" to messages containing introductions of course so https://github.com/burdges/pond/commit/cdc1bec458ff19ed88019f92bdf7ffc0c0b3da6e helps as well. 
- Allow users to edit a contact's name when doing an introduction.  Reply all should presumably preserve such names through a message thread, i.e. if I receive a message introducing @ioerror as ioerror who I already know as Jake then if I reply all I should reintroduce him as ioerror, not Jake.  There is a slight downside here that if the original message was an MITM attempt that I didn't catch then I'd create an MITMed ioerror in addition to my real Jake, which I'd continue to propagate.  And nobody else would notice ""Hey Jeff always calls ioerror Jake"".

At 31c3, Dan Bernstein (djb) suggested that Pond should :
- Allow more variations on retained status (2 days after reading, 1 week, 1 month, permanent) 
- Allow message senders to specify the default retained status for a message, although recipients could change that setting naturally. 
- Allow users to sort retained message somehow, ala folders, tags, etc. for email, not sure if senders could ever specify this or if intelligent defaults might apply.
- Allow users to search for a given string their inbox, outbox, folders, tags, etc. 

Implicit in this is imho the ability to backup Pond messages into external archive files that're encrypted as carefully as the state-file but ideally remain viable even if the main state-file is compromised, corrupted, etc. 

I haven't thought about how one should archive messages by topic, maybe some topic tags like gmail.

I'm happy to implement any suggestions.

Ram, Alan, and I originally added the ability for contacts to introduce their contacts to one another by sending each a message containing the other's name and public identity, and proposed PANDA shared secret.  This basic functionality is visible in 9d341e1f3def9a5712aea3da50677322abeab7ab and avoids modifying any .proto files. 

There is a risk that someone could exploit this introduce function to MITM two users whom they introduce to one another simply by giving them different shared secrets.  I therefore added three new records introducedBy, verifiedBy, and introducedTo that record your local social graph as visible from messages containing introductions, which should aid users in exposing any MITM attacks.  These tools are functioning by e7d77e528333c7303a43d487026cad8965406920 but note they require changing client.proto in 1c64ebbb and rebuilding client.pb.go in a4e91a07.  The last commit adds a checkbox to disable keeping this social graph information for users who consider keeping it a security risk. 

There were several rounds of attempts at a GUI rebased into 9d341e1f, some of which are visible in https://github.com/burdges/pond/commits/sendmany  I ultimately decided the best approach to introductions was to just do multiple recipient messages, so now a682b071 mostly blows away our earlier work in 9d341e1f.  

Sending messages to multiple recipients required adding multiple recipients to the Draft struct, so the Draft.to uint64 has been replaced by Draft.toNormal and Draft.toIntroduce []uint64s, which also required adding them to client.proto in b3771354 and rebuilding it in 5016a0a7.

All commits should build and run without crashes except for 1c64ebbb and b3771354 which require their subsequent commits that rebuild client.pb.go.  In particular the mammoth commit 6026acc1 that replaces Draft.to with Draft.toNormal and Draft.toIntroduce postponed modifications to disk/client.proto so that it can be built and tested without the state file changes.  

Our short-term TODO list : 
- ~~Fix usageString() so that it displays a more correct size over estimation.~~ 
- ~~Repair any tests I broke with my GUI changes in composeUI.~~ 
- ~~Write our own tests for the multiple recipient functionality and introductions.~~ 
- Add sending to multiple recipients to the CLI and make introductions in the CLI use it.
- Expose GTK's information dialog boxes in client/gtk.go
- Make dialog boxes that explain anything that needs explaining, like the risks of keeping the social graph data, what to do if an introduction creates a second contact with a similar name, etc.
- Allow CLI users to disable collecting social graph information like e56da9e for the GUI

We'd appreciate feedback on these questions :
- How should introduction messages be encoded?  I'm overly fond of our current format, which is a URI of the form pond-introduce-panda://NAME/SECRET/IDENTITY/  Instead, we could either build introduction messages into the pond.Message proto format, or else choose a more informative URI, like maybe pond-introduce:NAME?pandaSecret=SECRET?identity=IDENTITY 
- I've had a request to allow renaming contacts when doing introductions so that someone can be introduced using a different name than the one used locally. 
- Is an unint64 sufficient information for the social graph data introduceBy, verifiedBy, and introducedTo?  I decided yes by considering the various additional data one might record : dates feel relatively unhelpful for uncovering MITM attacks but excessively helpful to authorities who seize a pond account.  Aliases users were introduced by are useful for spreading information about discovered MITM attacks, well think about the user name ""Fake Alice maybe owned by Eve"", but recording who distributed that name seems bad, so we'd just add a separate Contact.aliases []string field instead.  
- Should verifiedBy really be called verified?  Currently if Eve introduces a fake Alice to Bob and Carol then Bob and Carol see the fake Eve as being verified by each other.  Is another word better? 

Our longer-term TODO list : 
- A new outbox message is created for every recipient in this patch.  Ideally, we should replace queuedMessage.to with toNormal and toIntroduce fields as well, but this requires allowing a message to live in both client.queue and client.outbox simultaneously.  We can make this happen by using the same queuedMessage.id field and leaving the queuedMessage.message pointer nil in one of them, but it's another huge commit like 6026acc1, so I want some feedback on this before proceeding.  
- A reply all function would begin to make sense once we've done all that, but again we should settle on how to encode introductions before doing it.  Reply all require more thought about to whom we send more introductions.

Is it worth implementing a kind of ""fallback"" to RSA?

Thought :  In the state file, we could store an 8192 bit RSA public key pair, and the RSA public keys for every contact.  RSA key exchange would occur by attaching public key requests and/or the public keys themselves to messages.  Pond messages would then carry an RSA signature of the ratchet values and users would be notified if a signature failed for a contact to whom they knew the RSA key.  A user's RSA public key pair would be generated automatically, presumably by using libgcrypt, but conceivably they could import their existing GnuPG key or export the pond generated one for use with GnuPG or SSH.

Advantages : Safer against hick ups in elliptic curve cryptography.  Improves security in the absence of good code review.  Always nice to have a securely distributed GnuPG key lying around. 

Disadvantages : Confuses users.  Adds libgcrypt dependency.  Adds complexity, making full review and other implementations harder.  Cannot create an air gapped GnuPG key which might encourage insecurity through laziness.

What do people feel about this or similar?  I have not succeeded in convincing myself that this would be worth doing, but I wanted to ask publicly for comments.

Error from server pondserver://[redacted]@jb644zapje5dvgk3.onion: error from server: DELIVERY_SIGNATURE_INVALID

This was happening a long time ago in #8 but it was apparently fixed then.

As discussed in #134, it has been happening again to a lot of people lately. It has happened to at least four of my contacts now, three of whom are on the default server. It has also happened to some of @burdges contacts.

When it happens, it affect's all of the person's contacts at once: the server rejects all messages to them. In three of the cases, they can still send messages, but in another case messages from them are delivered but yield a ""Failed to decrypt"" message.

The message shows as normal, I was able to reply and so on.

Pond should probably state which message failed to decrypt - was it ""gcr"" or was it a second message? I think it was the ""gcr"" message and apparently this happened for my previous message to them as well!

Any thoughts? Has anyone else seen this behavior?

for some time we weren't able to install Pond on Ubuntu 14.04. Which is too bad since over the last few months we had some people attending CryptoParties in Berlin and they were very much interested in getting Pond.

Here's what we did (following the installation manual):

We begin with...

> sudo apt-get install golang git libgtk-3-dev libgtkspell3-3-dev libtspi-dev trousers tor mercurial tpm-tools
> cd
> mkdir gopkg
> export GOPATH=$HOME/gopkg

Then try to get the client without any tags...

> go get github.com/agl/pond/client

This results in the following errors.

```

Then we recreated the gopkg folder and tried it with the ubuntu tag.

> rm -rf gopkg
> mkdir gopkg
> go get -tags ubuntu github.com/agl/pond/client

Looking forward to your feedback :smiley: 
- Prequisites on build computer: android sdk, mercurial, git, gcc with working build environment
- Prequisites on Android: root access, enabled USB debugging & root access for adb, Orbot, Terminal Emulator
- Recommended on Android: BusyBox (with bash), Hacker's Keyboard (5-row pc layout used from bash makes vim more usable. You will need to start bash first and pond afterwards)
- All Apps can/should be get from F-Droid official repos.

Remarks:
- I used Arch Linux (x64) for building and CyanogenMod 11 with Android 4.4.4 (ARMv7) for running, but the directions should roughly apply for other architectures/distributions/ROMs/Android versions too.
- Replace $HOME/pond-android with your chosen path.
- For now you will have to copy your distributions ca-certificates.crt to your device, as access to the Android CA store requires Java Keystore code.
- If your Android ROM doesn't feature vim (e.g. stock ROM) or it fails to start (like it is the case for recent CM), you can get it here: http://gdr.geekhood.net/gdrwpl/vim-android.php
  Just extract data/local/bin/vim from the archive and put it on your device as /system/xbin/vim.
- For some devices (mostly HTC & Samsung), it may not be possible to directly write to /system from the booted ROM. Instead you may have to do step 7 from recovery as root.
- Please note that the Pond statefile will be stored in /data/data/jackpal.androidterm/app_HOME/.config/pond or /sdcard/.config/pond. As with every non-TPM version of Pond, secure erasure cannot be guaranteed, so be sure to at least encrypt your Android!

```
1. Choose a working directory under which everything will be downloaded and installed.

% mkdir $HOME/pond-android && cd $HOME/pond-android

2. Get Go source code and build with tests 

% hg clone -u release https://code.google.com/p/go
% cd go/src
% ./all.bash

3. Get cross compilation helper scripts from GitHub.

% git clone git://github.com/davecheney/golang-crosscompile.git
% source golang-crosscompile/crosscompile.bash

4. Add Go binary to your path (if not already done). Be sure to use the same version of Go
you just compiled. This could conflict if you have another version installed manually or
via package managers. Build go cross-compiler for every architecture.

% export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/pond-android/go/bin
% go-crosscompile-build-all

5. Create gopkg folder and set environment variables GOPATH and GOARM
To determine which value for GOARM you need look here:
https://code.google.com/p/go-wiki/wiki/GoArm

% mkdir $HOME/pond-android/gopkg && export GOPATH=$HOME/pond-android/gopkg && export GOARM=7

6. Get current Pond source and dependencies & build for ARM

% go-linux-arm get -tags ""nogui notpm"" github.com/agl/pond/client

7. You will find your binary in $HOME/pond-android/gopkg/bin/linux-arm/.
Copy to device via adb, additionally copy ca-certificates.crt file to avoid error because
of missing root certificates. We will temporarily store the files on /sdcard, moving them
to the appropriate places using the adb shell. You obviously need your device plugged
into USB and have USB debugging allowed with root access for the next steps. You will
also need to create a tmpfs mount here and make it permanent with an init script
(the init script step may vary across android versions and roms!).

% adb push $HOME/pond-android/gopkg/bin/linux-arm/client /sdcard/
% adb push /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt /sdcard/
% adb shell
shell@xxx:/ $ su

8. Start Orbot App and establish a Tor circuit. Afterwards start Terminal Emulator and startup pond! Note that Pond won't work over adb shell.

Note that you will still need to follow step 7 (with your own paths of course) and possibly install vim on your device for Pond to work.

if a contact is currently pending and you received a message from him/her, pond will crash if you try to read that message. The problem is the following code in `showInbox()`:

```
   if len(msg.message.Files) > 0 {
       c.Printf(""%s Attachments (use 'save <#> <filename>' to save):\n"", termHeaderPrefix
   }
```

since `msg.message` is pointing to `0x0` at that point, as noted in the docs of `InboxMessage`:

```
// message may be nil if the contact who sent this is pending. In this
// case, sealed with contain the encrypted message.
message *pond.Message
```

The GUI code guards against this edge case with this code:

```
if isPending {
    body = ""(cannot display message as key exchange is still pending)""
    sentTime = ""(unknown)""
} else {
```

This might be fixable by guarding `showInbox()` and checking for the existense of `msg.message` before displaying any parts of the message.

Thanks for all the code, and enjoy summer!

I might be wrong but I think that two code issues can be combined to crash the pond server.

a) In `server.go:newAccount()` we write `req.Group` to that file, without checking that it's a proper group key (like the `Group()` method does). This is not bad on its own, but it would be more defensive if the key is checked upon insertion to the file.

b) In `server.go:revocation()` we do:
`group := account.Group()
    groupCopy, _ := new(bbssig.Group).Unmarshal(group.Marshal())
    groupCopy.Update(revocation)`
without checking the retval of `Group()` or `Unmarshal()`.  I believe that if a new account is created with a corrupted key, and then a revocation is executed for that account, the `Group()` operation will fail and cause a nil dereference or something in the Unmarshal. If that doens't do it, then the Unmarshal will fail and cause the same in the `Update()`. In any case, servers might crash. Maybe.

I suspect it's crashing because the user I deleted also has a draft. Line
`c.Printf(""   %s : %s (%s%s%s)\n"", terminalEscape(c.contacts[msg.to].name, false), subline, termCliIdStart, msg.cliId.String(), termReset)`
is the culpit here, and specifically `terminalEscape(c.contacts[msg.to].name, false)` throws the nil pointer dereference error. This happens because `msg.to` referes to a user ID that does not exist anymore.

I'm from the hackfest (?).

the server.go:revocation() function does not seem to verify the signature of the revocation message. The protobuf of the SignedRevocation message contains a signature, but I don't see it used in the code.

Fortunately because the 'from' that gets passed to getAccount() is bound to the connection (which is authenticated. specifically it seems to be the final hmac value of the auth handshake (in handshakeServer)) so this doesn't seem to allow to do unauthenticated revocations.

See https://github.com/coruus/pond/commit/d3252f35c636cee954bc79323d43b0a378384607 for a possible solution.

I have explicitly done things backwards from the usual sequence of ops used for atomic file operations; failure at some point in the state-saving process may result in an additional temporary Pond file being present, but it will never result in the new Pond state not being saved (if it is possible).

One other solution would be to open the file O_RW, read the current state, seek to the end of the file, append the current state there, write the new state at the beginning of the file, and then truncate the file to the length of the new state... It's not clear to me that this has much better security properties than what I'm presently doing (aside from leaving no possibility of an additional file that a user may be unaware of). (And it likely requires an fsync, or opening with O_SYNC, to actually be safe on many OSes.)

(Note that the pull request states that it is untested. In the intervening few hours, I have checked that it at least saves and restores state correctly (I think). I haven't had time yet to test the condition under which the bug is seen.)

Should (hopefully) fix an irritating bug that I've encountered (often in VMs), in which Pond attempts to write out its statefile on close, successfully opens it in truncate mode, and then can't write anything to the truncated file because the VHD is out of space.

Am I missing a good library with atomic file operations for Go? (Or maybe even something in the standard library?) In Python, I use some code stolen from Google libraries to do this; this is modeled on that code.

$ go get -v github.com/agl/pond/client

# github.com/agl/pond/panda

```

It would be nice if the go 1.1 features weren't added until the major distros have go 1.1 support. It makes packaging pond, even for private use, difficult.

I think the below lines in the example 02a-allow-all-traffic-to-an-application.md should be corrected.

- [ ] Pods within namespace A can communicate with each other
- [ ] Pods can't communicate across namespaces (ie. Pods in namespace B cannot communicate pods in namespace A)
- [ ] Pods can allow ingress from the internet
- [ ] Pods cannot allow egress to k8s nodes

So far, the closest I've got is 
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: user-a-default-network-policy
  namespace: user-a-ns
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  - Egress
  ingress:
  - from:
    - namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          name: user-a-ns
  egress:
  - to:
    - ipBlock:
        cidr: 0.0.0.0/0
        except:
        - 172.16.35.11/32      # K8s Node IPs
        - 172.16.35.12/32
```

This results namespace isolation and k8s node denials, fulfilling three of the requirements listed:

- [x] Pods within namespace A can communicate with each other
- [x] Pods can't communicate across namespaces (ie. Pods in namespace B cannot communicate pods in namespace A)
- [ ] Pods can allow ingress from the internet
- [x] Pods cannot allow egress to k8s nodes

We did think about adding `spec.ingress.from.ipBlock` as below, but it turns out allowing everything from other namespaces... 

```yaml
  ingress:
  - from:
    - ipBlock:
        cidr: 0.0.0.0/0
    - namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          name: user-a-ns
```

resulting:

- [x] Pods within namespace A can communicate with each other
- [ ] Pods can't communicate across namespaces (ie. Pods in namespace B cannot communicate pods in namespace A)
- [x] Pods can allow ingress from the internet
- [x] Pods cannot allow egress to k8s nodes

I'm really struggling to get all four of the requirements set up. Any help is appreciated.

This is because they control inter-pod traffic and when you expose Pod as Service, ports are remapped like above. Therefore, you need to use the container port numbers (such as 8000 and 5000) in the NetworkPolicy specification. An alternative less error prone is to refer to the port names (such as metrics and http).

I have faced difficulties when applying network policies to my Kubernetes cluster.
My network policy:

```
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: staging
  namespace: staging
spec:
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  podSelector: {}
  ingress:
  - from:
    - namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          staging: net
```

Environment:
I have 3 pods in the namespace called staging, all pods are labeled as staging: net. Let's get for an example one NGINX pod which serve on 80 port, one DB pod pgsql on port 5432 and third pod just to make test from him. Each of pods has a service which exposing a respective port for each pod as a ClusterIP. Before applying network policy traffic working with all namespaces. As fast as I apply network policy it working as expected by denying traffic from other namespaces. In case, when I want to allow traffic from another namespace I'm adding the label ""staging:net"" to this namespace and all working as expected. However, one thing is not working as I have expected to. My exposed services for example named nginx and pgsql unreachable.

Is it possible to make service accessible with such rules or it's expected behavior? I'm a little bit frustrated can't find any information on the internet with same symptoms.

Instead, traffic is allowed from both`default` and  `staging` namespace


Create the following namespace

```
kind: Namespace
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: staging
  annotations:
    net.beta.kubernetes.io/network-policy: |
      {
        ""ingress"": {
          ""isolation"": ""DefaultDeny""
        }
      }
```

Spin up a `busybox` for testing purposes in the default namespace:

    kubectl run busybox --rm -ti --image=busybox /bin/sh  --namespace=default

...and my `ui` service (supposed to be listening on port `80`) in `staging` namespace is reachable!


    / # wget --spider ui.staging.svc.cluster.local
    Connecting to ui.staging.svc.cluster.local (100.68.222.37:80)

I have also tried to just create via command line a namespace (without) `yml` file

and apply the following presumably deny-all policy (didn't work either) which you [suggest](https://github.com/ahmetb/kubernetes-network-policy-recipes/blob/master/04-deny-traffic-from-other-namespaces.md)

```
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  namespace: staging
  name: web-deny-other-namespaces
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector: {}
```


Using `aws`.

As you can see the same element gets two different address allocation.

I personally have some interesting use cases in my work that can be better expressed using the ForEach approach.

This code is another try to implement the @kalaninja idea:
```go
func (q Query) ForEach(c chan interface{}, action func(interface{})) {
	next := q.Iterate()
	if c == nil {
		for item, ok := next(); ok; item, ok = next() {
			action(item)
		}
	} else {
		var wg sync.WaitGroup
		for item, ok := next(); ok; item, ok = next() {
			wg.Add(1)
			go func(wg *sync.WaitGroup, item interface{}) {
				defer wg.Done()
				action(item)
			}(&wg, item)
		}

		go func() {
			wg.Wait()
			close(c)
		}()
	}
}
```

This provides an elegant way to solve the concurrent example problem:
```go
results := make(chan interface{})
domains := []string{""www.google.com"", ""www.github.com"", ""www.facebook.com""}

From(domains).
    Select(func(d interface{}) interface{} {
        return fmt.Sprintf(""http://%s/favicon.ico"", d)
    }).
    ForEach(results, func(url interface{}) {
	  resp, _ := http.Get(url.(string))
	  results <- resp.StatusCode
    })

count := FromChannel(results).CountWith(func(r interface{}) bool {
    return r.(int) == 200
})

fmt.Println(""Count:"", count)
```

Or just for run simple tasks in parallel:
```go
From(domains).
    Select(func(d interface{}) interface{} {
	return fmt.Sprintf(""http://%s/favicon.ico"", d)
    }).
    ForEach(results, func(url interface{}) {
	resp, _ := http.Get(url.(string))
	fmt.Println(url.(string), ""->"", resp.StatusCode)
    })

<-results

fmt.Println(""Finished all tasks"")
```

If no channel was provided, ForEach will iterate sequentially as proposed by @kalaninja.

Perhaps this is slightly out of scope for a context switcher.

but I accidentally made a big blunder and dodged a massive bullet running dangerous commands in prod that was intended to be run against the lab.

Is there any idea's you have or any features you could add that would password protect particular context's or timeout a particular context and then auto switch back to default?


It would save me a ton. I need access to the prod context for some work-related tasks, but as I use ctx as a quick switcher, perhaps there should be a protection/security mechanism for certain contexts (like safety gloves)

Add support for `Rancher CLI` when switch context with `kubectx`.

Current workaround is to use absolute file paths in config file by prefixing all paths with `C:\Users\USERNAME\.kube\`, but that kinda defeats the purpose of having a `.kube` directory :D

I'm happy there is a release for windows. But I think there is a small bug with how the escape sequences for color codes are done.

When I execute `kubens` I get the following output when it tries to tell me which namespace I'm in.

```
[32m✔ [0mActive namespace is XXXX

I've tested this both with the command prompt (CMD) and Powershell and the issue happens in both. It happens everywhere where I would expect colors to be. 

Given the 32 there I think it outputs the escape sequence for green on Linux consoles. But I think on Windows this works slightly differently. Or that the escape character is incorrect or mangled somehow.. If I copy paste these sequences I do see colored text: https://gist.githubusercontent.com/mlocati/fdabcaeb8071d5c75a2d51712db24011/raw/b710612d6320df7e146508094e84b92b34c77d48/win10colors.cmd

However when I run it with kubectl 1.10 it works fine. I've tracked the error down to the command `kubectl get namespaces -o=jsonpath=""{range .items[*].metadata.name}{@}{\""\n\""}{end}""`. If I remove the space between `range` and `.items` like so `kubectl get namespaces -o=jsonpath=""{range.items[*].metadata.name}{@}{\""\n\""}{end}""` kubens is able to get the list of namespaces.

```yaml
users:

Thank you all for bringing this up so many times, clearly I need to change my mind about this, so here are some arguments for/against making this change:

## Arguments ""against""

1. We already highlight current context/namespace when you run these kubectx/kubens with no arguments

1. You can find the current context/namespace through native kubectl commands

    - `kubectl config current-context` (reasonable)
    - `kubectl config view -o=jsonpath=""{.contexts[?(@.name==\""$(kubectl config current-context)\"")].context.namespace}""` (not really)

1. Adding yet another flag will increase the interaction surface. Where do we stop adding new flags? Isn't this already possible via kubectl?

## Arguments ""for""

- I don't want to call a long kubectl command or have a long alias, I just want it all in one place. (👍)

- If I have a lot of clusters or namespaces, running `kubectx` or `kubens` prints output that exceed my terminal height, so I cannot see highlighted item (in yellow font) without scrolling. (👍)

- My script uses kubectx, so I need the current context. (⚠️ kubectx/kubens are not supported for calling from headless scripts, they are designed to be interactive commands). (👎)

## Designs considered (please add more in comments)

1. **Option 1:** Add `-c` flag. It's also in line with the current flags we have (`-d`, `-h`...)
    - This seems intuitive as it's proposed independently by multiple people. (see above)
    - Do we do just `-c`, or also `--current` (I personally prefer just `-c`.)

1. **Option 2:** Add `?` subcommand. It looks nice, and short: `kubectx ?` and looks similar to `kubectx -`, but it is unconventional. It's
    - This is the first option that came to my mind, and also proposed in #62.
    - printing current context is more of a “command” than an “option” , so this fits better.

Bash works fine and has brought us this far. Since we mostly shell out to kubectl for config processing and the project is minimalist enough, this has been working well.

## Problems with using bash

However, for long-term maintenance, using bash scripting will be a problem:

- **Bash is not cross-platform, hence divides the community:** Many users quote they can't use kubectx on windows. So some of them have gone on and wrote their ""clones"" of kubectx that work on Windows. 

  Some examples of fragmentation from the ecosystem:

  - Kubectxwin: https://github.com/thomasliddledba/kubectxwin
  - kubectx-rs (Rust): https://github.com/FGRibreau/kubectx-rs
  - kubectl-ctx (Go, a kubectl plugin): https://github.com/postfinance/kubectl-ctx
  - kubectx (poorly named, Node.js) https://github.com/FGRibreau/kubectx, another one in nodejs: https://github.com/WoLfulus/kubee
  - someone emailed me yesterday asking if they can use ""kubectx"" name and publish a Go implementation
  - Issue to support windows: #29
  - kx (Go, related): https://github.com/kylie-a/kx

  This is pointing to clear community interest for a kubectx that works on windows, despite bash-on-Windows and Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) are now widely available.

- **People don't want contribute to bash scripts:** I like bash alright, most people don't want to code in bash. This is probably dramatically reducing the contributor and maintainer prospects pool drastically.

- **Hard to reason about code:** Some parts of the kubectx code are about to get out of control, such as the flags parsing/handling.

## Problems with switching to Go

- **Rewrite:** We need to rewrite. Arguably the code would be longer, but more maintainable. We already have some integration/CLI tests effort happening in #2, which should help test post-rewrite.

- **Larger binary size:** We're going from 5kb to ~5-10 mb in exchange for platform portability.

- **More difficult to support POSIX platforms:** If you had bash, kubectx would work fine today. But if we rewrite in Go, supporting architectures like ppc or arm (<1% users) , would require making separate Go binary releases. Bash doesn't have this problem.

Proposal to address #5 

My proposal is to check the `return code` of the problematic functions. If any of them return a non-zero, call `exit_err` immediately, print an error message to `stderror` and `exit 1`.

# Testing
Validate that `kubectx` and `kubens` still function. I wasnt able to force `kubectx` and/or `kubens` to fail in the middle of gathering contexts or namespaces so I used this test function to test my concepts:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -o pipefail

exit_err() {    
   echo >&2 ""${1}""        
   exit 1                    
} 

get_contexts() {
  echo -e ""hello\nyay\nworld""
}

# Supposed to fail
get_contexts_fail() {
  echo -e ""hello\nyay\nworld""
  tar -clv | sort -n
}

# Will Succeed 
cons=$(get_contexts) || exit_err ""error on test 1""
for con in $cons; do
  echo $con
done

echo ""finished get context""

# Will Fail
cons=$(get_contexts_fail) || exit_err ""error on test 2""
for con in $cons; do
  echo $con
done
```

Running it to simulate how an error would return from a function like `get_contexts` in `kubectx`:

```bash
~$ bash test.sh
hello
yay
world
finished get context
tar: Cowardly refusing to create an empty archive
Try 'tar --help' or 'tar --usage' for more information.
error on test 2
```

As a kubernetes admin with many clusters within GKE the copy/paste to jump about becomes quite slowing.

For example:
```
gke_beamery-global_us-east4-a_beamery-elk
gke_beamery-global_us-east4-a_beamery-secrets
gke_beamery-pre-production_us-central1-a_beamery-foundation
gke_beamery-pre-production_us-central1-a_beamery-preproduction
gke_beamery-pre-production_us-central1-a_beamery-services
gke_beamery-preview_us-central1-a_beamery-foundation
gke_beamery-preview_us-central1-a_beamery-ingestion
gke_beamery-preview_us-central1-a_beamery-preview-cluster
gke_beamery-preview_us-central1-a_beamery-services
gke_beamery-preview_us-central1-a_build
gke_beamery-production_us-east4-a_beamery-foundation
gke_beamery-production_us-east4-a_beamery-production
gke_beamery-production_us-east4-a_beamery-service-cluster
minikube
```

When not jumping forward or backward, it involves a copy paste command every selection.

**Proposal**

Addition of an ordinal in the list context to then allow set_context with the ordinal.

Example:

```
0: gke_beamery-global_us-east4-a_beamery-elk
1: gke_beamery-global_us-east4-a_beamery-secrets
2: gke_beamery-pre-production_us-central1-a_beamery-foundation

So for AWS EKS clusters, Amazon's guide (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/getting-started.html) tells you to use their heptio authenticator and that your .kube/config should look like:
```
apiVersion: v1
clusters:
- cluster:
    server: <endpoint-url>
    certificate-authority-data: <base64-encoded-ca-cert>
  name: kubernetes
contexts:
- context:
    cluster: kubernetes
    user: aws
  name: aws
current-context: aws
kind: Config
preferences: {}
users:
- name: aws
  user:
    exec:
      apiVersion: client.authentication.k8s.io/v1alpha1
      command: heptio-authenticator-aws
      args:
        - ""token""
        - ""-i""
        - ""<cluster-name>""
        # - ""-r""

      # env:
        # - name: AWS_PROFILE
        #   value: ""<aws-profile>""
```

But every time I switch contexts using `kubectx` it modifies the .kube/config to:
```
apiVersion: v1
clusters:
- cluster:
    server: <endpoint-url>
    certificate-authority-data: <base64-encoded-ca-cert>
  name: kubernetes
contexts:

    cluster: kubernetes
    user: aws
  name: aws
current-context: aws
kind: Config
preferences: {}
users:
- name: aws

I’m a fun of your project.
I’ve thought it will be nice if there is a Japanese version of README, because I sometimes have to make a small lesson about how to use/install this project for new employees who can not read English.

So I decided to add README in Japanese and create a pull request, although I’m not sure whether the location of README_ja.md is appropriate or not.
Please give me your opinion. 

Finally, when you want to update README, just create an issue or contact me. I’ll be happy to modify README_ja.md based on the changes of the original README.

In kubeconfig, Context is a thing that binds together Cluster, User and Namespace.

We have a `kubectx` command that mutates **global** `current-context` in kubeconfig.
We also have a `kubens` command that mutates `namespace` **inside the current Context**.

So why don't we have a `kubecl` (name TBD) that mutates `cluster` inside the current Context?
And maybe even `kubeusr` (or something) that does the same for `user`?

---

As far as I understand, the current assumption behind kubectx is that each Context is completely isolated (e.g. minikube vs GKE), so switching between Clusters while keeping User and even Namespace is meaningless.

On the other hand, I'd like to be able to switch between multiple production Clusters while keeping the same User and Namespace. With an extra benefit of not having to create N contexts for managing N clusters.

We can detect if `kubectx` command is executed in interactive mode OR eval'ed in a shell (like `eval $(kubectx ...)`, piped elsewhere or redirected to a file, by checking if /dev/stdout is a TTY or not.

**If kubectx is evaluated in a shell, we can print an `alias` that aliases kubectl to `kubectl --context=NAME`. So when that shell is exited, the default context would go back to what's set before. This would let users work on multiple clusters simultaneously in different terminal tabs. It would look like this:**

    eval $(kubectx NAME)

and it would print something like `alias kubectl=kubectl --context=NAME` which then is evaluated in the current shell, therefore creating an alias. Similarly, `eval $(kubens ...)` would also evaluate an `alias kubectl=kubectl --namespace=NAME` (these two wouldn't work together, but I might have a solution for that too, by writing a basic bash function that picks up these names from env.

I'm wondering if it's possible to implement the zsh part using a zsh plugin (with ZLE widgets) instead of patching zsh. The advantage would be that it will be easier to experiment with code changes on the ZSH side (no need to compile ZSH), easier to update to newer zsh versions, and it would possibly be easier to make it work well with other ZLE widgets.

Just wanted to post that the full installation of athame as my default readline didn't work for me. I gathered this was because of a readline problem, but I couldn't manage to solve it. Here is the output of `ldd $(which bash)`:

```
linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007fffe9d90000)
libtinfo.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libtinfo.so.6 (0x00007f926bf8c000)
libdl.so.2 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libdl.so.2 (0x00007f926bf87000)
libc.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0x00007f926bdc6000)
/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007f926c114000)
```

And indeed I don't see libreadline. The `./readline_athame_setup.sh --use_sudo` does work, but then running `./bash_readline_setup.sh --use_sudo` gives me this error:

```
(...)
config.status: creating po/Makefile
config.status: executing default commands
make: *** empty string invalid as file name.  Stop.

Make failed: Are you sure you have readline 8 installed? readline_athame_setup.sh installs readline 8 patched with athame. You may want to run it first.
This may also fail if you have a versionless libreadline.so symlinked to libreadline.so.7
```

I tried installing myself readline 8, with the same output. However, the local install worked, and my workaround was to change my shell to the local one, but still, I'm curious as to what happened there!

If you have any hints or solutions for this, I'd be grateful to try it :)

My current vimrc and athame do not play nice. On the other hand no vimrc and athame seem to get along just fine (e.g. throwing in a ATHAME_TEST_RC=1). 

I'm willing to contribute a patch if this doesn't yet exist. I would probably do so as a file list in a shell variable. For example:

`export ATHAME_VIM_RC_FILES=/home/user/config/vimrcForAthame1.vim;\
/home/user/config/vimrcForAthame2.vim`

In addition, I would probably add the following to the invocation of the vim process:

`vim --cmd ""let g:athamerc=1""  -S vimbed.vim -S athamerc.... <or whatever is currently done>`

Thoughts?

I want to create package for distribution Athame on Arch Linux using Arch User Repository (https://aur.archlinux.org/), Arch uses PKGBUILD (bash script) for building packages on client machine, and PKGBUILD provides special directive `sources` for files that must be downloaded and verified using signatures: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/PKGBUILD#Sources

2 years ago I've tried to do it without bash script that provided in athame upstream (I guess it was not exists 2 years ago) here https://github.com/kovetskiy/athame-zsh-pkgbuild/blob/master/PKGBUILD
Now bash_readline_setup.sh contains lines with automatically downloading of bash and bash patches and now it's not compatible with Arch Linux build ecosystem, can you please add some flag line `--do-not-download` or may be create two separated scripts? 

Also it will be great to see separated commands for building and installing athame, like make and make install (now bash_readline_setup automatically runs make install for readline).

I'm running with `zsh` and `tmux` with `urxvt`. I just install athame and everything seems fine except some `mv`:

```
mv /usr/lib/libreadline.a /usr/lib/libreadline.old
mv: could not evaluate « /usr/lib/libreadline.a »: No such file or directory
make: [install-static] Erreur 1 (ignored)
/usr/bin/install -c -m 644 libreadline.a /usr/lib/libreadline.a
test -n ""ranlib"" && ranlib /usr/lib/libreadline.a

make: [install-static] Erreur 1 (ignored)
/usr/bin/install -c -m 644 libhistory.a /usr/lib/libhistory.a
```

Now what? How can I check that the modded libreadline has been installed correctly? How may I test this? I've started a new `bash` shell (without `tmux`) but there is no `vi`. Theoretically this should work with `zsh` too?

Thanks! This project is looking great, hope it'll get through beta soon :)

I'm not sure if this is the appropriate channel to make this complain, but the last few versions of Chromium for Android have a very annoying bug.

They can't display any HTML5 player on any page.

Sorry for not give a very technical description, and sorry if this is a known bug, but i'm a recent Chromium user on Android.
By the way, i'm on  4.4.4 KitKat.

since my update to Chromium 55, I cannot sign in to google anymore (to sync my bookmarks and whatever). I don’t get any errors or such, it just won’t sign in. (If I enter a wrong two factor authentication key, though, then an error message is shown.)

Since we have no binaries to offer, I imagine this ticket will just remain as documentation of this stuff for now. :)

* **Platform**: Linux 5.4.0-58-generic #64~18.04.1-Ubuntu SMP Wed Dec 9 17:11:11 UTC 2020 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

## Summary 

When:

1. class `A` extends `B` and
2. class `A`’s constructor calls `super()` and
3. class `A` constructor contains a return statement

Then:

The line containing the closing brace of the constructor method is shown as uncovered by c8.

## To reproduce

(Testing with latest `c8`, `tape` and `tap-nyc` in a `""type"": ""module""` node project.)

1. Create class `A` in _A.js_:

```js
import B from './B.js'

export default class A extends B {
  constructor () {
    super()
    return
  }
}
```

2. Create class `B` in _B.js_:

```js
export default class B {}
```

3. Create the test in `test.js`:

```js
import test from 'tape'
import A from './A.js'

test('bug', t => {
  const a = new A()
  t.true(a instanceof A, 'the returned object is as expected')
  t.end()
})
```

3. Run coverage:

```
 npx c8 node test.js | npx tap-nyc
```

## What should happen

Coverage should be 100%

## What actually happens

Class `A`’s coverage is 66.67%, with line 7 flagged as uncovered.

## Workaround

Ignore the return statement _and the line after it_. e.g., modify the constructor in class `A` from the above example to match the following:

```js
import B from './B.js'

export default class A extends B {
  constructor () {
    super()
    /* c8 ignore next 2 */
    return
  }
}

Would be amazing to have ability to skip full report using command line option, like [in nyc](https://github.com/istanbuljs/nyc#common-configuration-options).

## 1.0.0 (2021-02-02)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* new test-exclude with modified exclude rules (#179)
* **istanbul-reports:** lcov reports now use relative paths (#168)
* Node.js' source-map and lineLength cache is now used to remap coverage output (this allows tools like ts-node to be supported, which transpile at runtime).
* temp directory now defaults to setting for report directory
* c8 will now load source-maps if possible and remap coverage accordingly
* switches to using NODE_V8_COVERAGE rather than inspector directly
* dropped subprocess support for the time being, while we march towards an initial implementation.

### Features

* **Version**: 15.5.1

* **chai version**: 4.2.0

<!-- Enter your issue details below this comment. -->

It seems that the way the chai assertion library traps exceptions that are thrown causes c8 not to mark the executed lines as covered. I don't know if the issue is caused by c8 or by chai, though.

### Steps to reproduce

Consider the following source file (`index.mjs`):

```javascript
function f(x)
{
    if (x == 0)
    {
        throw ""foo"";
    }
}

export {f};
```

And the following chai test case (`test/test.test.js`):

```javascript
import pkg_chai from ""chai"";
const { expect } = pkg_chai;

import {f} from ""../index.mjs"";

it(""Test 1"", () => {
    expect(() => {f(0);}).to.throw;
});
```

### Expected outcome

- The test passes (since the exception is thrown)
- Line 5 in `index.mjs` is marked as covered

### Observed outcome

- The test passes
- Line 5 is not marked as covered

### Additional note

If I replace the test case with this alternate version:

```javascript
import pkg_chai from ""chai"";
const { expect } = pkg_chai;

import {f} from ""../index.mjs"";

it(""Test 1"", () => {
    var thrown = false;
    try {
      f(0);
    }
    catch(e) {
      thrown = true;
    }
    expect(thrown).to.be.true;
});
```

<!-- Enter your issue details below this comment. -->

We have started to get code coverage related failures in our build environments, correlated to our build environment moving from Node 15.4 to 15.5 from 'node:latest' DockerHub image.

Suddenly code coverage that was passing has begun failing with lines that we attempt to ignore showing as uncovered.

When looking at these new cases of uncovered lines, we are noticing this happening around cases where we have what are actually overlapping ignore directives set.

For example, one of the cases that surfaced was in the code below. 

```
/* c8 ignore next 82 */

We have started to get code coverage related failures in our build environments, correlated to our build environment moving from Node 15.4 to 15.5 from 'node:latest' DockerHub image.

Suddenly code coverage that was passing has begun failing with lines that we attempt to ignore showing as uncovered.

When looking at these new cases of uncovered lines, we are noticing this happening around cases where we have what are actually overlapping ignore directives set.

For example, one of the cases that surfaced was in the code below. 

```
/* c8 ignore next 82 */
const cloneStoreConfigMap = (map, optsDecorator) => {
  /* c8 ignore next */
  const decoratorFn = optsDecorator || ( (storeOpts) => storeOpts );
 ...
}
```

Note how the 4th line shown here is actually ignored by both directives. They overlap.  What we are finding happening now is that it seems these overlap cases are now causing the prior directive to be turned off.   So we show the 2nd line above as covered. It may actually be exercised in our tests, so not sure if this is because of `next 82` directive or actual code execution).  The lines starting with the 5th line (my `...` above) until the end of the 82-line function are now showing as uncovered.

Now obviously we have some sloppy use of our ignores here that we need to clean up, but just wanted to open the issue, as nothing in the documentation would lead me to believe these overlapping ignore directives should not work.

### [`v16.0.1`](https://togithub.com/standard/standard/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;1601---2020-10-30)

[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/standard/standard/compare/v16.0.0...v16.0.1)

-   Introduce ""warning"" system for disruptive rules (read more below)
-   Change rule to a ""warning"": Require let or const instead of var ([no-var](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-var)) [#&#8203;633](https://togithub.com/standard/standard/issues/633)

`standard` treats all rule violations as errors, which means that `standard`
will exit with a non-zero (error) exit code.

However, we may occasionally release a new major version of `standard`
which changes a rule that affects the majority of `standard` users (for example,
transitioning from `var` to `let`/`const`). We do this only when we think the
advantage is worth the cost and only when the rule is
[auto-fixable](https://standardjs.com/#is-there-an-automatic-formatter).

In these situations, we have a ""transition period"" where the rule change is only
a ""warning"". Warnings don't cause `standard` to return a non-zero (error)
exit code. However, a warning message will still print to the console. During
the transition period, `using standard --fix` will update your code so that it's
ready for the next major version.

The slow and careful approach is what we strive for with `standard`. We're
generally extremely conservative in enforcing the usage of new language
features. We want using `standard` to be light and fun and so we're careful
about making changes that may get in your way. As always, you can
[disable a rule](https://standardjs.com/#how-do-i-disable-a-rule) at any time, if necessary.

### [`v16.0.0`](https://togithub.com/standard/standard/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;1600---2020-10-28)

[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/standard/standard/compare/v15.0.1...v16.0.0)

We're super excited to announce `standard` 16!

As with every new major release, there are lots of new rules in 16.0.0 designed
to help catch bugs and make programmer intent more explicit. This release brings
better performance, tons of bug fixes, improved JSX, React ⚛️, and Next.js support!

When you upgrade, consider running `standard --fix` to automatically format your
code to match the newly added rules.

##### New features

-   🏎 Better performance: the filesystem doesn't need to be traversed multiple times! [#&#8203;1023](https://togithub.com/standard/standard/issues/1023)

    -   Massive improvements (on the order of minutes!) for projects with huge folders which are are ignored with `.gitignore`

-   🌟 Support the `.gitignore` ignore syntax from the command line [#&#8203;1117](https://togithub.com/standard/standard/issues/1117)

    -   In older versions, the command `standard src` would not lint the `src/` folder
    -   Instead, a glob pattern like `standard src/**/*.js` was required
    -   This is now fixed! You can run `standard src` to lint the `src/` folder!

-   🌟 Support relative paths from the command line in more situations (e.g. `standard ../src/*.js`) [#&#8203;1384](https://togithub.com/standard/standard/issues/1384)

-   🌟 New `extensions` option for linting additional extensions besides `.js`, `.jsx`, `.mjs`, and `.cjs`

    -   Can be configured with the `--ext` command line flag or in `package.json`:
    -   Example:

        ```bash
        standard --ext .ts
        ```

        ```json
        {
          ""standard"": {
            ""extensions"": ["".ts""]
          }
        }
        ```

-   🌟 New cache directory location, respecting `XDG_CACHE_HOME` preference, with fallback to `~/.cache/standard` [standard-engine/#&#8203;214](https://togithub.com/standard/standard-engine/pull/214)

##### Changed features

-   Update `eslint` from `~7.11.0` to `~7.12.1`

-   Update `standard-engine` from `^12` to `^14`

    -   Fix inaccurate `--help` command which indicates that `bundle.js` is automatically ignored when it is not anymore [standard-engine/#&#8203;224](https://togithub.com/standard/standard-engine/pull/224)
    -   Remove `deglob` package and use built-in ESLint folder-traversal support

-   Paths with square brackets (e.g. `[` and `]`) are no longer skipped [#&#8203;1333](https://togithub.com/standard/standard/issues/1333)

    -   This pattern is particularly common in Next.js apps, e.g. `blog/[slug].js`
    -   You may notice new errors in these files since they were not being linted before

-   Better mono-repo support: Nested `node_modules/` folders are ignored by default [#&#8203;1182](https://togithub.com/standard/standard/issues/1182)

-   Remove `eslint-plugin-standard` [#&#8203;1316](https://togithub.com/standard/standard/issues/1316)
    -   We migrated the remaining `no-callback-literal` rule into `eslint-plugin-node`

-   Support ES 2021, the latest version of the ECMAScript specification, which includes support for [logical assignment operators](https://togithub.com/tc39/proposal-logical-assignment) and [numeric separators](https://togithub.com/tc39/proposal-numeric-separator) [#&#8203;1551](https://togithub.com/standard/standard/issues/1551)
-   Support ES 2020 features such as [optional chaining](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Optional_chaining), the [nullish coalescing operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Nullish_coalescing_operator), `export * as ns from 'source'`, and [`import.meta`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import.meta).
-   Support global variables from ES 2017 (`Atomics`, `SharedArrayBuffer`), ES 2020 (`BigInt`, `BigInt64Array`, `BigUint64Array`, `globalThis`), and ES 2021 (`FinalizationRegistry`, `WeakRef`). [#&#8203;1436](https://togithub.com/standard/standard/issues/1436) [#&#8203;1557](https://togithub.com/standard/standard/issues/1557) [eslint-config-standard/#&#8203;156](https://togithub.com/standard/eslint-config-standard/pull/156)
-   The documentation is now available in Indonesian 🇮🇩! [#&#8203;1544](https://togithub.com/standard/standard/pull/1544)
    -   Thanks to [@&#8203;yoga1234](https://togithub.com/yoga1234) for the excellent work!
    -   Other community contributed translations exist in Spanish, French, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Simplified Chinese, and Taiwanese Mandarin.
    -   More translations are always welcome!

##### Changed features

-   BREAKING: Node.js 8 is no longer supported
    -   Node.js 8 is EOL and will no longer be receiving security updates.
    -   To prevent breaking CI for projects which still support Node 8, `standard` silently passes when run by an unsupported version of Node
-   Update `eslint` from `~6.8.0` to `~7.11.0`

##### New rules

_(Estimated % of affected standard users, based on test suite in parens)_

##### Changed rules

-   Relax rule: Allow function declarations in nested blocks [#&#8203;1406](https://togithub.com/standard/standard/issues/1406)
-   Relax rule: Removed redundant `no-negated-in-lhs` rule, already enforced by `no-unsafe-negation` [eslint-config-standard/#&#8203;160](https://togithub.com/standard/eslint-config-standard/pull/160)

* dropped subprocess support for the time being, while we march towards an initial implementation.

but this doesn't work. What works is passing multiple `exclude` flags:
```
npx c8 --all --exclude ""upgrade/**"" --exclude ""test/**"" npm run test
```
and it looks like I can also exclude folders by just passing the folder directly:
```
npx c8 --all --exclude ""upgrade"" --exclude ""test"" npm run test
```
----
Is the multiple flags method the intended way of passing exclusions, or is there a way to do it with only one flag?

Is the folder exclusion possibility intended and safe to write, or does it just work by accident? I thought it might be unintended because the default exclusion list includes constructs like `""coverage/**""` and `""test{,s}/**""` and it seems they could be simplified down to `""coverage""` and `""test{,s}""` if directory exclusion was supposed to work.",NA,FALSE,https://api.github.com/repos/bcoe/c8,https://api.github.com/repos/bcoe/c8/issues/256/labels{/name},https://api.github.com/repos/bcoe/c8/issues/256/comments,https://api.github.com/repos/bcoe/c8/issues/256/events,https://github.com/bcoe/c8/issues/256,NA

Given this code in `index.js`:

```js
function fn() {
  return true;
  /* c8 ignore next */
  console.log('never runs');
}

fn();
```

Running with `ci node index.js`, I get this output:

When running `c8` with `mocha` for example, as such: `node node_modules/c8/bin/c8 node_modules/mocha/bin/mocha test.js`, it is not guaranty that the same node binary will be used to process c8 and mocha (and therefore the test), is this intended?

This is coming from this piece of code: https://github.com/bcoe/c8/blob/master/lib/parse-args.js#L131
```js
if (argv[0][0] === '-') {
    argv.unshift(process.execPath)
}
```
The node executable is only added if the first argument not parsed is an option. Why not doing it all the time?
In my case, I am using various node versions for my unit tests. And it might pick up the version in /usr/bin unless specially specified like this: `node node_modules/c8/bin/c8 node node_modules/mocha/bin/mocha test.js`
To me, this seems redundant and not intuitive. The current behavior might lead to unexpected issues that might be hard to spot.

I was trying to figure out how it works recently & noticed you're loading 7 dependencies to hunt for a config file.
While it's not a _significant_ part of your dependency chain, it's still a [branch that can be removed](https://npm.anvaka.com/#!/view/2d/c8).

Instead, `escalade` is 21 lines of code and has no dependencies. It's also [faster than `find-up`](https://github.com/lukeed/escalade#benchmarks) and supports native ESM when `c8` moves its source that way.

There's also a security advantage – `find-up` will continue traversal into your `/` directory (wtf) before giving up. Escalade stops at the `process.cwd()` directory, which one would expect...

FWIW, I may have just _released_ `""escalade""` but I've been using this internally for a while.
Didn't set out to replace `find-up`, but once these comparison points dawned on me, I figured it needs sharing.

#### :boom: Breaking Changes

-   [#&#8203;4164](https://togithub.com/mochajs/mocha/issues/4164): **Mocha v8.0.0 now requires Node.js v10.0.0 or newer.** Mocha no longer supports the Node.js v8.x line (""Carbon""), which entered End-of-Life at the end of 2019 ([**@&#8203;UlisesGascon**](https://togithub.com/UlisesGascon))

-   [#&#8203;4175](https://togithub.com/mochajs/mocha/issues/4175): Having been deprecated with a warning since v7.0.0, **`mocha.opts` is no longer supported** ([**@&#8203;juergba**](https://togithub.com/juergba))

    :sparkles: **WORKAROUND:** Replace `mocha.opts` with a [configuration file](https://mochajs.org/#configuring-mocha-nodejs).

-   [#&#8203;4260](https://togithub.com/mochajs/mocha/issues/4260): Remove `enableTimeout()` (`this.enableTimeout()`) from the context object ([**@&#8203;craigtaub**](https://togithub.com/craigtaub))

    :sparkles: **WORKAROUND:** Replace usage of `this.enableTimeout(false)` in your tests with `this.timeout(0)`.

-   [#&#8203;4315](https://togithub.com/mochajs/mocha/issues/4315): The `spec` option no longer supports a comma-delimited list of files ([**@&#8203;juergba**](https://togithub.com/juergba))

    :sparkles: **WORKAROUND**: Use an array instead (e.g., `""spec"": ""foo.js,bar.js""` becomes `""spec"": [""foo.js"", ""bar.js""]`).

-   [#&#8203;4309](https://togithub.com/mochajs/mocha/issues/4309): Drop support for Node.js v13.x line, which is now End-of-Life ([**@&#8203;juergba**](https://togithub.com/juergba))

-   [#&#8203;4282](https://togithub.com/mochajs/mocha/issues/4282): `--forbid-only` will throw an error even if exclusive tests are avoided via `--grep` or other means ([**@&#8203;arvidOtt**](https://togithub.com/arvidOtt))

-   [#&#8203;4223](https://togithub.com/mochajs/mocha/issues/4223): The context object's `skip()` (`this.skip()`) in a ""before all"" (`before()`) hook will no longer execute subsequent sibling hooks, in addition to hooks in child suites ([**@&#8203;juergba**](https://togithub.com/juergba))

-   [#&#8203;4178](https://togithub.com/mochajs/mocha/issues/4178): Remove previously soft-deprecated APIs ([**@&#8203;wnghdcjfe**](https://togithub.com/wnghdcjfe)):
    -   `Mocha.prototype.ignoreLeaks()`
    -   `Mocha.prototype.useColors()`
    -   `Mocha.prototype.useInlineDiffs()`
    -   `Mocha.prototype.hideDiff()`

    :exclamation: See also [#&#8203;4244](https://togithub.com/mochajs/mocha/issues/4244); [Root Hook Plugins (docs)](https://mochajs.org/#root-hook-plugins) -- _root hooks must be defined via Root Hook Plugins to work in parallel mode_

-   [#&#8203;4304](https://togithub.com/mochajs/mocha/issues/4304): `--require` now works with ES modules ([**@&#8203;JacobLey**](https://togithub.com/JacobLey))

-   [#&#8203;4299](https://togithub.com/mochajs/mocha/issues/4299): In some circumstances, Mocha can run ES modules under Node.js v10 -- _use at your own risk!_ ([**@&#8203;giltayar**](https://togithub.com/giltayar))

#### :book: Documentation

-   [#&#8203;4246](https://togithub.com/mochajs/mocha/issues/4246): Add documentation for parallel mode and Root Hook plugins ([**@&#8203;boneskull**](https://togithub.com/boneskull))

So when working with compiled code the user needs to know the filepaths of the generated code.  This is awkward for users of systems like ours that perform filepath mangling during compilation.

`nyc` used to have this behavior, but it was swapped via the awesome [`--exclude-after-remap`](https://github.com/istanbuljs/nyc/issues/697) feature that [later became the default behavior](https://github.com/istanbuljs/nyc/blob/6898e88245bb8f9c530166e9b121519ec5963554/CHANGELOG.md#breaking-changes) via https://github.com/istanbuljs/nyc/pull/1010.  So in `nyc` now, exclusions are applied to the _source_ script paths.

I'd like to propose that `c8` should match the `nyc` behavior.  As this would be a breaking change, I guess we should introduce it behind a similar opt-in flag (`--exclude-after-remap`).

It looks like with the reporter update and the cobertura update somehow the snapshots managed to get out of date. I just ran `npm run test:snap` to update and manually verified there wasn't a serious regression.

Seems like something went off the rails with a previous merge. 

**Edit to add: Seems like pulling in the new reporter broke the snapshots. Previous examples that were in the format of `\d+,\d+` have turned into `\d-\d`. If we're okay with that I will submit a PR to update the snapshots and fix whatever is up with the cobertura test

Running `npm test` results in:

`test-exclude` unilaterally excludes files in parent (relative to cwd) directories. This was very confusing when I was trying to generate coverage reports from within my test directory and the tests were only referencing files in parent directories. The generated reports would always show no results no matter what options I passed to `c8` (e.g. `--all`, `--include`, `--exclude`, etc.).

At the very least this should be documented in the readme and additionally it would be nice to have the behavior be overridable (this would require changes to `test-exclude` since as of this writing it does not support overriding its relative path check).",NA,FALSE,https://api.github.com/repos/bcoe/c8,https://api.github.com/repos/bcoe/c8/issues/210/labels{/name},https://api.github.com/repos/bcoe/c8/issues/210/comments,https://api.github.com/repos/bcoe/c8/issues/210/events,https://github.com/bcoe/c8/issues/210,NA

We're currently leveraging the `index.js` programmatically via `require(""c8"")` for a build system that is bit non standard in that multiple `dist` directories for various projects can be leveraged in a workspace that is outside the cwd of where the test are run. 

This change modifies the interface to `Report` but not the CLI in the following ways:

* It allows `src` to be supplied as a Array of string paths. 
* If `src` isn't supplied, src is overridden to the default `cwd`, the main CLI doesn't currently allow these directories to be supplied to avoid over complicating the CLI interface.
* An additional flag for `allowExternal` is supplied and passed to `test-exlude` to indicate that not all paths will be relative. Not supplying this flag causes `test-exclude` to reject anything outside of `cwd`.

****DRAFT: 

We're currently leveraging the `index.js` programmatically via `require(""c8"")` for a build system that is bit non standard in that multiple `dist` directories for various projects can be leveraged in a workspace that is outside the cwd of where the test are run. 

This change modifies the interface to `Report` but not the CLI in the following ways:

* It allows `src` to be supplied as a Array of string paths. 
* If `src` isn't supplied, src is overriden to the default `cwd`, the main CLI doesn't currently allow these directories to be supplied to avoid over complicating the CLI interface.
* An additional flag for `allowExternal` is supplied and passed to `test-exlude` to indicate that not all paths will be relative. Not supplying this flag causes `test-exclude` to reject anything outside of `cwd`.
 
Please don't merge this just yet as I'm still testing, writing tests. But I wanted to get your thoughts if this was a feasible enhancement.

This yea

I'm working on an experimental loader hook for nyc to provide coverage of ES modules.  Initially my scripts looked like:
```js
{
  ""test"": ""c8 --include index.js -r none node test/index.js | tap-yaml-summary"",
  ""posttest"": ""c8 report""
}
```

Running `c8 report` in a follow-up process was done to allow the text report to display in color (piping into tap-yaml-summary would normally disable color).

I was surprised to find that the `--include index.js` (restricting by include) did not work.  It seems include/exclude options have no effect on coverage collection, instead it only controls coverage reporting.  Once I moved the `--include index.js` to the `c8 report` it produced the expected report.

I don't know if the functionality can be improved or if this could just be documented.  Maybe recommend against controlling include/exclude using CLI arguments in favor of `.c8rc.json`?",NA,FALSE,https://api.github.com/repos/bcoe/c8,https://api.github.com/repos/bcoe/c8/issues/204/labels{/name},https://api.github.com/repos/bcoe/c8/issues/204/comments,https://api.github.com/repos/bcoe/c8/issues/204/events,https://github.com/bcoe/c8/issues/204,NA

For example where node's `path.resolve` might provide you with `c:\src\main.js` it would be perfectly fine on windows to tell v8 that the script resource was `c:\src\MAIN.js`. If you then try to measure coverage with all, the mismatch in casing between v8's blobs and node's file system results cause the system to report duplicate empty records for files that are actually in the blobs, just differ on case.

Prior to my fix test output vs the correct snapshot  would like like:

```
     AssertionError: expected value to match snapshot c8 --all should, given path casing mismatches between path.resolve and v8 output, NOT contain duplicate report entries 1

* **Platform**: win32

This is a bit of a ""canned"" issue because it assumes that https://github.com/bcoe/c8/issues/183 is fixed upstream. But when testing out my fix https://github.com/istanbuljs/test-exclude/pull/44 I noticed there is an additional path casing issue in `c8` related to the implementation of `--all`.

On windows, using local files it is possible for v8 to generate file names like: `d:\path\to\my\file.js`
note the lower case drive letter.

But later when find `--all` files the node api post call to `resolve` will return the same string paths with a upper case drive letter. This is what originally caused https://github.com/bcoe/c8/issues/183. 

However, once #183 is fixed and `test-exclude`'s `shouldInstrument` returns true for case mismatches, this additional mismatch in `c8`'s `fileIndex` Set which we use to track if a file has been seen causes duplicates in the final report: 

For example the output might be as follows:
```
  file1.js     |       0 |        0 |       0 |       0 | 1-36              
  file1.js     |     100 |      100 |     100 |     100 |                   
  file2.js     |       0 |        0 |       0 |       0 | 1-106             
  file2.js     |   90.57 |   
```

My current thoughts were to replace `fileIndex` the `Set` with an overridden Set that would `toLowerCase` keys when `win32` is detected.

 `return !minimatch(path.resolve(dir, filename), path.join(dir, '**'), dot);`

Will return true, incorrectly indicating that the file is outside our cwd, Whereas including `nocase` in the options (supplied as dot) will correctly return false.

# Description

In some cases (see below), c8 considers the newlines after a return statement to be ""uncovered code"".

# Steps to reproduce

1. Install c8:

    ```console
    $ npm install c8
    ```

2. Write the following content to `src/index.mjs`:

    ```js
    const f = ({}) => {
      const b = {};
      return;
    }

    f ({});
    ```

3. Write the following content to `test/index.mjs`:

    ```js
    import '../src/index.mjs'
    ```

4. Run c8:

    ```console
    $ c8 node --experimental-modules test/index.mjs 
    (node:4857) ExperimentalWarning: The ESM module loader is experimental.

    ```

# Expected result

I expect to see no uncovered lines.

# Actual result

Line `3` (`    return;`) is considered ""partially covered"". If I add additional newlines after the return statement, they come up as fully uncovered lines. If I remove the statement prior to the return statement, the problem goes away. If I stop using destructuring in the function arguments, the problem also goes away.

Was updating a package to change a `createRequire` style import of `package.json` into the now-supported direct `import` of the package file.   In doing so, the `package.json` file is now showing up in coverage reports  and failing on uncovered function.

**Original working code**

```
import { createRequire } from 'module';

We use c8 with the cobertura reporter.
Moving from node 10 to node 12 the generated XML was invalid and crashed the Jenkins Cobertura  publisher.

It seems that node 12 the '(anonymous function)' now becomes '`<computed>`' and the '<' character is invalid inside an attribute (in the cobertura-coverage.xml).

For example:
Node12
`<method name=""self.cam.<computed>.handler"" hits=""6"" signature=""()V"">`

Node10
`<method name=""self.cam.(anonymous function).handler"" hits=""6"" signature=""()V"">`

Greetings,
I've recently started to write unit tests for one of our projects, using mocha, and I've noticed that the reports generated by c8 show some discrepancies, when switching between Node v10.15 and v10.16.

Using Node v10.15:
![Bildschirmfoto 2019-09-02 um 13 20 44](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15343316/64111258-8444f680-cd84-11e9-825f-26bb80425eeb.png)

Using Node v10.16:

I noticed that the `Uncovered lines` section in particular shows very different results.
In both cases I used `c8@5.0.1`.

I could probably live with the 0.05% difference in the `statements` and `lines` sections (for now, at least), but an almost 18% difference for `branch` is rather huge. 

So the question is:
How can I tell which one of these reports is more accurate?

Here are the full coverage logs:

I get differing coverage reports depending on if I run the test on Windows 10 x64 vs Ubuntu x64. Both platforms are running Node 12.9.1. The issue seems to only affect specific files in the test suite/application.

### Windows

The pattern is always the same in all affected files. The imports are shown as not covered and so is the class and method declaration.

When I tried to isolate the behavior in a smaller projects, I was not able to. Any suggestions on how to approach this so I can get more useful information?

Every time I start c8, I get the following warning:
`(node:12776) [DEP0005] DeprecationWarning: Buffer() is deprecated due to security and usability issues. Please use the Buffer.alloc(), Buffer.allocUnsafe(), or Buffer.from() methods instead.`

This is because `foreground-child` uses `cross-spawn`, which uses `new Buffer()`.

`cross-spawn` has recently finally [resolved this issue](https://github.com/moxystudio/node-cross-spawn/commit/16feb534e818668594fd530b113a028c0c06bddc), but it'll probably take quite some time until the change trickles downstream.

* **Windows 10 / Node 12.6.0 with --experimental-modules / tap 14.6.1**:

We are finding ourselves needing to always inject `/* c8 ignore next */` in our async functions in order to get passing coverage results.  I have included sample code below.

Typical command line usage would be `c8 tap` (oftentimes with --check-coverage flags as well).

It should be noted that these cases where we find this behavior are all in Node --experimental-modules environments where we are using the ES modules format. (This is actually what led us to use c8 / tap in the first place as it they play nicely with native ESModules without need for ESM loader or similar)

There seem to be two different scenarios where branch covereage reporting is problematic.

case 1 - standard function return 
```
async function () {
    // some code
   return; // must ignore this line to get branch coverage
};
```

case 2 - then() function
```
const value = await someThenable()
  .then( (data) => {
     // do something;
    return data;
  }); // must ignore this line to get branch coverage
```

** Sample code under test**

I can get 100% branch coverage on this file only with each async function return ignored from coverage reports as shown.

We're super excited to announce `standard` 14!

As with every new major release, there are lots of new rules in 14.0.0 designed
to help catch bugs and make programmer intent more explicit. This release brings
support for ES 2019, the latest version of the ECMAScript specification, as well
as many quality-of-life improvements for users who use tagged template strings,
JSX, and `.mjs` files for ES modules.

When you upgrade, consider running `standard --fix` to automatically format your
code to match the newly added rules.

`standard` keeps growing! The latest stats show that `standard` and
`eslint-standard-*` shareable configs are depended upon by **318,512 GitHub
repositories** and **33,349 public npm packages**. Thanks for spreading the
word!

We now have a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/ZegqCBr). Come chat with the
maintainers, ask questions, and get help from the community!

Welcome to the latest version of `standard`!

As with every new major release, there are lots of new rules in 13.0.0 designed
to help catch bugs and make programmer intent more explicit.

`standard` is more popular than ever – **640,000 downloads per month!** It's
even more popular – **3,000,000 downloads per month** – if you include the
[ESLint configuration](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-standard)
that we also publish (for advanced users).

When you upgrade, consider running `standard --fix` to automatically format your code to match the newly added rules.

❤️ If you enjoy StandardJS and want to support future releases, check out Feross's [GitHub Sponsors page](https://togithub.com/users/feross/sponsorship). GitHub is matching donations, so your dollars go twice as far! 🚀

##### New features

-   Update `eslint` from `~5.16.0` to `~6.0.1`

    -   BREAKING: Node.js 6 is no longer supported

        -   Node.js 6 is EOL and will no longer be receiving security updates. As a result, the eslint team has decided to drop support for it.
        -   To prevent breaking CI for projects which still support Node 6, `standard` silently passes when run by an unsupported version of Node.

    -   **For `eslint-config-standard` users only:** Plugins are no longer affected by `eslint`'s location
        -   Previously, ESLint loaded plugins relative to the location of the ESLint package itself. As a result, we suggested that users with global ESLint installations should also install plugins globally, and users with local ESLint installations should install plugins locally.
        -   With ESLint v6, plugins should always be installed locally, even if ESLint was installed globally. More precisely, ESLint v6 resolves plugins relative to the end user’s project by default, and always resolves shareable configs and parsers relative to the location of the config file that imports them.
        -   See [migrating to ESLint 6.0.0 for more information](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/migrating-to-6.0.0#-plugins-and-shareable-configs-are-no-longer-affected-by-eslints-location).

-   The documentation is now available in Japanese 🇯🇵!

    -   Thanks to [@&#8203;Munieru](https://togithub.com/munierujp) for the excellent work!
    -   Other community contributed translations exist in Spanish, French, Italian, Korean, Portuguese, Simplified Chinese, and Taiwanese Mandarin.
    -   More translations are always welcome!

-   Update `eslint-plugin-promise` from `~4.0.0` to `~4.2.1`

-   Update `eslint-plugin-node` from `~7.0.1` to `~9.1.0`

Welcome to the latest version of `standard`!

As with every new major release, there are lots of new rules in 13.0.0 designed
to help catch bugs and make programmer intent more explicit.

`standard` is more popular than ever – **640,000 downloads per month!** It's
even more popular – **3,000,000 downloads per month** – if you include the
[ESLint configuration](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-standard)
that we also publish (for advanced users).

When you upgrade, consider running `standard --fix` to automatically format your code to match the newly added rules.

❤️ If you enjoy StandardJS and want to support future releases, check out Feross's [GitHub Sponsors page](https://togithub.com/users/feross/sponsorship). GitHub is matching donations, so your dollars go twice as far! 🚀

##### New features

-   Update `eslint` from `~5.16.0` to `~6.0.1`

    -   BREAKING: Node.js 6 is no longer supported

        -   Node.js 6 is EOL and will no longer be receiving security updates. As a result, the eslint team has decided to drop support for it.
        -   To prevent breaking CI for projects which still support Node 6, `standard` silently passes when run by an unsupported version of Node.

    -   **For `eslint-config-standard` users only:** Plugins are no longer affected by `eslint`'s location
        -   Previously, ESLint loaded plugins relative to the location of the ESLint package itself. As a result, we suggested that users with global ESLint installations should also install plugins globally, and users with local ESLint installations should install plugins locally.
        -   With ESLint v6, plugins should always be installed locally, even if ESLint was installed globally. More precisely, ESLint v6 resolves plugins relative to the end user’s project by default, and always resolves shareable configs and parsers relative to the location of the config file that imports them.
        -   See [migrating to ESLint 6.0.0 for more information](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/migrating-to-6.0.0#-plugins-and-shareable-configs-are-no-longer-affected-by-eslints-location).

-   The documentation is now available in Japanese 🇯🇵!

    -   Thanks to [@&#8203;Munieru](https://togithub.com/munierujp) for the excellent work!
    -   Other community contributed translations exist in Spanish, French, Italian, Korean, Portuguese, Simplified Chinese, and Taiwanese Mandarin.
    -   More translations are always welcome!

-   Update `eslint-plugin-promise` from `~4.0.0` to `~4.2.1`

-   Update `eslint-plugin-node` from `~7.0.1` to `~9.1.0`

I've found this thread https://github.com/bcoe/c8/issues/115 but still haven't figured out the answer. 
How to use `--include` properly? 
I want to calculate the coverage for the whole project.
Tried like this for example:
`""test"": ""NODE_ENV=test NODE_V8_COVERAGE=coverage c8 --include [\""**/*.{js,jsx}\""] jest --color --forceExit --detectOpenHandles --maxWorkers=5"",`  but also got only empty report (not empty without `--include`)
BTW there is no config file currently, right? Only CLI parameters.

However, rather than reimplementing the internal logic we see in this lib it would be great if there was a public facing API that could be used by downstream integrators.

For this kind of integration the main functionality needed
- gathering coverage (without child process/forking)
- producing machine readable reports (in this case we're after lcov)
- merging reports between projects that might have overlapping coverage

A code example of the api we're after might look like this
```
const c8 = require('c8');

c8.collectCoverage({reporters: ['text-summary', 'lcov']});
jasmine.execute();
const reports = await c8.completeCoverage();

const textSummaryReport = reports.find(r => r.type = 'text-summary');
console.log(textSummaryReport);

cons lcovReport = reports.find(r => r.type = 'lcov');
fs.writeFileSync('to/some/location', lcovReport);
// or maybe merge/process it in some other way
```

Some important points here:
- The lib should not do any IO
- The lib should not require environment variables to collect coverage

I'd be happy to contribute to this design or implementation if needed.

Hi, I have a question about `--include` parameter. I have tried to target a specific file (`--include [""src/api/foo.ts""]`) and to use a glob pattern (`--include [""src/**""]`) but the only thing I got was a completely empty report. Am I using this parameter correctly?

Btw I run tests with `ts-node` (I guess that could be important. Even though the basic c8 usage works perfectly :)

Thanks a lot!

After running my tests I get a coverage report that reports empty lines as being uncovered.

This is one of the files where it does this:
```
const config = require(""config"");
const logger = require(""./logger"");

const geocoderConfig = config.geocoder
const apiKey = geocoderConfig.apiKey;
const extra = {
  apiKey: apiKey,
  timeout: 30000
};

const geocoder = require(""node-geocoder"")(""google"", ""https"", extra);

exports.geocode = (address, zip, city, country) => {

  let params = {
    address: address + ' ' + zip + ' ' + city + ' ' + country
  };

  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    geocoder.geocode(
      params, (error, result) => {

        /* c8 ignore next 3 */
        if (error) {
          logger.error(""Error geocoding: "" + JSON.stringify({error, result}, null, 3));
          return reject(error);
        }

        /* c8 ignore next 5 */
        if (!result || result.length === 0)
          return resolve({

          longitude: result[0].longitude
        });
      });
  });

```

I have some JavaScript configuration files that are dynamically generated during tests. It seems that those generated JS files are also counted as part of the source code. These config files are generated inside a temporary directory created by [tmp](https://github.com/raszi/node-tmp), and they will be `require()`ed during the test.

[Here is a simple repro](https://github.com/eight04/node-test/tree/c8-dynamic-source), run `npm test` to see the error. It seems that this problem is Windows-only. At least, Travis doesn't show this error:
```

1. Is there a way to exclude a path/pattern from being processed by c8?
2. Can we ignore files *outside* of the project root by default?

Currently, when `c8` fails to create coverage reports because of, for example, unknown report type `--reporter=unknown`, it causes the following two problems:

__1__. The error is displayed as an `UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning` to end users.

```console
$ c8 --reporter=unknown echo """"

__2__. `c8` exits with code `0`.

```console

```

This patch solves those problems by explicitly catching report creation errors and exiting with `1`.

Coverage with source-maps seems to be working pretty well on my TypeScript projects (which makes me very happy 😄)

<img width=""688"" alt=""Screen Shot 2019-04-29 at 12 01 46 AM"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194609/56880565-25f0bb80-6a12-11e9-936c-612471193b8d.png"">

## Some Notable Changes

* lines in `v8-to-istanbul` now start with a count of `1`, prior to this we were relying on the fact that V8 would always have an outer function that has an execution count of `1` for all its lines.
  * this was not working reliably, once mapping was applied, and I figured why not just default to `count = 1` if the outer function was a tautology any ways?
* a bunch of methods in `c8` are now async, this was because the heavy-lifting [source-map](https://github.com/mozilla/source-map) library is async.

## TODO

- [x] write integration tests for a variety of source-maps.
- [x] make sure this doesn't introduce any major performance regressions on the Node.js codebase, which uses c8's reporting functionality.

If you would like to experiment, I am publishing this to a `next` branch, as `4.0.0-candidate.0`.

BREAKING CHANGE: c8 will now load source-maps if possible and remap coverage accordingly

CC: @SimenB (please take this for a spin if interested), @hashseed (I think this unblocks me from some of the remapping work I was bumping into issues on), @sebmck (would love your extra set of eyes).

The existing test results are too fragile to add new specs;

1. The snapshot of the first test affects the second one, the second affects the third, and so on.
2. The snapshot requires to be updated whenever the coverage of `c8` itself changes.

This patch makes each test independent, by setting different `--temp-directory` flag to every `spawnSync()`.

_I've been meaning to add this test for a while, but haven't had many OSS cycles... it's cool to see it work after months of noodling on V8/Node.js._

## Background

The new module system in Node.js does not support `require.extensions`; while there is some work in motion to support similar extension mechanisms, it's unlikely to exist in time for `--experimental-modules` to be un-flagged.

 `c8` collects coverage using the inspector and the NODE_V8_COVERAGE environment variable, this is built into Node.js itself and does not require extending loaders.

Opening this PR as a rough start to adding source-map support. This works as is, but would like to get some feedback before cleaning it up, adding tests, etc.

Also, the globRoot changes are something else I needed, just didn't split them out. Would be great to get feedback on if that can be merged. If so, will split it out into another PR.

Hello, @bcoe!

Thank you for so awesome tool. 

I have tried `c8` and it satisfies all my needs except one. 
I have to generate two reports (one for unit tests coverage, other - for functional tests coverage). But the output directory is hardcoded for each run (see [this line](https://github.com/bcoe/c8/blob/master/lib/report.js#L37)). So i am not able to collect artifacts on my CI for both: unit tests and functional tests. This is a very minor issue and if you don't mind, i will try to fix it and create a PR.

Basically, this function just checks if `raw` is a string array.

I *think* I've exercised the code enough with my tests to have gotten 100% coverage.
But it seems like `c8` disagrees.

Does it expect every `if` statement to have a matching `else` statement?

Run a c8 Code Coverage session with my Node API Project with this Command Line:
c8 -r html -x node_modules node server.js

I hit a few APIs and then cleanly terminate the Server.

coverage/tmp/coverage-8140-1545948692773-0.json gets created and its Coverage is as expected.

But the HTML report generated by Istanbul is essentially empty.  Has the headings, but nothing is really there.

I can manually parse the file and create my own report out of it, but I don't really want to do that.

THANKS for c8...  Once I get it working, it will truly change how I look at Testing...

Neither of them gives correct `lineNumber`, `columnNumber` and `ranges` (`startOffset`, `endOffset`), unfortunately. 

## c8

when I run `c8 node test.js` where test.js is this file:

```js
function foo() {
  console.log(123)
}

foo()
```
I get this in the generated report:
```json
{""functionName"":""foo"",""ranges"":[{""startOffset"":62,""endOffset"":99,""count"":1}]
```
Note the `startOffset"":62` when there is 44 characters total in `test.js`. I am not even speaking about `""endOffset"":99`.


## inspector

after not successing with c8 I tried to place in my test.js code from this [example](https://nodejs.org/api/inspector.html#inspector_cpu_profiler)

and run `node test.js`
then I got this: 
```json
{""functionName"":""session.post"",""scriptId"":""66"",""url"":""file:///home/nurbol/www/sandbox/test.js"",""lineNumber"":5,""columnNumber"":32},""hitCount"":0,""children"":[16]}
```
Note the `""lineNumber"":5` when there is no anything on line number 5!

Then @bcoe gave me an [advice](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/22919#issuecomment-439613062) to take into accunt `require('module').wrapper[0]` that is inserted by node.js. But if done so, line number 5 contains `session.connect` and not `session.post` (see the json above)!

In v8-to-istanbul, the presence of `file://` in the specifier is used to determine whether or not the CJS header should be used to offset the results:

https://github.com/istanbuljs/v8-to-istanbul/blob/v1.2.1/lib/script.js#L120-L125
https://github.com/istanbuljs/v8-to-istanbul/blob/v1.2.1/lib/script.js#L13-L16

In c8, the specifier is resolved to a non-URL filepath before being passed to v8-to-istanbul:

https://github.com/bcoe/c8/blob/v3.2.1/lib/report.js#L51-L52

ESM modules that were run natively as ESM get interpreted as CJS as a consequence — incorrect offsets get applied to all ranges. When this is changed so that the original specifier is used the ranges are correct.

This behavior was introduced in 3.2.1 when trying to solve for a different issue related to file: specifiers.

I am opening this issue to share my thoughts on `c8`and Node coverage. I spent some time in August working on Node coverage, and I have some free time now so I am back at it.

My high level goal is to leverage V8's builtin coverage tools to get coverage for ES modules (currently behind the flag `--experimental-modules`).

# `c8` API

Using the builtin tools is not easy: it requires you to know how to interact with Node's inspector, how to enable profiling and then format the raw results to a human (or computer) readable report. This is were `c8` comes in: I want it to be a library that provides an easy API to work with coverage.

`c8` is currently a CLI tool only, but I would like to be able to use it as a library. My use case would be to integrate it with Gulp. I think that the CLI part should be a very thin wrapper on top of the API.

The core of the API would be a function called `runWithCoverage` (or similar name). It spawns an instrumented process and returns a promise for the V8 coverage. Additional functions would then let me generated reports from these coverages.

Since I want to use it as a library, I have strong expectations that the execution should be deterministic and encapsulated.
Determinism is simple: I want to have reproducible results. This means for example that random values should be avoided.
For encapsulation, it means that I can call the API multiple times and these calls do not interfere with each other. I should be able to perform multiple calls sequentially or concurrently. Encapsulation also means for me that it should avoid writing temporary files to the disk. Writing files to the disk may trigger side affects if the FS is watched, it exposes the files to be removed or modified.

# Coverage properties

Here are some properties regarding coverage to compare various implementations:

## Covered processes

The coverage can be either applied to a single direct child process or to a whole process subtree.
The earliest versions of `c8` only supported coverage for direct `node` child processes. Subprocesses were not covered. This is simple, but often not enough.
The main reason why we need to support process sub-tree coverage is that some test runners (like Mocha) use child processes to run the tests.

The easiest solution is to support sub-tree coverage is to have some support in the covered process and use environment variables. Most programs (shell, Node) propagate the parent environment to the child processes so this is a clean way to pass the info. The environment variable is static though. It means that the covered process must look for it. In the latest Node version, Node looks for `NODE_V8_COVERAGE` to enable coverage and write the results at the end. This method breaks if a child process is created in a fresh environment, but this is pretty rare in practice.

The other solution is to watch the process subtree and intercept the creation of new processes. The library `spawn-wrap` can be used for this. It creates a temporary shim directory with a fake `node` executable. By changing the `PATH` or rewriting the `spawn` calls. This solution also depends on the environment to not be reset. It also uses some temporary files so it's not ideal. Still, this solution allows the most flexibility because you can run arbitrary code and do not need any support from the covered process.

## Coverage results

Once a covered process finishes, it must return its results.
The two main ways to achieve it is via communication channels or by writing the files in an agreed-upon location.

`c8@2` and `c8@3` uses a temporary directory where the files are written. Each process in the subtree writes a file and at the end the root process reads all the files in the directory. It's an easy solution, but it breaks encapsulation: you cannot safely run multiple coverages concurrently if there's a risk that they use the same temporary directory.

`c8@1` and my version use communication channels. Namely, the inspector API. The inspected processes are started in debug mode and the root process establishes an inspector session with them through a direct connection. Using the inspector API not only allows to get the results directly, it also allows to use the inspector to request more data (for example the module type or the source code).

# Comparison

## `c8@1`

- Can only inspect a direct `Node` child process.
- Uses the inspector API.
- No shim directory, no temporary directory, no dependency on the environment.

This version was a good start. It offers the cleanest implementation but the fact that it only support direct sub-process means that it is unusable with many popular test runners.

## `c8@2`

- Can inspect process subtrees
- Uses `spawn-wrap@1`: for each process, starts an inspector on itself, executes main, and on exit synchronously writes the results.
- The results are written in a temporary directory, the files use uuid4 for uniqueness (caused real issues with determinism)
- Requires a shim directory and a temporary results directory.

This version enables a usable CLI tool. It's pretty great. The main issues are that it had some issues when generating the final reports (but it's a seconday issue) and that it left many files around.

## `c8@3`

- Can inspect process subtrees.
- Uses the environment variable `NODE_V8_COVERAGE` and Node's builtin support for coverage.
- The results are written in a temporary directory.
- No shim directory.

The main change in this version is getting rid of `spawn-wrap` and its shim directories by using Node's builtin support. It still uses temporary files, but it should be possible to get implement some solution just to make sure that concurrent coverage does not interfere.

## My current solution

I have a working `c8` version on my `next` branch. It currently relies on unpublished changes in other packages but I'll try to make it available as soon as possible.

- Can inspect process subtrees
- Uses a heavily patched `spawn-wrap` version (""`spawn-wrap@2`""). Allows to establish inspector sessions with any process in a subtree.
- Uses the inspector API: no temporary files, has access to extra data.
- Uses a shim directory.

It still relies unfortunately on shim directories, but it has a direct access to the inspector API for any child process. This is extremely powerful.

## The ideal solution

The ideal solution would have no shims, no temporary directories and grant full access to the inspector API.
This solution would use the inspector API and Node support to detect child processes.
This requires Node support to reverse the dependency between the inspected and inspector process. Currently, the inspected process is started first and then an inspector can connect to it. In our case, we have the opposite: a single root process and many child processes. The idea would be to start an ""inspector server"" and then pass its port through an environment variable. Any new process would then started in ""inspected mode"" and establish a connection with the root process.

This kind of the mechanism is not only useful for coverage, but it could be used by IDEs to support cross-process debugging/break points.

# Comments

I hoped to quickly send a PR my c8 issues and move on to run coverage on my ESM files. I ended up going through a rabbit hole of fixes. Here are some unordered comments.

## `foreground-child`

`foreground-child` is the lib used to display the output of the covered process. It proxys the I/O, IPC and signals of the root process to a child process.

My first issue with this lib is that it takes over control-flow. You can pass a handler to run some code once the child process is closed. You can retake control by not calling the end callback but the API design does not encourage this behavior. It prevents using it in a lib function called multiple times.

My second issue is that the function signature kinda mimicks `child_process.spawn`, but not completely:
```typescript
function foregroundChild(program: string | ReadonlyArray<string>, cb?: CloseHandler): ChildProcess;
function foregroundChild(program: string, args: ReadonlyArray<string>, cb?: CloseHandler): ChildProcess;
function foregroundChild(program: string, arg1: string, cb?: CloseHandler): ChildProcess;
function foregroundChild(program: string, arg1: string, arg2: string, cb?: CloseHandler): ChildProcess;
function foregroundChild(program: string, arg1: string, arg2: string, arg3: string, cb?: CloseHandler): ChildProcess;
function foregroundChild(program: string, arg1: string, arg2: string, arg3: string, arg4: string, cb?: CloseHandler): ChildProcess;
```
`foreground-child` spawns the child process itself: you don't have control over the stream or environment variables. This is the reason why `c8@3` has to [mess with the global environment](https://github.com/bcoe/c8/blob/6cf360197e6887180be4a45c471fad35f669de68/bin/c8.js#L25) as a workaround.

`foreground-child` not only spawns the child process itself, it also uses a different spawn function based on the platform. On windows it uses `cross-spawn`, otherwise the builtin `child_process.spawn`. This is a workaround around the fact that argument parsing is basically broken for processes spawned on Windows and that you can't pass your own options.

It also has an inconsistency regarding the way it proxys IPC compared to signals. It clears all the `message` listeners on the parent process and does not ""unproxify"" its listeners. On the other hand, the signals are well handled IMO by only attaching and detaching its own listeners.

I wrote some patches to address these issues. The main change was to expose an additional function to proxy an existing process instead of spawning a new one. It means that the caller can create th child process however it wants and `foreground-child.proxy` just sets up the various proxys.

## `v8-to-istanbul`

`v8-to-istanbul` is the lib used to convert V8 coverage to `c8` coverage.

At its core, it should be a simple pure transformation from a `ScriptCoverage` (or `FunctionCoverage[]`) to an Istanbul file coverage.

`v8-to-istanbul` reads the files from disk itself. I don't think it should be it's responsibility. It plays badly with mocked FS (such as Gulp's Vinyl) and brings asynchronicity or blocking calls when they are not that needed.

The current version returns an istanbul report (many scripts) when converting V8 coverage for a single script. There is a mismatch.

For commonJS, there is a mismatch between the files on disk and the files evaluated by V8 due to the CJS wrapper (another reason IMO why it shouldn't read the files directly). Some users change the value of this wrapper, for example to inject `""use strict""` to every module. It would be nice to be able to control this behavior.

My main issue is that it uses a line-based approximation to get the number of covered functions, processes and branches. It should use syntax analysis to get proper results. This IMO the reason why I had issues with c8 (wrong results).

In my patches, I refactored `v8-to-istanbul` to focus on the conversion using Babel's parser for syntax analysis. Using my version I am able to get the exact same results as `nyc` for the fixtures in `c8`. It properly handles multiline statements, all kinds of functions and simple branches (I still need to add code for some of the branches like switch/case or logical operators).

## `spawn-wrap`

Ok, this is a hack. But it can be pretty powerful.

First issue: it globally patches Node's internals. This immediately rules out any sort of concurrent calls involving child processes. You should be able to create independent wrapped instances of `child_process`.

The logic to rewrite the intercepted spawn calls is a bit brittle. It relies directly mutates the options and writes some internal values on it. It also uses string concatenation for path manipulation (so it has some bad results for windows). There also some issues around the handling of env variables on Windows.

The wrapper is statically configured. You can enforce some arguments and environment variables, but cannot change them based on the process being spawned (or generate a different value for each child process).

By looking at all the dependents on `npm`, it seems that the API does not really match the need it solves. The need is to spawn some custom module before the real main and pass some data to this custom modules. Using args and env vars is a bit contrived.

I did some major clean up on `spawn-wrap`. It still needs a shim directory, but appart from that I think it's pretty good. It solves the issues above. It also adds some helpers to handle the lifetime shim directory in a stack-based way.

## `c8`

This message is already long so I won't go into the details. I just moved most of the logic to the lib part so the the cli script is just a small wrapper. I refactor the argument parsing/configuration detection so you can use it in a library. I also updated it to use my patched versions of the other libraries.
(Obviously, it gained a first class lib API)

## Types

One of the main pain points when working with all these various libraries was documentation. The public API had a description in the README, but the internals had nothing. It means that finding out the real signature of `foreground-child`, or what are the expected fields in an Istanbul source location, or what are invariants involved in `spawn-wrap`'s transformations was a pain.
I wrote type definitions/converted to Typescript most the libs I touched. Yeah, it adds some transpilation facilities and static checker, but the main benefit is that it pushes you to write a mostly unambiguous documentation for your functions. At the size of `c8`, involving all these dependencies, it pays off.

# What next

I worked on an other projects in the last weeks of August/first weeks of September and couldn't submit all the PRs I had in mind. I wanted to finish them together to be sure that they all play nice with each other.
In the meantime, Node got basic builtin support for coverage and `c8` was updated. It's great, but I still think that there is room for improvement.
In the long term, I truly believe that Node needs a general way to inspect subprocesses, for coverage and debuggers.
Before that, Node's builtin coverage and my lib both have value and tradeoffs. Even the `c8@1` version supporting only direct child processes is valuable: it's most reliable self-contained solution if you only need to inspect a single process.
I think a good way would be to have all 3 versions available in the lib for the moment and I'd like to work on a merge request for this:
- Direct node subprocess with `--inspect=0` and the inspector API
- `NODE_V8_COVERAGE` with temporary files
- ""`spawn-wrap@2`"" with the shim directory but no temporary files (inspector API)

This introduces randomness. This is bad because it prevents reproducible execution in case an issue is found. For example #14 has a bug that depends on the order in which the result files are loaded.

`c8` needs unique names, not random names. Given that `c8` clears its temporary directory every time it runs, a counter should be enough for uniqueness. We could also improve the output slightly by using the url of the test file. Something like:
```js
const digits = (allV8Coverage.length - 1).toString(10).length;
for (let i = 0; i <allV8Coverage.length; i++) {
  const v8 = allV8Coverage[i];

  const fileName = `${i.toString(10).padStart(digits, ""0"")}-${baseName}.json`;

I cannot reproduce it reliably, but it happens about 60% of the time.

I was able to find part of the cause why it happens, but I need help to find the root cause and solve it.

The `lcovonly` report failed [at this line](https://github.com/istanbuljs/istanbuljs/blob/829e658dfa91e3a9533842be9ce940dbe7785c09/packages/istanbul-reports/lib/lcovonly/index.js#L52) because the `branchMap` and `b` properties of the file coverage had different keys. It is a broken invariant, meaning that the coverage map was malformed.

The bad file coverage object was for a file called `test.esm.js`. When looking into c8's tmp directory (`coverage/tmp`), I found two coverage file for `test.esm.js`: [gist](https://gist.github.com/demurgos/b1b1a92f89b9581b004fc700a40c3462).
If you look at them, you see that they have different `branchMap` values. The first one has 2 properties, the second one has 4 properties.

When `c8` builds its coverage map, it merges all the files in its temporary directory. One of the preconditions of the merge function is that if there are two reports for the same file, the file needs to have the same structure (ex. `branchMap`). [https://github.com/istanbuljs/istanbuljs/blob/829e658dfa91e3a9533842be9ce940dbe7785c09/packages/istanbul-lib-coverage/lib/file.js#L246](https://github.com/istanbuljs/istanbuljs/blob/829e658dfa91e3a9533842be9ce940dbe7785c09/packages/istanbul-lib-coverage/lib/file.js#L246).

---

So here is the current state of my investigation: `lcovonly` breaks because it gets an invalid file coverage because multiple reports for the same file but with different structures are merged, thus breaking one of the preconditions of the merge function.

To solve this, c8 should ensure that the reports are unique for each file URL, and that they have the same structure.

_I was shocked when I pulled this feature together by the fact that everything *just worked*_

This raises a couple mysteries:

## Mystery 1

I'm able to output coverage information in the `process.on('exit')` handler:

```js
    // hook process.exit() and common exit signals, e.g., SIGTERM,
    // and output coverage report when these occur.
    onExit(() => {
      session.post('Profiler.takePreciseCoverage', (err, res) => {
        if (err) console.warn(err.message)
        else {
          try {
            const result = filterResult(res.result)
            writeIstanbulFormatCoverage(result)
          } catch (err) {
            console.warn(err.message)
          }
        }
      })
    }, {alwaysLast: true})
```

I was pleasantly surprised to find out that I'm able to call `Profiler.takePreciseCoverage` from within an exit handler; this is a bit shocking to me because you're generally not able to perform async operations within this context (was a workaround for this introduced, in relation to the inspector?).

## Mystery 2

block-level test coverage seems to be working on the canary build of Node.js:

<img width=""1200"" alt=""screen shot 2017-12-17 at 4 24 45 pm"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194609/34085510-d90ccf64-e346-11e7-8ea6-7526801d59ff.png"">

☝️ I'm ecstatic that this is working; but shouldn't it not be working since I'm not spawning with `--inspect-brk`? I was under the impression once the Node process starts we're not able to enable block level coverage.

@hashseed, @TimothyGu @schuay @eugeneo, perhaps you can provide some insight into these mysteries?

Getting detailed coverage in node is currently still a bit tricky, since it requires that the source is reparsed/recompiled after detailed coverage is enabled. 

In Chrome DevTools, that's easy. In Node, not so much. We're looking into ways to make this better :)

- GitHub-markdown changed, or some code-blocks in the README were always broken. Syntax-highlighting was added (only some blocks had it).
- Replaced URLs with new equivalents. For gh-pages, GitHub prefers github.io now. This also affects the homepage URL in the project sidebar, which should be updated by @benvanik.
    I believe this might actually fix #167 .
    *(I had the same issue a couple of days ago, but don't remember how I resolved it - I thought it was the "".com &rarr; .io""-change, but wasn't able to reproduce the issue anymore while writing this PR).*
- I'm not sure if there's a replacement for the Firefox extension or if it even still works when built manually. I removed the dead link to pre-build but kept the rest, assuming it still works.
- I kept the http://learningwebgl.com/ link even though it is currently unavailable. It has been working until some months ago, so chances are it will return.

There are other minor things in the README I'd change, but I'm not even sure if this repository is still maintained.
If it isn't, we should update the README to refer people to alternative tools with equivalent functionality, then archive the repository.
If it is, I'll probably send some follow-ups in the future (documentation and code alike, if there's need).

## Description

The chromium extension makes WebGL context crash after its activation (for one origin), until the browser is restarted.

## Steps
- open chromium 59 with a fresh profile
- install webgl-inspector from the store
- Visit http://www.itowns-project.org/itowns2/examples/globe.html
- activate the chromium console
- activate webgl-inspector

## Expected
- The page still works correctly (you can see the texture on the globe, zoom etc)
- The page can be debugged with webgl-inspector

## Actual
- My computer freeze some seconds, the page crashes with all lot of errors, the first of them being

```
(unknown) Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'createShader' of null

    at SurfaceInspector.TextureView.inspector.setupPreview (<anonymous>:10656:30)
    at <anonymous>:7582:18
```

There are also a lot of warnings seemingly concerning my application (itowns), but I don't have them if I disable this extension. **[Full logs](https://pastebin.com/kFhMbn6R)**

- From this point on, every attempt to load this url will fail until I restart the browser, whether in this tab or another. And it seems it affect the whole origin (because http://www.itowns-project.org/itowns2/examples/3dtiles.html fails too, with other errors:

The issue seems to be if there's more than one webgl context used there are issues. It used to work somewhat though I'm not sure how since the old code would call

    var hostUI = new gli.host.HostUI(result);

For each newly wrapped context suggesting that it made a separate UI per context.

I think that explains why the UI is slightly messed up on this page (http://twgljs.org/)

The reason is there's 2 contexts on the first page, one for webglstats.com and another for the background where as the second page doesn't have webglstats.com

In any case the new issue is that a page that uses both webgl and webgl2 has big issues because all the windows/tabs/etc make a context and that context has to be compatible with whatever they're inspecting.

It's making me wonder how much I should refactor or if I should start over or what. I went through and tried to fix the webgl/webgl2 issue but then realized that won't fix it because the code currently expects it's inspecting one context. All the tabs/windows etc get passed the one context they are inspecting. To make it work with multiple contexts seems like there would need to be some global object or something that gets passed around the inspector uses to know which context is being displayed in the UI and then a drop down or something to let you select contexts.

Or I could just make it inspect only one context. In that case thought maybe it should generate a warning or alert (can't inspect multiple contexts) or maybe it should just inspect the first one with a warning or alert on any past that and not inspect them.

This brings up another issue in that the inspector makes lots of contexts. At least one for each BufferPreview, another for each TexturePreview, another for each SurfaceInspector. At the moment I think it makes at least 8 contexts. Since the browser only allows a limited number before it starts losing the context on old ones I'm wondering if the UI should just use one extra context every where if possible. I guess the hard part there is each of those UI elements has it's own canvas so there's probably no easy work around for that short of using one offscreen context and using 2d canvases in all those elements then render to the offscreen canvas and copy.

Here's another idea, only inspect 1 context but in some options somewhere let you select which one gets inspected. The easiest would be by number, the first one created would get inspected but you could set it to 2nd or 3rd etc. The issue there is with so much being async order might not be predictable. It probably is most of the time though so maybe that would be enough",NA,FALSE,https://api.github.com/repos/benvanik/WebGL-Inspector,https://api.github.com/repos/benvanik/WebGL-Inspector/issues/154/labels{/name},https://api.github.com/repos/benvanik/WebGL-Inspector/issues/154/comments,https://api.github.com/repos/benvanik/WebGL-Inspector/issues/154/events,https://github.com/benvanik/WebGL-Inspector/issues/154,NA

If you're unaware, uniform block objects allow uniforms to be stored in buffers. The issue is that basically anything can write to a buffer, using transform feedback you could have a shader write to a buffer. You can also use PBOs to transfer texture data to/from a buffer. As it is now I think you save all buffer updates whereas uniforms are only saved for a specific frame. But, once you put uniforms in buffers those buffers will be updated every single frame, saving all data for all frames seems bad. We'd run out of memory pretty quick.

There's now `getBufferSubData` to get data out of a buffer so maybe we could use that on the capture frame only? I'm not sure. You can also get texture data out of a buffer using PBOs. I guess I could make it so that on capture I get the data for uniforms using `getBufferSubData` and on playback I can use `getBufferSubData` to save the data currently in the buffer, then put the captured data into the buffer, then put the data that was there back.

I'm not sure that would really work. The buffer may have changed size. I could just use a hidden shadow buffer for uniforms and or everything else but it would require lots of remapping.

Or maybe the inspector just can't work with uniform buffer objects. As it is it saves `bufferData` and `bufferSubData` data but it's kind of assuming those are not called that often (right?) There's no way to tell beforehand if the data being put in is for vertices or for uniforms or something else. Also back to the transform feedback issue the inspector would have to save buffers after every transform feedback call to produce the right playback.

Ugh, now that I think about it making it work is going to be pretty hard. 

Maybe capturing all buffer uploads should be an option. It's nice to be able to see all the calls to bufferData or bufferSubData for a particular buffer but given all that stuff above it should like capturing the uploads might need be the exception and otherwise just use `getBufferSubData` during capture.

Another big change is buffer bind target no longer = buffer type. All the code assumes there's 2 buffer types, ARRAY_BUFFER and ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER but now there are 8 targets but only 2 buffer types, ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER, and ""other"".  You can bind the same buffer to all other 7 targets. They're just bind points for what the buffer will be used for, not it's type.

Anyway I'm not sure how the inspector should handle any of this. Like noticing how it currently needs to save the state of everything for playback means debugging things with video textures or dynamic textures is also problematic. Maybe it should be saving a snapshot of the data and track if things have been updated so it knows on the next capture if it needs new copies or can use the old ones.

Anyway, just thinking out loud but would love to hear thoughts.

Sorry this is such a huge PR. I started on WebGL2 then decided to use AMD and got things dependent on each others.

This commit switches to AMD for the module system and uses webpack/babel
to build lib/gli.all.js. This means you can use ES6 code in the source
and it should be converted to ES5. It also means there's no need to
add files to both the loaded and the buildscript as webpack can
figure out the files. You need to have node.js installed, probably at least version 4 (stable/LTS)

Note the buildscript now runs webpack, it also installs npm modules. Like the firefox extension sdk this will take a minute or so the first time you run it. After that it should be fast.

WebGL 2 can be instantiated with the string `webgl2` (and, less commonly, `experimental-webgl2`). It's possible to get WebGL-Inspector to enable its UI by adding `webgl2` to the list in `embed.js` (which allows one to inspect state, textures, etc), but I wonder if there's any additional work that needs to be done to actually support it?

Thanks!

Edit: I played around with it a bit more. Although simply having the UI to inspect what it can is immensely more useful than not, here's the (very incomplete) list of things I've noticed are missing:
- The inspector is unaware of all new consts, like the new internal formats, uniform buffer stuff, etc. and displays them as something similar to `?? 0x8a11 ??` as opposed to `UNIFORM_BUFFER` (The [WebGL developer tools](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/WebGLDeveloperTools)'s `glEnumToString` might be a future-proof way to solve this issue)
- The texture display doesn't show meaningful output for the new [sized internal formats](https://www.khronos.org/opengles/sdk/docs/man3/html/glTexImage2D.xhtml) (scroll down to ""Table 2"") that are not color renderable.
  - Since we can attach textures as the depth/stencil target(s) for a framebuffer, we can have depth and stencil textures like this
- The ""Buffers"" tab doesn't seem to handle buffers related to draw calls using uniform buffers well.

One such thing is creating a hash of all available methods like so:

``` javascript

    // First, filter the methods into an array
    gl[i].bind && tmp.push(i)
}
for (i in tmp.sort()) {
    // Then map the sorted methods into the array
    gl[i] = gl[tmp[i]].bind(gl)

This code injects its own new properties (numeric indices) in a deterministic manner, which satisfies a need for additional minification. E.g.:

``` javascript
gl[0] === gl.activeTexture
gl[3] === gl.bindBuffer
gl[101] === gl.texImage2D
// ... etc
```

When the inspector is enabled, the context returned to the application is given a lot of new enumerable properties, which breaks the determinism of the above code. (The code itself is not deterministic, as it relies on a vanilla WebGL context.)

Some examples of the new enumerable properties are:

``` javascript
gl.captureCallback
gl.errorMap
gl.rawgl // oh hey, it's the original context that I wanted originally
gl.enabledExtensions
// ...
```

WebGL Inspector has not worked properly with PlayCanvas for such a long time now. :( So I've just spent a little time looking into why. Seems to be related to the value of drawingBufferWidth/Height.

However, when running with WebGL Inspector, drawingBufferWidth/Height are 300 and 150 respectively (which I believe is the default width and height of a canvas as creation time. So when I activate WebGL Inspector on a PlayCanvas app/game, the canvas is 300x150 in the lower left of the tab. Any idea why this might be happening?

See here for a test app to run with and without WebGL Inspector:

What happens is that embed.js calls `insertScript` to get all the `gli` code in, but that code is not synchronous.

Later on, embed.js monkey-patches the `HTMLCanvasElement` prototype's `getContext` and introduces a reference to the `gli` variable.

If someone decides to create a context before `gli.all.js` has loaded, the `gli` resolves to null, and the block in lines 116--119 will always throw exceptions. No contexts ever created! :(

There doesn't seem to be a simple way to solve this besides. Perhaps `getContext` should throw a special ""come back later"" exception? 

Fundamentally, it's not enough to assume that `embed.js` was included before anything else, because script tag insertion is async.

Thinking about this more.. texture history now seems to be tracked for the entire texture, but it needs to be tracked for each mip level of the texture.  So:
- every texImage2D call, per mip level
- every texSubImage2D per mip level since the last texImage2D for that mip level
- if generateMipmaps is called, all history other than mip level 0 should be thrown away (and the call to generateMipmaps should be indicated)

We at [VersionEye](https://www.versioneye.com/signup?promo_code=BOWER) are working hard to keep up the quality of the bower's registry.

We just finished our initial analysis of the quality of the Bower.io registry:

**7530** - registered packages, _224_ of them doesnt exists anymore;

We analysed **7306**  existing packages and  **1070** of them don't have bower.json on the master branch ( _that's where a Bower client pulls a data_ ).

Sadly, your library `benvanik/WebGL-Inspector` is one of them.

Can you spare **15** minutes to help us to make Bower better?

Just add a new file `bower.json` and  change attributes.

```
{
  ""name"": ""benvanik/WebGL-Inspector"",
  ""version"": ""1.0.0"",
  ""main"": ""path/to/main.css"",
  ""description"": ""please add it"",
  ""license"": ""Eclipse"",
  ""ignore"": [
    "".jshintrc"",
    ""**/*.txt""
  ],
  ""dependencies"": {
    ""<dependency_name>"": ""<semantic_version>"",

    ""<dependency_name>"": ""<package>""
  },
  ""devDependencies"": {
    ""<test-framework-name>"": ""<version>""
  }
}

```

Read more about bower.json [on the official spefication](http://bower.io/#defining-a-package) and nodejs [semver](https://github.com/isaacs/node-semver#ranges) library has great examples of proper versioning.

**NB!** Please _validate_ your bower.json with _jsonlint_ before commiting your updates.

Thank you!

Currently Inspector doesn't work with dart js-generated files out of the box. This is because dart use obj.constructor.name property for resolving types and CaptureContext's property currently returns empty string.

``` javascript
var CaptureContext = function(canvas, rawgl, options) {
  ...
}

to

function CaptureContext(canvas, rawgl, options) {

I also know the code is not faulty because it works on my old Dell machine, as well as on my Galaxy S8.  I am currently using Chrome 59.0.3071.115 (Official Build) (64-bit) (cohort: Stable), and it is not working for this.

First of all, congratulations for your project. It' amazing. I#ve read a few things and I already tested this piece of code :

setInterval(function() {

    $('#flipbook').turn('page', 1);
 } else {
    $('#flipbook').turn('next');
 }
}, 3000);

Works perfectly! The pages are flipping until it reaches the end of the book then come back to the first page.

What I would like to do is : when the page is auto turning, I would like to get the same effect as when we click on the bottom corner. The ""soft"" movement when you turn the page yourself.

Is it possible to get that when auto flipping?

I'm curious if there is a way to make the entire page hoverable (to reveal the corner) and clickable (to turn the page), as opposed to the default behavior which acts only when the mouse is close to the corner(s)?

My hunch is that there is a simple way to do this, say, somewhere in turn.js that sets the hoverable and clickable areas relative to the width and height of the page?

Thanks!
Craig

You website doesn't make it clear that a commercial license is required to use it in a commercial setting, in the License section of your site, it does say ""This license doesn't include features of the 4th release."" with a link, if I click the link, it just takes me to the home page again.

Version 4 appears to be freely available on the website, however there are inconsistencies on whether a license applies for commercial use (for either version 3 or version 4):
- The Download link on the website links to version 4, just above the Github link
- The licensing comment on the website (http://turnjs.com/#licensing) refers to a BSD license and states the project is available on Github, however it also states that the license doesn't cover the version 4 release (the link to the v4 release PDF appears to be broken)
- The version 4 download ZIP contains no licensing information, however it does refer to the 'commercial version' in the API docs contained within
- The Github page states version 3 is available under 'a non-commercial BSD license'
- In this issue - https://github.com/blasten/turn.js/issues/61 - the author states commercial use is ok with an MIT license
- In this issue - https://github.com/blasten/turn.js/issues/342 - the author states commercial use requires purchasing a license

There are a number of open issues covering licensing, these include:
- https://github.com/blasten/turn.js/issues/491

- https://github.com/blasten/turn.js/issues/486

- https://github.com/blasten/turn.js/issues/287

From these, it appears the author is no longer supporting the project nor responding to issues or e-mails; however he is still active on Twitter (https://twitter.com/blasten). He now appears to work for Google.

Last month he asked a Twitter user to contact him by e-mail to enquire about licensing (https://twitter.com/blasten/status/698610530538254336).

I've e-mailed Emmanuel enquiring about licensing for a commercial project and haven't heard back; I've just tweeted him today and will update this issue if I hear back from him.

If anyone else knows what the correct licensing status of this project is, please do share!

If i comment it out, then the zoom in works fine.. but i am unable to zoom-out.

I've made a small modification to included script magazine.js in such way that it's using images from another domain (e.g. pages are at http://site/...) not from pages folder, and it's working nice.

Script is working a bit slower which is quite understandable, so I was wondering is there a way to somehow change the script behavior regarding image loading for instance to preload few images ""around"" for current page (e.g.  page-1, PAGE, page+1)?

I'm having troubles getting the zoom function right for double-page images. I convert a PDF to images before loading into turn.js. De PDF consists of a front page, followed by double pages per image, closing with on back-page. So the images are like this:
image 1-> front page
image 2 -> page 1&2
image 3-> page 3&4 etc
last image -> single back page

With the scissor method I'm able to display the magazine properly. However, the zooming function only seems to work on the single-page images (so in my case, only the front and back). 

What happens when zooming in the double pages, is that the image get's smaller, showing the image twice, only smaller in the top corner. Now, an option would be to split those double-page images into single images. But I would prefer to keep it the way it is, because I have a feeling I'm missing something small here to make it work with double-page images as well. 

So does anyone know how to fix this?

Zooming in the double page, looks like this:

Please check the above image. As you can see, the first page contains 2 image upload areas and second page with one. I used croppic ( http://www.croppic.net/) for this feature. The problem is that It works only for first page and and for first time only. And we can add as many instances of the plugin in the first page it works. But the upload/crop plugin instance on the second page do not work. And if we turn the page, first page instances also get not working. We tried it with other plugins also and the result was same. If we remove turn.js all instances of upload work fine. We find it difficult to recognize the error as there are no errors displayed in the console panel.

Even though it says that pages up to 70 have loaded successful there only 10 pages from 70 displayed properly. Also when i tour inside the flip-book towards and backwards i get random images displayed and some of them not. So is this a cache memory problem that can't load all images?

I read that  .addPage  can solve the problem. Do i need to delete every page i add so that the memory still work properly? And if so, the users want to visit one specific page, is that page going to be added again? Also i made a menu in flip-book so that the user can access the group of elements he wants to observe (for example page 150) in order to avoid turning pages for a long time.

So is .addPage solving the problem or the problem still occurs? If not, is there any other suggestion in order to get this flip-book working? Is there a way to include a PDF file and generate every page seperately?

I disabled extensions thinking that was an issue, but that is not the case.
Mainly, it seems the Zoom feature specifically when an OnClick Is triggered for the Zoom on the page itself, the page does not zoom.

I used the Turn.js v3 bible demo to get a working version of Turn.js for our website.  Our website is a .net 4.0 web application.  I am using a web service to load the flipbook when the page loads.  It works great, but I also needed the ability to clear out the flipbook and reload the book with filtered pages from the user picking a category from a drop down list box.  So we bought the v4 of Turn.js for the support and the ability to destroy the flipbook and reload it with the filtered pages from the web service.  Here is what the page looks like (I don’t have the category dropdown on this screenshot, and it’s not relevant at this point to getting the new version of turn.js to work):

The web service returns HTML that is then added as a page in the flipbook.  When I copied the new turn.js v4 into the project, the flipbook doesn’t work anymore.  I am attaching the files that I am currently using.  
Here is the scenario:
1.  I open the page.
2.  The book doesn’t have the pages loaded and the page text box is blank.
3.  I type 1 into the page text box and it loads the first page, but I get this error in my browser console:  “Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'data' of undefined “, on line 1259 of turn.js.  

Are there some key differences between v3 and v4 of Turn.js?  Mostly I need a better understanding of how to load the flipbook correctly. 

Thank you,

wouldn't it be nice to have a `exclude` option to let the user specify elements inside the turn container that have not to be transformed and treated as page?
alternatively, if you prefer, it could also be `elements` or `items` and behaves in the opposite way.

this parameter could accept a DOM element, a well-formed jQuery selector, a jQuery object or a function that returns any of the latter value.

a concrete case: i need to have some extra elements with `position: absolute` inside the book and rely on its `position: relative`, page placement and size to accurately position them. my current workaround is: write them outside the book and, only after turnjs has been initalized, execute a relocation inside the book with `.append()`.

what do you think?

P.S: besides, it would also be delicious to leverage on a new event fired when the initialization of the book is completed, something like `initialized` or `init`.

We at [VersionEye](https://www.versioneye.com/signup?promo_code=BOWER) are working hard to keep up the quality of the bower's registry.

We just finished our initial analysis of the quality of the Bower.io registry:

**7530** - registered packages, _224_ of them doesnt exists anymore;

We analysed **7306**  existing packages and  **1070** of them don't have bower.json on the master branch ( _that's where a Bower client pulls a data_ ).

Sadly, your library `blasten/turn.js` is one of them.

Can you spare **15** minutes to help us to make Bower better?

Just add a new file `bower.json` and  change attributes.

```

Read more about bower.json [on the official spefication](http://bower.io/#defining-a-package) and nodejs [semver](https://github.com/isaacs/node-semver#ranges) library has great examples of proper versioning.

Using the Chrome timeline I was able to measure it at ~2.24 seconds on my 2012 Macbook Air. Running the same operation on a new iPad (iOS6) takes about 14 seconds. Looking in the timeline, there is a whole bunch of rendering calls to Recalculate Style and Layout.

![screen shot 2013-08-02 at 14 42 58](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/26971/901192/967d68d4-fb79-11e2-893d-6ff13969ad2f.png)

Can this be done more efficiently by batching the style changes so that the browser isn't forced to do a layout after each one? Or possibly batching the removal of pages by using something like `$('#book').turn('removePage', [2,3,4,5,6,7,8..])`.

From quickly debugging what's going on it seems that the issue might be the repeated calls to `_pageSize()` (stack trace: `turnMethods.removePage -> turnMethods._movePages -> move -> _pageSize()`) which calls the `$.fn.width()` and `$.fn.height()` height methods (which force a style recalculation).

Can you advise if there are any hacks that you can think of to make this faster? Also, is this something that you think will be improved in an upcoming release?

But I can't flip to page two with drag&drop. But I CAN use the arrow keys to flip the first page. After that I can use the mouse. Why is that and how to fix it?

Another problem is that the pages are flipping back the first time I release the drag to turn to the next page (it looks like the animation is starting from the beginning once I release the mouse button).

1) Does IE8 support flipping effect? Will you fix it in the future?
2) Does IE9 support hard effect? Will you fix it in the future?
3) Except Chrome, all of the browsers aren't displayed the tab icon. Is the problem belonging to CSS? or it not support yet?

In evaluting turn.js for my project, it quickly became apparent that it did not 'work' with jQueryMobile.  I seems that another user found this out a while ago, but gave up on the tool.  I decided to dig into the issue and found the main problem:

All of the 'pages' (outer DIVs) of a book are supposed to have a class of 'page-wrapper'.  However, with jQueryMobile (jQM) in the mix, they all end up getting a class of 'page-wrapper  ui-page ui-body-c'.  Those extra classes result in pages 'disappearing', and thus ruining the books.

I could not debug this, but either Emmanuel is putting in his class value first, and jQM is appending their classes afterwards, or, jQM is setting their classes to the DIVs and Emmanuel is prepending his class afterwards.  I suspect the former.

In any case, I have two pieces of code that seem to make things good.  These are 'work-arounds', and not necessarily solutions that Emmanuel might offer:
1. In the 'document ready' event, add the following line of code AFTER you 'construct' your book:
   $('div.page-wrapper').attr('class','page-wrapper');

That line essentially re-sets the class of all 'page-wrapper' DIVs to simply 'page-wrapper' (thus erasing the two extra classe the jQM added).
1.  For books with more than 6 pages, bind an event handler for the book that watches for DIVs with the page-wrapper class being added to the DOM:
   
   $(document).on(""DOMNodeInserted"", ""#flipbook > div.page-wrapper"", function(event){
       setTimeout(""$('#flipbook > div.page-wrapper').attr('class','page-wrapper')"",100);
   });

That code essentially re-sets the class value for each object that Emmanuel injects or re-injects into the DOM (remember, for books with more than 6 pages, he removes and re-adds pages as the user flips between them).  My 'selector' includes the ID of the book.  If you have only one book on your page, you do not need to worry about that.  I will have more than one and thus do not want to query or touch objects that are not changing.  I tried multiple ways to reset the class values, especially using the incoming 'event' object (and its 'target' attribute) however none seemed to work very well.  On the whole, my approach is not the most efficient, but is not terribly poor either.  But again, I have asked Emmanuel to investigate and respond.

Please let me know what you all think.

Thanks,

-David

I am using version 4.  I am attempting to keep the outside cover pages (which are larger than the inside pages, visible once the book is open.  I am using Wordpress and have it working, but the covers disappear.

I tried to use the code you offered in issue #147 to dynamically apply the .fixed class with no luck.  I'm no javascript ninja, so it's possible I'm missing something simple.

The turn.js uses .page as a class identifier for the pages, which clashes with magento's base layout templates, which also uses .page as the main wrapper to pages in its core templates, and stylesheets.

Suggest to make the .page class use in turn.js less generic, such as .turn-page

I have a project which uses TurnJS and Uploadifive (http://www.uploadify.com), and there appears to be a conflict. Without Uploadifive, TurnJS works perfectly, however once I put an instance of Uploadifive into a div which forms a TurnJS page, then Uploadifive does not work, though TurnJS still works fine.

I have confirmed it is a conflict, by moving the Uploadifive instance outside of the TurnJS controlled divs, and it works as expected. As of now, the only solution I have had is to place the Uploadifive instance in a separate html page, and use an <iframe>, thus my conclusion is, when TurnJS modifies the DOM, it modifies the Uploadifive instance such that it breaks. I am still playing with the order of execution to see if I can find a simple solution, though hoping someone here can suggest something

I am _not_ using the Responsive FlipBook Plugin - I tried it but it wasn't quite what i'm looking for.

I've managed to piece together the following from the Bible example and PHP to Javascript tutorials that I have found. I know a little bit of html/php/js but i'm by no means an expert.

I'm making it a plugin (again my first) which creates a new Custom Post Type (Leaves) where the intention is that each Leaf is a page in the flipbook. I'm passing the CPT title and content through to my populatePages script (which is based on the Bible example) and using it to populate the pages.

<b>Problem:</b> I'm getting an 'Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'page_title' of undefined' error in my populatePages.js file. This also shows for the page_content if I remove the line showing the title. This may be the cause of the other issue I am seeing:

<b>Problem/Symptom</b>I'm finding that the content on the last page is not shown (there was an issue with the first page also but i've just now discovered that this was due to an extra element in the HTML of the template page). 

FYI with 4 Custom Post Types the book goes cover/page1, page2/page3, page4/backcover. The pages are also out of order which I believe is to do with this being an object rather than an array but I am unsure how to change that. (Of course, I also haven't considered what will happen if the content is bigger than a single page but one thing at a time!)

Can anyone point me in the right direction?

I only have the site locally at the moment using Mamp, however here is the code:

I´m stuck at a certain point – the div class=""magazine zoom-in"" that is shown blue in my  screenshot has a width of 2214 and a height of 1568px. I found this value in the magazine.js (function largeMagazineWidth()…). 

The problem is that the zoomed image is not visible completely, at the bottom there are about 30px of the large image missing when I scroll around. I can see the bottom while scrolling around, but when I stop pressing the mouse button / swiping on the iPad it jumps back ""out of sight"".

By manually changing the height in firebug to 1630px I can get it working, but even though I know the return value from the magazine.js is needed in one part of the index.html (max: function() { return largeMagazineWidth()/$('.magazine').width(); …) I can´t find the place where I can edit the height value. 

All is fine in the magazine example, but our magazine has different dimensions and a different aspect-ratio.

Maybe someone has an idea?
Thanks!

However it does not slow down when I manually curl a page by dragging it, it becomes slow again only when I release and the flipbook turns to a previous or next page. The animation is smooth when the page curl returns to the current page.

By making some profiling it seems calling $(flipbook).turn('page', pageIndex); invokes a lot of jQuery events. My two cents is that the bottleneck feels like the jQuery event propagation mechanisms and event handlers. ( versus animation limitations )

When trying my current Turnjs project on Chrome (version 25.0.1364.172 m) on Windows 8 nothing Turnjs does seems to work. There is no curley corner, pages don't flip. No events seem to arrive anywhere. Also, as reported in issue 81, your own demos don't work. No errors are thrown.

If I send an initial page with the $.turn() function the correct page does appear, but no interaction with the book is possible.

I'm sorry I can't be more specific, and for customer-specific reasons I can't share my project now, but as your own demos won't work I hope you'll be able to resolve this issue asap, or can get back to me with an ETA for a fix.

There seems to be an issue when the direction is rtl and i'm using scissor.js.
The solution would be to flip the order of the two double pages.

Since Turn.js and Scissor.js are not fully integrated i'd suggest a new option in Turn.js which would be called Double Class

for example:

```
$('#flipbook').turn({doubleClass: ""double""});
```

What this code would do is call scissor.js on elements with selected class, then (if the direction is rtl) it will reverse the order of the two parts of the element so that the order would become correct.

This might be a convenient solution instead of coding the solution manually for each project.

Payd customer here ;o) - Anyway, we are building a catalogue using turn.js right now and have an ege-case scenario here it seems. The client wants us to have a video that spans two pages on one of the spreads in the magazine.

I first tried just inserting two pages and then have the video element on the first page - My thinking was that with z-indexing, absolute positioning and sizing I could force the video on top of both pages and have it cover both. This did not work (of course) as turn.js imposes strict overflow hidden on pages.

Next I tried looking at scissor, but that just duplicates my video element and I still only have video visible / playing on the first page.

My next approach was to just have it on one page, set own-size, specify a double width for that page and when the user turns I apply $(this).turn(""display"", ""single""); - This sort of works, but I loose my next/prev arrows due to the (even stricter) overflow hidden applied by turn.js, and then when I go onwards to the next page everything is messed up, as the internal page count doesn't match the catalogue layout - a simple example:

page 1 - page 2 & 3 - page 4&5 as one page - page 6

That internally translates to:

index 1  - index 2 - index 3 - index 4 - index 5

Here turn.js will show the cover page fine and auto center, next spread is shown fine as two pages (index 2 & 3), next my combined single page spread is shown fine but when going to page 6 it shows both my single page and the last (back) page (index 4 and 5)

This is also very wrong and broken. So my ultimate question is:

Is there any ""correct"" way I can overlay an element across two pages?

In the magazine example the flipbook is positioned centrally and is dynamically re-sized to match the browser window size, with browser scrollbars disabled. However I need to allow the use of browser scrollbars, and have the flipbook placed in a fixed position in relation to other content (custom navigation menu). 

If a browser window is partially sized (or fully sized at a lower screen resolution) and the CSS is modified from the below to use fixed position for the top and left (with the re-size viewport call left out) - any part of the flipbook out of sight will adopt the current browser window's bounds. So when you scroll down with the browser scrollbars it will leave only the portion of the flipbook taking up the initial browser window's size visible e.g. chops off the bottom of the flipbook or the sides when you scroll outside the initial load area. 

.magazine-viewport .container{
position:absolute;
top:50%;
left:50%;
}

I'd like the flipbook to be able to load in a static position with a fixed size and if a user's browser is not maximised - allow the user to still be able to see flipbook content outside of the bounds of the initial window. 

Any help much appreciated.

I am considering purchasing a (4th release) license for turn.js, however I do have a few questions:
1.  It seems you have not open-sourced the newest release of turn.js? Will we get the full source code when we purchase a commercial license? This is important for us, because we will in all likelihood need to make some modifications to the script to work for our scenario.
2.  The order page only talks about a license for ‘up to 5 domains’. Our HTML5 application would also be distributed for offline usage (packaged with XULRunner probably) and as a hybrid app for iOS and Android. What kind of license would we need?
3.  There is a jarring visual glitch on all iOS devices we have tried (iPad 1/3, iOS 5/6, iPhone 4S, iPod Touch 4th gen), and it manifests with all demos on turnjs.com: after each page turn, the left page will flicker back to the previous page briefly, then return to the new page. It only fully goes away after turning all pages once. It is 100% reproducible for me on all devices. This glitch really breaks the effect of the page turns, so at this point it seems it is not fully ready yet for iPad/iPhone use? Or is this fixed in the latest release?
4.  Performance is good on IE9 and iOS, but the page turn animation gets quite choppy on Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Opera and Safari (latest builds, all on Windows 8 x64). Safari is slightly better than the rest. Again, looking at the demos on turnjs.com. It happens especially when zooming in. For our needs would need to display books fullscreen, maximum size. This is also manifest on fast desktop machines with good video cards. Looking at the CSS through Web Inspector, it seems no 3d hardware accelerated CSS3 transforms are used? Is this different in turnjs 4th release? If the animation is too slow to use full-screen, we cannot really use it. Of course we would check beforehand if a browser supports GPU acceleration, if not, we would default to a simple fade animation.

Looking forward to your answers and using your wonderful script!

I was wondering, is there any way (in the latest version of turn.js, not the one on github) to completely disable the page turn altogether? I've been struggling with this for quite awhile now, so I figured I would ask –– I did try to use the ""stop"" method as well as doing some other tricky things. 

In fact, was curious if it was also possible to disable the ""hover"" effect that lifts the pages? We are using next / previous arrows to turn the pages and are doing some pretty complex interactions on click so it would be great to disable this.

Let me know if you can––and thanks for the wonderful, wonderful work!

i'm trying to integrate the turn.js 4 via the nextgen gallery plugin for wordpress.

i got it to work, altough, the loadPage function loads a new page from a specific folder on the host.

i inserted the loading function and zooming events into the ""gallery-view.php"" and made a change to the ""img.attr"" source as follows:

function loadPage(page, pageElement) {

```
// Create an image element

var img = $('<img />');

img.mousedown(function(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
});

img.load(function() {

    // Set the size
    $(this).css({width: '100%', height: '100%'});

    // Add the image to the page after loaded

    $(this).appendTo(pageElement);

    // Remove the loader indicator

    pageElement.find('.loader').remove();
});

// Load the page


img.attr('src', '<?php echo $image->thumbnailURL ?>'); 

loadRegions(page, pageElement);
```

}

<?php echo $image->thumbnailURL ?> -  is a nextgen's call for the thumb

well, the problem is that it puts only the LAST image i have uploaded ON ALL PAGES.
same with the zoom in function only calling for "" $image->imageURL""

please please help me to solve this.

I would like the displayed page numbers to start after the table of contents. I have it almost working here: www.professorleonidas.com/livro/offset (see script here: http://www.professorleonidas.com/livro/wp-content/themes/professorleonidas/script-offset.js)

Using the arrow keys you can see the hash changing to reflect the page numbers displayed on each page. This comes from adding a simple offset to the turning function:

`var pageoffset = page - 7;
Hash.go('page/' + pageoffset).update();`

However this is obviously flawed as when you go to www.professorleonidas.com/livro/offset/#page/7 it jumps to page 0 and not page 7.

Any tips for a better solution?

I have an animation on the page which I would like to stop when the user is dragging a corner.
As I understand, it is not the ""turning"" event which happens after the corner is released, and it is not the ""turned"" event which happens after the turn is over.

I am looking for one event that is triggered when the user clicks a corer and starts dragging, and the second is event which is triggered when the user releases the corner after a short drag so the page doesn't flip.
This way I could pause the animation on page and continue it if the page was eventually not flipped.

The problem I am having, and cannot solve, is that the clicks work on the first page, but, as soon as I turn more than 1 page, all links stops working.

Any items on pages after the first page will not work once the page has been turned. 

To check if this was an error on my end, I deleted everything in the book (including the FancyBox pop up) and put a few pages with a link on each page. If I only use a tags with a href then everything is working fine. But as soon as I try to capture the click events using jQuery, everything breaks.

The strange thing is all hover effects and CSS is working fine on the links. Its just the click event that does not get tracked after the page turn in jQuery.

1) I'm trying to force a user to use the drag method of turning a page and disable the auto-turning of a page on mouseup, so a user would have to drag the page to turn it to the next one – and the click would be totally disabled. Is there a clever way of doing that?

first of all congrats for such an amazing library; I've got couple of questions here;
1. Can You explain to me how the script does handle ""depth"" of currently turned page?
   Is it css's z-index or css3 transform-z? All i like to do here is to keep the regions at the top of the stack all the time (put them at the top immediately after releasing corner). What should i do?
2. Playing around with demos at your site with IE8 & IE9 does not showing regions (demo: magazine1) This is a little bit strange but running the magazine1 demo locally, from disk it works well. Regions and visible and clickable. The only error thrown by online version in ie is: error: CSS3114: @font-face failed OpenType embedding permission check. Permission must be Installable. DistTh___.ttf
   I believe it does have nothing to do with an issue.
3. Next question is somehow connected to previous both, It takes place at every browser at the zoom view. I move cursor up on the region and begin dragging. Afrer drag i release mouse button and page does stops but also it runs the actinon binded to the region. Is there any way to disable it? I mean to disable region action after dragging while it still would work on click or tap?

I am not posting a JSfiddle, cuz it's nothing to post

I would like to buy this script but to be honest am not sure if configuring it will be beyond me. I currently work with a flash version but want to upgrade to a jquery one. I have some questions which will hopefully let me decide. 

Firstly is it possible to use image and link map links. What I mean is clicking an area to display a pop up image or open a new web window with the link address (they are the most important things). If it is possible then I would need code examples on how to do this - at the moment I am very visual with little code knowledge. 

Secondly is it possible to configure things like turning off zoom and resize, I would prefer one size and browser window scroll bars. Also, I don't want menu items etc initially. 

Last question. Is it possible (and easy) to add a navigation page if I need to? Something like naming pages with anchors so that if future updates to a publication occur the navigation doesn't go out of sync. 

If possible I would appreciate a quick reply:-)

Thanks 

Andrew

When I view the page it just animates to the last page, no waiting or animation for the first page.

I have read this - https://github.com/blasten/turn.js/issues/171

But the solution isn't working for my project. 
There only ever is 4 pages so I need the code to wait 3 seconds and then flip to the middle pages then wait say 5 seconds and move onto the last page.

Is this possible? 

Thanks very much.

I'm currently working on making my flipbook responsive and felt I'd share my progress with the community in case there's another person out there doing the same thing. (there's a few issue threads here on the subject, but no real code pertaining to it) I'm just starting this process and expect a lot of speed bumps along the way...

here's how i'm handling screen orientation detection:

``` javascript
window.onorientationchange = detectIOSOrientation;  

function checkOrientation (orientation){
        if ( orientation == 0 || orientation == 180)  {
        return(""portrait"");
    }
    else if ( orientation == 90  || orientation == -90) {
        return(""landscape"");
    }


}   

function detectIOSOrientation () {

     switch(checkOrientation(orientation)){
        case ""portrait"" : 
             $('.turn-book').turn('display', 'single').turn('size', 480, 1200);
             $("".importPage"").show();
        break;

        case ""landscape"" : 
             $('.turn-book').turn('display', 'double').turn('size', 960, 600);
             $("".importPage"").hide();
        break;


     }

 }

```

the .importPage class is my right hand page. it's a little redundant, but i haven't thought of a cleaner way of doing this yet. (my pages are dynamic) I hide/show this div class based on the orientation of the device...

which required a quick fix to the prev/next functions:

``` javascript
function goPrev() {

     switch(checkOrientation(orientation)){
        case ""portrait"" : 
             $('.turn-book').turn('previous').turn('previous');
        break;

        case ""landscape"" : 
            $('.turn-book').turn('previous');
        break;

     }

    event.preventDefault();

    return false;
}

function goNext() {

         switch(checkOrientation(orientation)){
        case ""portrait"" : 
             $('.turn-book').turn('next').turn('next');
        break;

        case ""landscape"" : 
            $('.turn-book').turn('next');
        break;
     }

    event.preventDefault();
    return false;
}

```

issues i'm currently facing:

1) need to check orientation on page load
2) swapping between orientations causes glitches in backgrounds of the book (when using css to generate a background as seen in the steve jobs example)
3) swapping between orientations will cause the flipbook to end up off screen and unreachable. 

Any ways, I'm done for the day with this, but thought this might be a popular topic for others and felt I'd at least share what I got done today :)

If any one has any insight I'm 100% open to it, and I hope this may help others reach their goals for their flip books!

I found the function in the magazine.js. How could we modify this to use our large images that are matched in the HTML to the pages that get zoomed. Would it be a (data) or (rel) attribute on the images?

function loadLargePage(page, pageElement) {

A refresh usually sorts it, but it could then re-occur to another page.

My loading function is only a temp one with no error checking, I've not looked in to a fix yet and as it's randomly occurring with consistent markup I have no idea as to the cause [he said helpfully],

Great plugin I must say!! Definitely going to use it in my latest project.

The two pages that have the class fixed are used to create front and back covers (a spine to the book), similar to your steve jobs example book. The pages with the class own-size are used to make the pages smaller so those covers(spine) is visible.

The problem I am having is that the two fixed pages show up in the wrong spot when the book is closed. The first one shows up to the left of the book before the book is opened, and the last one shows up to the right when you close the end of the book.

So first off, I would just like to say that turnjs really is a great piece of work!

So, I am using turnjs for a webapp that will be available on the desktop and the ipad. For this reason, I hoping that it is possible to scale the book down via css3 transform.

I see that turnjs has zoom method, but I am not entirely sure how to use it. If this is meant for scaling, is there a way you could point me in the right direction?

Thanks,

I am working on a project for an iPad app. The app has a built-in swipe functionality to change between pages. One of the pages will be a webview window with a turn.js-magazine in it (as a multi-paged ad).

It appears that turn.js prevents the app's swipe function from kicking in on the last page (which would be what I'd want), so the reader can't leave the ad (since swiping would be the only possible way out).

Is there a way to disable the turn.js-""swipe block"" for both ends of the magazine?

I have the following issue: when the next page is not yet loaded, the turning effect has a strange glitch on the top. See for example: http://domainname/valleyofsorrow/main.html, where domainname is meltingpot.hu (so replace domainname with meltingpot.hu), I just don't want this url to come up in google. :)

Any ideas? :)

I have a question about turn.js Script. I just need an App for iPad like this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9D-nD5v83c

What do I need to do everything? Is it enough if I take this https://github.com/blasten/turn.js/tree/master/demos/magazine? Or do I have to change what?

I suppose it happens because start of pinch gesture works the same way like swipe - I mean one finger slide. There is condition to turn the page only when touchmove event is made by only one finger (e.originalEvent.touches.length == 1) but I guess before swipe (one finger) becomes pinch (two fingers touches the screen) browser sees first event swipe, next event pinch separately. Same way when somebody take fingers off the screen (it never happens in exactly the same time).

I make this intro because I found that all the three zoom scripts got disabled after the sixth page of the catalog. On my first attempts I replaced the zoom activation of jQZoom & Cloud Zoom when hovering with a click but the issue was still there after clicking the seventh page. I temporary solved this issue by enabling a live clicking on the jQuery code but after acquiring the Magic Zoom script their support found that the problem lied on the pagesInDOM number.

Increasing this number solved the zoom problem but introduced a new one. Normally my catalogs will have 12 pages, as you can see here: http://grosmercat.iritec.es/digitalizacion/visualizacionPDF.php?file_name=horeca_05_centro_04-_04-30-2012_22-16-44, but I don't wanna limit my system to work with 12 only but to work as an standard that dynamically auto-adjust its size. I use turnjs.com scripting to solve IE issue and to recreate the shadow & side-buttons features but modified it a bit to include another buttons trying to simulate what happens here: http://issuu.com/folleto_oferta_gm/docs/gm09_catalunyaislas?mode=window&pageNumber=1 here you have the modified code: http://grosmercat.iritec.es/digitalizacion/js/prueba.js (compare with yours using Notepad++ or Araxis Merge to easily see the changes)

For some reason after changing the pagesInDOM number to 40 to test, when the catalog has less that 12 and finish with an even page the shadow appears wrongly when the catalog moves to close: http://grosmercat.iritec.es/digitalizacion/visualizacionPDF.php?file_name=euroleafletes_05-02-2012_18-45-06#8 Is there any way to change this number dynamically to avoid this issue?

It's quite easy to use and works well on the handful of browsers and devices I tried it with.

While browsing the Reference, I noticed the ""end"" event has been removed from the latest version, although ""start"" remains. However, I find myself in need of that event. Is it possible to have it re-added?

My use case is as follows: I want an element to be displayed to the left of a magazine while it is ""closed"" (that is, only page 1 is showing), as if it were page 0. When page 1 is flipped, thus making the magazine display pages 2 and 3, I want page 2 to cover that element.

I attempted to implement this behaviour by defining the element and using absolute positioning to move it to the desired place, and then adjusting its z-index whenever it is supposed to stand above or below the magazine and its pages. I managed to get it to work for page flips with the ""turn"" and ""turned"" events, but I still need to take actions when the user starts and stops dragging the folded page even when the page isn't flipped -- hence the need for an ""end"" event to complement the ""start"" event.

Right now I resorted to version 0.11 (at commit 9a978a2526ca9429ca5db35509aa0ed91f42a7de) to implement the desired behaviour.

First of all, I wanted to thank you for this great jQuery plugin you made there ! It's just awesome and the API is of very high standard.

After discovering your plugin, I tried to play with the code a little bit and I finally got stuck at some point !

Here is what I'm trying to do :

I've got my book in the background, but contents are displayed only on the right page of the book. So I activated only the bottom right and top right corner to navigate through the book in forward mode only. Everything is working fine, I can navigate through all the pages until the last one.

I've tried to add one last trick to this : when the user reaches the last page of the book, I want that the 2 forward navigation corners to still be activate and to redirect the user to the very first page of the book.

I've tried a bunch of things (playing with the addPage & removePage of the API and so on), but nohting worked. I don't know if I'm doing it right, so that's why I decided to try my luck here.

I really hope that you'll be able to give me the answers I've been seeking for.

Thank you a lot again for this super tool !

While working on the project, I noticed that the pageturn effect blocks any hover-effects or clicks for buttons or links. This problem can be easily reproduced by simply putting a link or button right below a page in the flipbook. If you then hover over the corner of a page, the pageturn effect kicks in (by ""folding"" the corner of the page). When this happens, the ""invisible"" div (that is rotated 90 degrees) used for the effect covers up the link or button below the page, making it impossible to click on it in any browser other than Internet Explorer.

The fix for this is very simple: you just need to add ""pointer-events: none"" to the style of that ""invisible"" div. This will effectively allow clicks and hover-events to pass through the div that is responsible for the pageturn effect. This works in all modern browsers (Firefox 3.6+, Safari 4+ and Chrome) except for Opera.

It's a nice plugin. Though I would suggest you to change a status label when WebRTC is enabled (because a current one is slightly confusing). So my proposed change:

The thing is that the double negation ""not disabled"" might be overlooked by a user such as me. After locating the word ""disabled"" I assume that everything is OK.

Let's set up the environment to be sure that you fully understand what I'm saying.

1) I am using a VPN.  Firefox is routed through this VPN. Every normal ""what is my ip"" website shows the IP of the VPN only.

2) Using **your addon**, every website that checks for WebRTC IP leaks shows my ISP's public IP.  **This is the WebRTC leak that is supposed to be blocked**.

Despite what you claim or whatever Mozilla's site claims about this new option, it does not work as an WebRTC leak prevention.

**USE A VPN FOR YOURSELF TO VERIFY AND DON'T JUST RELY ON WHAT ""SHOULD"" HAPPEN ACCORDING TO SOMEONE ELSE**

You can have all the reviews and comments removed that you wish but it does not change the fact that your addon does not work, and people will obviously see that for themselves.

Here's the PROOF.

This shows, with absolute proof, that your addon does not work as it should. WebRTC leak is to block your real public ip from being exposed through a VPN.

Same tests, with your addon disabled, and WebRTC Control addon enabled.

Works as it should to prevent public IP exposure through a VPN.

Please stop trying to convince me, or yourself, that your addon is working as it should. As I said before, if you think this is correct then change your name to ""WebRTC Publically Identifiable IP Leaker"".  

I have shown you with 100% absolute proof that your addon does not work.  Blocking your LAN IP's from being exposed is not the important part of the WebRTC leak.

Since you are a fan of posting search terms in some way to validate anything, here's one for you.  Read the first few sites that come up.

https://duckduckgo.com/?q=webrtc+security+flaw

> > ""VPN users are facing a massive security flaw as websites can easily see their home IP-addresses >>through WebRTC.""

If you still want to claim that any of these test sites are outdated and that would somehow make any difference --- the fact that the public ISP IP is being exposed is the only issue at hand.  It doesn't matter how the leak is tested or against what version of webrtc implementation it is tested against.. exposing the public ip is a failure.  If Mozilla wants to claim 

for what it's worth, just playing with the settings real quick

media.peerconnection.enabled = false; no webrtc leak
or
media.peerconnection.ice.default_address_only = true; hides lan ip but exposes public ip
or
media.peerconnection.ice.relay_only = true; hides all ips, no webrtc leak
but may still have exposure against a new detection method that these sites do not test for. according to mozilla's page

> > NOTE: does not hide your external IP address from the TURN server itself (see >> use_document_iceservers and default_iceservers to restrict to a TURN of your choice). 

Ultimately, the only way to be sure there is no IP leak is to disable WebRTC completely.

I think implementing this here would be a nice idea too, so you only have to answer a question if you want to use WebRTC and otherwise you have no privacy impact.
