There's also a more practical example of this in a single workflow here: https://github.com/alexwilson/frontend/blob/master/.github/workflows/auto-approve.yml

Both, so far,¬†are working as before - and while the communication from GitHub wasn't ideal it was a useful exercise because it encouraged me to think about 3rd party code having access to secrets.  @JakeChampion made an excellent recommendation to lock 3rd party actions to a specific commit hash since they are (in-theory) immutable which reduces risk even further.",NA,https://api.github.com/repos/hmarr/auto-approve-action/issues/183/comments,https://github.com/hmarr/auto-approve-action/issues/183#issuecomment-799367347,https://api.github.com/repos/hmarr/auto-approve-action/issues/183

If it's a bot `dependabot` - both `pull_request` and the new `pull_request_target` with the default `created` & `edited` events **will _not_ allow read-access to secrets**.

The `labeled` event for `pull_request_target`, however, _does_ allow this as it is restricted to those with label access - and only special cases (i.e. `dependabot` or other explicitly installed apps) are still able to label PRs despite not having full access to the repository.  So it is ""safer"".

And it triggers a workflow, with read-access to secrets, and in read/write scope (e.g. the `GITHUB_TOKEN` allows one to issue an automatic approval - [you can see an example of this here](https://github.com/alexwilson/enable-github-automerge-action/pull/24)).  

Another change I made here - is checking for the creator of the pull-request, not the actor associated with an event, so that the action can be re-triggered & debugged manually.  If / when this action fails again, I'll be able to re-trigger the workflow and since the original creator was `dependabot` - it works as normal.

I tried to answer this above - you are fine with an open contributing policy - the primary restriction is you should probably be using `pull_request_target` for any workflows that need to write back to your repo _because_ pull-request-target operates in the base branch (i.e. 3rd party code cannot accidentally run!).

If you need to _also_ do something with the code itself (i.e. run tests) - `pull_request` actions run _without any secrets_ in the branch being PR'd and you can run these in parallel.  For more complicated edge-cases (i.e. you want to provide a BrowserStack token to do some E2E testing) GitHub's recommendation is you invoke these workflows manually _after_ auditing the code.

In the context of my action & this one - I don't think that enabling either of these for 3rd parties is wise - you probably shouldn't be approving unaudited code - BUT if you would like to, `pull_request_target` triggered by humans will work.

The docs are awfully confusing - this is intel pieced together from a Github Support thread, many pages of docs, and the two blog posts GitHub have on this.  I'm feeding back in the support thread, so hopefully this will be clarified.

**I think switching from `pull_request` to `pull_request_target` should work.** I'm pretty sure that the read-only tokens introduced last month should only apply to Dependabot pull requests triggered by `pull_request` events. Switching to `pull_request_target` will run the workflow in the target branch (e.g. `main` rather than the PR's branch), but that's not a problem for this action as it just leaves a review and doesn't look at the code in the pull request.

I tried both, and confirmed that `pull_request_target` does work as expected:

#### `pull_request`
[This actions run](https://github.com/hmarr/auto-approve-test/runs/2116761899?check_suite_focus=true) was triggered using the `pull_request` event, and it failed because the token only had `read` access to pull requests.

**If you're seeing ""Resource not accessible by integration"" with a workflow file (in a public repo) that _already_ has been switched over to `pull_request_target`, can you point me to the actions run?** I don't think that should be happening, so if it is I'd like to investigate.

_Aside: I don't think the linked [Security Lab blog post](https://securitylab.github.com/research/github-actions-preventing-pwn-requests) is relevant. It raises a security issue associated with checking out potentially vulnerable code in the course of an Actions workflow, which this action doesn't do._

1. Add *the user that owns the `GITHUB_TOKEN` your are using for the workflow* to your `CODEOWNERS` file like so:

    ```config
    package.json @token-user
    yarn.lock @token-user
    ```
2. Ensure that only pull requests marked for automatic merge get approvals:

   ```yaml
   - uses: hmarr/auto-approve-action@v2.0.0
     if:
       (github.actor == 'dependabot[bot]' || github.actor == 'dependabot-preview[bot]')
       && contains(github.event.pull_request.body, 'will automatically merge')
   ```

---

‚ö†Ô∏è Important: make sure you add the `contains(github.event.pull_request.body, 'will automatically merge')` condition, otherwise @dependabot-preview will merge all pull requests that it opens because they all receive an approval from a code owner without that condition.

I think this might be better off as a separate action (such as [this one](https://github.com/pascalgn/automerge-action)). As actions can be composed in a workflow file, I think it's probably better to keep individual actions relatively small and simple. 

Using the example I linked above, the relevant section of the workflow file should end up looking something like this:

```yaml
    - uses: hmarr/auto-approve-action@v2.0.0
      if: github.actor == 'dependabot[bot]' || github.actor == 'dependabot-preview[bot]'
      with:
        github-token: ""${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}""
    - uses: pascalgn/automerge-action@v0.4.0
      if: github.actor == 'dependabot[bot]' || github.actor == 'dependabot-preview[bot]'
      with:
        github-token: ""${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}""
```

I basically followed the [official GitHub Actions tutorial](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/continuous-integration/github-actions/) but tried to use version 2.0.4 instead of 2.0.1. It works up to 2.0.3, so it looks like it's an error on the `Gemfile` search logic.

I can totally generate a `Gemfile.lock` file as I'm working on Linux.

- For `<user>.github.io` repos a user of that action **needs** to work on a branch different to `master`

Not working on `master` is strange for me, even it's just a definition. So would also like to see an option to configure the target-branch or somehow disable that logic for `<user>.github.io`-repos.

The TL;DR: Ruby 2.6 is probably more compatible with more Jekyll plugins (and more `Gemfile.lock` bundles) than the 2.7 version this action uses currently.

But your question is a good one! And I‚Äôm not sure of the best answer.

- This PR simply uses a Ruby 2.6 image, which is a good guess for the moment (more widely compatible with Jekyll plugins than 2.7 right now), but may not work for everybody.
- Systems seem to ship with the Bundler version that was current for the particular version of Ruby. So Alpine with Ruby 2.6 ships with Bundler 1.17, and 2.7 with Bundler 2.1.
- Folks who use modern best practices like `rbenv` can install multiple Ruby versions with the proper version of Bundler for each. But this is perhaps not common knowledge among those starting out with Jekyll.

The problem is this: when you do a `bundle install` the version of Bundler gets written into `Gemfile.lock` ‚Äî which means that if you committed a lock file written by one version of Bundler, the install using a different Bundler version will conk at the install step.

I don‚Äôt know how commonplace it is to have mismatched Ruby and Bundler versions, but Bundler 2.1 will install on older Rubys like 2.6, so it‚Äôs possible.

@michaelcurran is working around this by parsing `Gemfile.lock` directly: https://github.com/helaili/jekyll-action/issues/16#issuecomment-639323754

Longer term though, would it be better to let folks choose their Ruby version by reading `.rbenv` file or some other means? Maybe. But that‚Äôs harder to do with a Docker-based action ‚Äî especially since the Actions runners already provide a quick install route for different Ruby versions.

A different way to address this is to use the Rubys that are already available on the Actions runner, using the `ruby/setup-ruby` action in a workflow like this.

	- name: üíé setup ruby
	  uses: ruby/setup-ruby@v1
	  with:
	    ruby-version: 2.6
	
	- name: Jekyll build
	  run: |
	    bundle install
	    bundle exec jekyll build

With this approach, folks who need Ruby 2.7 can just specify it ‚Äî and they get the proper version of Bundler automagically. And the version is saved in the workflow, version controlled along with `Gemfile.lock`. 

You can see the entire workflow, which includes caching and publishing here: [https://github.com/universal-exports-ltd/slide-heroes/blob/master/.github/workflows/jekyll-build.yml](https://github.com/universal-exports-ltd/slide-heroes/blob/master/.github/workflows/jekyll-build.yml).

But this is a completely different architecture than the Docker action you have here.

I could be wrong, but I don't believe there's anything special with the Custom Domain setting in the Repository Settings. As far as I know, setting that field will create a file called `CNAME` on the selected branch, with the contents being the custom domain you entered. If you select the deployment branch, the file will be added, but this action will overwrite it on next deploy.

1. Use `gem_src` when provided, 
1. If not, look into `jekyll_src`, 
1. If still not found, lookup for `Gemfile.lock`. 

My thinking is it would allow to locate the whole site including the `Gemfile` into a single directory without having to specify both parameters.

I don't think the git push is password based. Instead of committing as a certain user, the commits are coming from ""GitHub actions"".

I'm keeping everything related to static site in it's own directory, so `jekyll_src` is of no help for me (see https://github.com/inkremental/inkremental/tree/master/docs for the reference).

Both my and @abhishekmit1982 take is to add an option to change the directory entirely before running other commands. The downside is the fact that `vendor/bundle` cache is also moved, one should change it's location to some well-known location.

@limjh16 proposed another interesting option of passing additional `--gemfile` parameter to `bundle`. I've just tried this, it seems to be working as expected with some changes to parameters:
```
bundle update --gemfile docs/Gemfile 
bundle exec --gemfile docs/Gemfile jekyll serve -s docs -d docs/_site
```
I'm not seeing any downsides to it, there are no files in the root directory after running this. So I'm actually leaning to it. Unfortunately `jekyll_src` doesn't tweak Jekyll output directory, and making it so would be a breaking change. Also Gemfile location tweaking could be either relative to working directory or `jekyll_src` value.

I added that bundle line in my Gemfile as an experiment solution but it meant the error was the same as without it. The reason yours works is your lock file  bundler matches your container's bundle version. I could upgrade mine but then my other projects need to match my new system version. And then I'm always tied to the version of this action. (Or I edit or drop my lock file.)

That's why I suggested a workflow param so then the build steps use an given bundler version. e.g. 1.17.2

Yes as that article says, Netlify is smart enough to work any Bundler version in a lock file, not just the latest. It might do a selective install of Bundler - I got an error trying to install two versions of Bundler.

I set a custom `BUNDLER_VERSION` variable in my workflow file's `env`. And that gets used in `Dockerfile`. And if the value is not set, then `Dockerfile` falls back to hardcoded value of `2.1.4`.

https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/jekyll-action/pull/1

I tested my solution by setting `1.17.3` in my sample `test.yaml` workflow file and changing the lockfile use to `1.17.3`. There are no errors like in my original comment at the top of this issue and the site builds.

Notes

- Perhaps there's a better way to set/validate if this using `inputs` rather than `env`, like for`jekyll_src`. On that, is `jekyll_src` actually used and test? It gets set as an input with `inputs.jekyll_src` but then `INPUT_JEKYLL_SRC` is used in entry point script and I can't see how that is set.
- For background, I got idea from this [PR](https://github.com/spinnaker/spinnaker.github.io/pull/1573/files) based on few projects linked [here](https://github.com/docker-library/ruby/issues/246) and it does an explicit install of bundler.

```
<ul>
<% 100.times do %>
  <li><%= inline_svg_tag ""handle.svg"" %> Item</li>
<% end %>
</ul>
```

Here the content of the `handle.svg` is inlined for every list item.  If it's a complex SVG this could result in significantly larger HTML.

It's possible to reference part of another SVG using an id like this:

```
<svg style=""display: none"">
  <symbol id=""handle-icon"">...</symbol>
</svg>
<ul>
<% 100.times do %>

This is similar to the first attempt taken by GitHub mentioned in [this blog post](https://github.blog/2016-02-22-delivering-octicons-with-svg/#our-approach). Looks like they had cross-domain issue preventing them from doing this, but many don't have that issue.

Based on your second example, which is no doubt simplified for clarity, how do you imagine the `inline_svg` API  would work? The simplest thing I can of is to pass the collection to `inline_svg`, which would render the SVG document first, setting the `display:none` style (presumably), and then yield each item of the collection to the block, like this:

```ruby
<ul>
  <%= (inline_svg_tag ""handle.svg"", with_use_tag: 100.times) do |item| %>
    <li><svg><use href=""#handle-icon"" /></svg> <%= item %></li>
  <% end %>
</ul>
```

This assumes the caller would assemble their own slim SVGs in the block, with the relevant `<use>` tag. I'm not sure if this actually buys you much though. I feel like I'm still missing something here. ü§î

@jamesmartin good question. In my example I included the svg on the same page but I think it would be better done through a separate URL which could join multiple svgs together, perhaps join everything within a directory similar to how a sprite library works.

```
# app/assets/images/icons/handle.svg
# app/assets/images/icons/login.svg
# app/assets/images/icons/profile.svg
# app/assets/images/icons/settings.svg
```

Behind the scenes this would generate an `app/assets/images/icons.svg` file (maybe through a configuration) which would combine all of the files in the directory under one svg and auto-generate a unique id for each one based on the filename.

```
<svg xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"">
  <symbol id=""handle"" viewBox=""0 0 14 14"">...</symbol>
  <symbol id=""login"" viewBox=""0 0 14 14"">...</symbol>
  <symbol id=""profile"" viewBox=""0 0 14 14"">...</symbol>
  <symbol id=""settings"" viewBox=""0 0 14 14"">...</symbol>
</svg>
```

Then you could do `<%= inline_svg_use_tag ""icons/handle.svg"" %>` which could output something like this:

```
<svg xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"" width=""14"" height=""14""><use href=""assets/icons.svg#handle"" /></svg>
```

The `icons.svg` file could be cached by the browser similar to images so we have all icons under one request and the generated HTML is very slim.

I understand if this is outside the scope of `inline_svg` since it involves some asset pipeline magic. Would be cool to have though.

`inline_svg` does have at least a superficial dependency on the asset pipeline (to find assets) and I'm not against this as a feature. Unfortunately I don't think I'm going to have the bandwidth to work on something like this any time soon. If you, or anybody else, wants to spike this out I'd be happy to help design the API and get PRs merged etc.",NA,https://api.github.com/repos/jamesmartin/inline_svg/issues/124/comments,https://github.com/jamesmartin/inline_svg/issues/124#issuecomment-759704218,https://api.github.com/repos/jamesmartin/inline_svg/issues/124

Here's what I'm thinking.

1. Add per request caching to getting svg files (good optimization to add, regardless of `use` tag.)

```diff
module Helpers
  def inline_svg_tag(filename, transform_params={})
    with_asset_finder(InlineSvg.configuration.asset_finder) do
-     render_inline_svg(filename, transform_params)
+     cache_inline_svg(filename, transform_params)
    end
  end

+ def cache_inline_svg(*args)
+   @svg_files ||= {}
+   @svg_files[args] ||= render_inline_svg(*args)
+ end
...
```

2. Look for `use` flag or `use_id` flag.  SVG use requires a unique id per svg sprite, so it would be a great developer experience to auto-create a unique id if they did not specify one.  However, use their id if they did specify one.

3. `inline_svg_tag` with `use` param returns:

   ```html
   <svg xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"">
     <use href=""#inline-svg-aircraft-a4zde5d"" x=""20"" fill=""white"" stroke=""red""/>
   <svg>
   ```

4. Finally, a helper method which combines the unique `@svg_files` into a single svg sprite. 

   ```erb
   <%= inline_svg_sprites_tag, style: 'display: none;' %>
   ```

    or

   ```erb
   <% content_for :svg_sprites do %>
       <%= inline_svg_sprites_tag %>
   <% end %>
   ```


   which renders something like

   ```html
   <svg style=""display:none;"">
     <symbol id=""inline-svg-aircraft-a4zde5d"" viewBox=""0 0 62 51"">
       <path fill=""#000000"" d=""M38.9872...""></path>
     </symbol>
     <symbol id=""inline-svg-attachment-de5da4z"" viewBox=""0 0 60 64"">
       <path fill=""#000000"" d=""M15.9264...""></path>
     </symbol>
     <symbol id=""inline-svg-brush-hasd98w"" viewBox=""0 0 62 62"">
       <path fill=""#000000"" d=""M7.8416...""></path>
     </symbol>
     <symbol id=""inline-svg-camer-8hx9rf"" viewBox=""0 0 64 52"">
       <path fill=""#000000"" d=""M32,19.2 ...""</path>
     </symbol>
   </svg> 
   ```

This would certainly speed up pages with lots of SVG files.

I started playing with this idea in a separate repo that I maintain to manually test the gem on different versions of Rails. You can see that the [integration tests](https://github.com/jamesmartin/inline_svg_test_app/blob/44263a8942f9d7cbfc29a81cacd8e4c26009c279/test/integration/smoke_test.rb) I was able to write are fairly comprehensive and I was able to get the tests running on [rails3](https://github.com/jamesmartin/inline_svg_test_app/runs/444830070), [rails4](https://github.com/jamesmartin/inline_svg_test_app/runs/444829060), [rails5](https://github.com/jamesmartin/inline_svg_test_app/runs/444778996) and [rails6](https://github.com/jamesmartin/inline_svg_test_app/runs/444812752) with Sprockets. The tests for the [rails6-webpacker](https://github.com/jamesmartin/inline_svg_test_app/runs/444821261) branch are currently broken because of a configuration problem but I think they should be fixable.

I'm wondering if we could use the integration tests for my test app as the integration tests for this gem somehow. I'll think more about how that might work. ü§î

Hmmm ... after looking at the code more, I'm not sure it's possible to remain totally backwards-compatible. ü§î In order to pass the `asset_finder` all the wait down the chain, the method signature for asset file classes would need to change from `named(asset_name)` to `named(asset_name, asset_finder)`.

This is fine for built-in asset files ([`InlineSvg::AssetFile.named`](https://github.com/jamesmartin/inline_svg/blob/master/lib/inline_svg/asset_file.rb#L6-L11) and [`InlineSvg::CachedAssetFile#named`](https://github.com/jamesmartin/inline_svg/blob/master/lib/inline_svg/cached_asset_file.rb#L28-L31)), but _does_ present a problem for [custom asset file loaders](https://github.com/jamesmartin/inline_svg#custom-asset-file-loader).

I'm wondering if we could:

1. Release a patch version using the aforementioned `Thread.current` fix. It's a bit ugly, but it works ‚Äî and is arguably less ugly than sporadically disappearing SVGs üòï 
2. Consider a new API for asset files/loaders in [Version 2.0](https://github.com/jamesmartin/inline_svg/issues/1050) that eliminates the need for the `Thread.current` fix. Perhaps the internal and external APIs can be simplified, now that webpack is officially supported by Rails and this library supports both Sprockets and Webpacker simultaneously.

When using this in production I always use paths containing non-fingerprinted, ""static"", assets.

Thanks for finding a workaround. Seems like there's a couple of options for how to fix this, but it's probably going to involve two lookups: first using the ""static"" name of the asset and falling back to the ""fingerprinted"" name (via `Webpacker.manifest.lookup` or whatever).

I think that may be a key problem for our case.

Our app uses *both* the asset pipeline and Webpack (via Webpacker) as we slowly migrate from the former to the latter. The two tools process completely independent sets of assets for us.

As I understand the problem, `app.instance_variable_get(:@assets)` returns `nil` in production because the assets have been precompiled. However, because we have Webpack, the `WebpackAssetFinder` is enabled. However, Webpack doesn't know about these assets, so when the SVG is requested the finder fails.

Prior to 1.5, the fallback would have gone to the static asset finder, which would find the precompiled assets .",NA,https://api.github.com/repos/jamesmartin/inline_svg/issues/98/comments,https://github.com/jamesmartin/inline_svg/issues/98#issuecomment-503681579,https://api.github.com/repos/jamesmartin/inline_svg/issues/98

> If you have both Sprockets and Webpacker enabled for some reason and you want Inline SVG to use Webpacker to find SVGs then you should configure the asset_finder appropriately

I'm going to add a note about using the `StaticAssetFinder` if you precompile assets in production.

In your case I think it's sufficient to just configure the `StaticAssetFinder` explicitly until you decide whether Webpacker will be bundling your image assets:

```ruby
InlineSvg.configure do |config|
  config.asset_finder = InlineSvg::StaticAssetFinder
end
```

Given this is a breaking change, I probably should have bumped the major version to 2.0. Apologies again for the disruption. ü§î 

> Ideal is to have both finders work together. Of course check if webpack if available, if not only static finder works

That's kind of a complicated problem because Webpacker doesn't expose any reliable method to ask, ""is Webpacker bundling images"". We *could* check the Webpacker manifest file and start greping for paths that appear to be images, but that's probably not very reliable.

I am using Rails 6.0rc1 - Ruby 2.5.3 and inline_svg v1.5.2 and I am only using webpacker (no sprockets).

When I use the `InlineSvg::WebpackAssetFinder` config, that finder only appears to find files that are precompiled (that is, I run `$./bin/webpack` before I start my server. If I do that, the finder find's my files no problem. However, it does not appear to use any assets found via `webpack-dev-server` or update changes based on if I remove or add files to my images folder.

This is the finder that I was using before (1.3) the 1.5.2 update:

```ruby
class WebpackerAssetFinder
  class FoundAsset
    require 'open-uri'
    attr_reader :path

    def initialize(path)
      @path = path
    end

    def pathname
      if Webpacker.dev_server.running?
        begin
          asset = open(webpacker_dev_server_url)
          tempfile = Tempfile.new(path)
          tempfile.binmode
          tempfile.write(asset.read)
          tempfile.rewind
          tempfile
        rescue StandardError => e
          Rails.logger.error ""Error creating tempfile: #{e}""
          raise
        end
      else
        Rails.application.root.join(""public"", path.gsub(/\A\//, """"))
      end
    end

    private

    def webpacker_dev_server_url
      ""#{Webpacker.dev_server.protocol}://#{Webpacker.dev_server.host_with_port}#{path}""
    end
  end

  def find_asset(filename)
    if webpack_asset_path = Webpacker.manifest.lookup(filename)
      FoundAsset.new(webpack_asset_path)
    end
  end
end

# Override the Sprockets asset finder. This is my old homebrew method.
InlineSvg.configure do |config|
  config.asset_finder = WebpackerAssetFinder.new
end
```

and it still works fine with the 1.5.2 version plugin.

Here's how I've approached the issue. The following solution works with Webpacker, whether the dev server is running or the assets have been compiled to my public/ directory.

InlineSvg allows for creation of custom asset finders so that's what this does.

I'm fairly certain there may be a cleaner way to do this, but this works.

It seems the problem is related to the fact that Webpacker assets are served from a separate server in development mode. I guess another solution would be to only use your custom asset finder in Rails' development mode.

I'm going to close this out for now.

To get around it I had to make some changes to the solution @moxie posted above.

First, ensure you don't use `asset_pack_path` in your `inline_svg` call, otherwise the asset will not be found in the webpack manifest.

The next issue I had (likely because I have some nested paths), is that the creation of the `Tempfile` failed (and was caught by the gem, so the issue was hard to track down). I opted to leave off the `path` and just let it generate a unique filename for me.

Lastly, since I depend on both webpacker _and_ the asset pipeline, I ended up with a fallback approach.

Here's what I ended up with:

```ruby
class WebpackerAssetFinder
  class FoundAsset
    attr_reader :path

    def initialize(path)
      @path = path
    end

    def pathname
      if Webpacker.dev_server.running?
        asset = open(webpacker_dev_server_url)

        begin
          tempfile = Tempfile.new(path)
          tempfile.binmode
          tempfile.write(asset.read)
          tempfile.rewind
          tempfile
        rescue StandardError => e
          Rails.logger.error ""Error creating tempfile: #{e}""
          raise
        end
      else
        Rails.application.root.join(""public"", path.gsub(/\A\//, """"))
      end
    end

    private

    def webpacker_dev_server_url
      ""#{Webpacker.dev_server.protocol}://#{Webpacker.dev_server.host_with_port}#{path}""
    end
  end

  def find_asset(filename)
    if webpack_asset_path = Webpacker.manifest.lookup(filename)
      FoundAsset.new(webpack_asset_path)
    end
  end
end
```

Then in the `config/initializers/inline_svg.rb` initializer:

```ruby
class FallbackAssetFinder
  attr_reader :finders

  def initialize(finders)
    @finders = finders
  end

  def find_asset(filename)
    # try each finder, in order, return the first path found
    finders.lazy.map { |f| f.find_asset(filename) }.find { |x| x != nil }
  end
end

# Some of our SVG assets will be in the asset pipeline, some from webpacker,
# This allows us to find the SVGs for inlining in both cases.
InlineSvg.configuration.asset_finder = FallbackAssetFinder.new([
  WebpackerAssetFinder.new,
  InlineSvg::StaticAssetFinder,
])
```

The general idea of the previous exmples works, but I had to adapt it in two ways:



1. **Finding the asset**
   to support identifying the asset with or without the `media/images` path segments, I had to modify the lookup. You could do this in various more straightforward ways... but given I had the `hashie` dependency already, I went with the following quick update to maintain consistency with the [path formats accepted by the `asset_path_tag` helper](https://github.com/rails/webpacker/blob/master/docs/assets.md)

   ```ruby
   require 'hashie'
   
   def find_asset(filename)
     assets = Hashie::Rash.new(Webpacker.manifest.instance_variable_get('@data'))
     webpack_asset_path = assets[%r{(media\/images\/)?#{filename}}]
   
     return unless webpack_asset_path.present?
   
     WebpackerAssetFinder::FoundAsset.new(webpack_asset_path)
   end
   ```

   

2. **Reading the svg data**
   I was seeing this error when attempting acceses the resource on the dev server via `open` as in the above examples despite it being the correct location (I can visit it directly and see the content).

   ```
   Errno::ENOENT: No such file or directory @ rb_sysopen http://localhost:3035/packs/media/i.....
   ```

   

   So, I make a request and get the data from the reponse... 

   ```ruby
   def pathname
     # The dev server is running. Load the SVG into a Tempfile.
     if Webpacker.dev_server.running?
       http = Net::HTTP.new(Webpacker.config.dev_server[:host], Webpacker.config.dev_server[:port])
       resp = http.get(path)
   
       return unless resp.code == '200'
   
       tempfile = Tempfile.new(path)
       tempfile.binmode
       tempfile.write(resp.body)
       tempfile.rewind
   
       tempfile
     # The dev server isn't running. The asset will be compiled to public.
     else
       Rails.application.root.join 'public', path.gsub(%r{\A\/}, '')
     end
   end
   ```

   convoluted, yes...works, yes.

One of the reasons for allowing [custom transformations](https://github.com/jamesmartin/inline_svg/tree/8e9c3afff89838cc42f35ff97979d9747581e50e#custom-transformations) of SVGs is to keep the core code simple and easy to maintain, while allowing individual users to depend on third-party SVG optimizers if they choose.

Another strategy, involving even less runtime complexity, would be to optimize SVGs separately from this library, perhaps as part of the asset pipeline or other build/deploy step, which could then be [cached at boot time](https://github.com/jamesmartin/inline_svg/tree/8e9c3afff89838cc42f35ff97979d9747581e50e#caching-all-assets-at-boot-time).

I'd be happy to help you get either or both of these strategies working but I'm not convinced that adding extra SVG optimization to the core of this library is a worthwhile feature.

Agreed. My chief concern with the change that I was experimenting with is that it would alter the behavior of the method slightly. In my very brief test I tried adding a short circuit into the `TransformPipeline.generate_html_from` method to avoid parsing the input with Nokogiri if there are no transformations:
```ruby
def self.generate_html_from(svg_file, transform_params)
  return svg_file.to_s unless transform_params.any? || Transformations.custom_transformations.any?
  ...
```

However, it alters the returned SVG markup slightly because it's no longer cleaned up by Nokogiri, as demonstrated by this failing spec:
```
InlineSvg::ActionView::Helpers#inline_svg when passed IO object argument return valid svg for file
     Failure/Error: expect(output).to eq ""<svg xmlns=\""http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"" xml:lang=\""en\"" role=\""presentation\""><!-- This is a test comment --></svg>\n""

       expected: ""<svg xmlns=\""http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"" xml:lang=\""en\"" role=\""presentation\""><!-- This is a test comment --></svg>\n""
            got: ""<svg xmlns=\""http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\""\n     xml:lang=\""en\""\n     role=\""presentation\""><!-- This is a test comment --></svg>\n""
```

This represents a change in behavior that some users of the gem may not be expecting. Also, the markup returned when you pass transformation options may be slightly different than when you do not pass options. It's a minor inconsistency, and I don't think it's a _huge_ issue, but I figured it was worth discussing before throwing it into a PR. üòÑ",NA,https://api.github.com/repos/jamesmartin/inline_svg/issues/84/comments,https://github.com/jamesmartin/inline_svg/pull/84#issuecomment-384504641,https://api.github.com/repos/jamesmartin/inline_svg/issues/84

> I‚Äôm loading our SVG icon set outside of the assets folder, to avoid the asset pipeline and costly asset compilation. But inline_svg doesn‚Äôt recognize absolute file paths, since it relies on sprockets‚Äô .find_asset method.

Have you considered using the [boot-time asset caching](https://github.com/jamesmartin/inline_svg#caching-all-assets-at-boot-time) configuration? This accepts any absolute paths you choose and pre-loads all SVG documents during the Rails boot process. The configuration would look something like this:

```ruby
InlineSvg.configure do |config|
  config.asset_file = InlineSvg::CachedAssetFile.new(
    paths: [
      ""/absolute/path/to"",
      ""/some/other/absolute/path/of/your/choosing""
    ],
    filters: /\.svg/
  )
end
```

Then you could either call `inline_svg` and pass the absolute path, or you could pass just a fragment:

```erb
<%= inline_svg ""/absolute/path/to/file.svg"" %>
<%= inline_svg ""/absolute/path/to/file"" %>
<%= inline_svg ""file.svg"" %>
<%= inline_svg ""of/your/choosing/other-file"" %>
```

> Can you add support for absolute file paths? I‚Äôm assuming it would require a few lines added to either AssetFile or FindsAssetPaths

I'll definitely keep this in mind for a future update.

Using this new feature, one might do something like this:

```ruby
class InMemorySVG
  SVGS = {
    marker: ""<svg>something</svg>"",
    other: ""<svg>other</svg>""
  }

InlineSvg.configure do |config|
  config.asset_file(InMemorySVG)
end

# view
= inline_svg(:marker, class: ""blue"")
```

Is that the basic idea?

---

As an aside, here's an example of how to memoize inline SVGs to speedup rendering without using a custom loader. I wanted to render SVG map markers with different colors using CSS. Calling `inline_svg` repeatedly in a view was expensive, so I wrapped the method (in a presenter or helper):

```ruby
def svg_marker
  @svg_marker ||= inline_svg(""marker.svg"", class: ""blue"")
end
```

The benefit of the above code is that it loads the SVG from the file only once per request, which was fast enough for my case.",NA,https://api.github.com/repos/jamesmartin/inline_svg/issues/61/comments,https://github.com/jamesmartin/inline_svg/pull/61#issuecomment-294207064,https://api.github.com/repos/jamesmartin/inline_svg/issues/61

@teeparham yes, that's the basic idea. Taking your example one step further I've been experimenting with having the custom asset file take a list of static asset directories (and filter patterns) that it uses to glob for SVGs, which are then pre-loaded into memory on application startup. That way *all* assets are cached and avoid filesystem reads. I may make this an optional part of the gem if it turns out to be useful.

> Calling inline_svg repeatedly in a view was expensive, so I wrapped the method (in a presenter or helper)

That's a nice example of memoizing the call to `inline_svg`. I've been profiling the code recently and plan to make some performance improvements soon such that even hundreds of thousands of calls per page should be super fast (not the case currently).",NA,https://api.github.com/repos/jamesmartin/inline_svg/issues/61/comments,https://github.com/jamesmartin/inline_svg/pull/61#issuecomment-294724318,https://api.github.com/repos/jamesmartin/inline_svg/issues/61

@Geetakokate thanks for the feedback. Until this bug is fixed, you can workaround the problem by only using SVG documents that contain a `<svg>` element at the root. E.g.

Bad :-1: :

Good üëç :

I want to think very carefully before adding new built-in transformations. I'm trying hard to prevent the core of this gem becoming complicated and difficult to maintain. If it's easy to maintain then I can keep it updated and compatible with a wide range of Rails projects. 

That said, I have a few questions about the functionality of this transformation:

- How do we know which attributes are unwanted? Would this be configurable by the user?
- How many built-in unwanted style attributes would we have to consider?
- Would it be possible for the user to configure the transformation to remove additional attributes?

One way to help me make a decision is to create a [Custom Transformation](https://github.com/jamesmartin/inline_svg#custom-transformations), demonstrating the intended behavior. If your custom transformation seems like it would be useful to many users then it would be an easier decision to accept it into the core.

If you were trying to style every SVG couldn't you just style that base class accordingly?

At work we use a bastard mutation of SMACSS and ITCSS. The older I get, the more I realize the need for the styling of a reasonable number of base classes. Things like `table` for consistent tabular layouts, or `h1` through `h6` because I don't want to have to write `heading heading--1` on every single `h1` element, just to achieve a style that could easily be done in a base layer.

This is where my curiosity comes in... if you're interested in styling _every_ SVG in some consistent way, what's the difference between:

```css
svg { width: 100px; height: 100px; }
```
and
```css
.svg { width: 100px; height: 100px; }

You've now clobbered it by styling the base element. It does make sense to style base elements sometimes, but not with something as specific as dimensions. Some flexible defaults might make sense (for example `width:100%; height:auto;` for responsive images. If you look at ITCSS it does the bare minimum with the base classes. Just sets flexible, sensible defaults on top of normalisation. 

Actually, even your h1 example is something I avoid. h1-6 have semantic meaning (the importance of the header) but this should be decoupled from the styling as otherwise you bake in the way the header looks with what it means. This might make sense in simple documents, but often not in a complex webpage or application and not on a responsive site where often on mobile, sizes are not indicative of importance. 

It is also much easier to remove styles by removing a class than by overriding base styles - How can you remove a style on a base element?

The Sprockets asset finder is pretty lenient, allowing you to leave off the file extension.

We could update the naive asset finder to append `.svg` if it's not present. The reason we don't raise an error when a file is not found is to mirror Rails' built-in image tag helpers, which will simply render the `<img ... />` tag regardless if the file exists.

@madeindjs the reason I chose to add the empty `<svg>` tag is to match the behavior of Rails' built in helpers like `image_tag`, which don't care if the file specified exists, it just renders the `<img>` tag. I felt this would be more consistent and approachable to Rails developers. We added the extension ""hint"" as a convenience.

I'm reluctant to build more specific transformations into the library because it increases the maintenance overhead: For example, when illustrator changes the way it creates its XML markup output, `inline_svg` would have to follow suit and support both old and new versions.

@andrewaguiar No, sorry. It's not possible, but I'm open to changing the gem to accommodate ""static"" custom transformations.

As a workaround I suggest rewriting your transformation like this:

  def transform(doc)
    svg = doc.at_css('svg')
    svg['focusable'] = !!value.to_s
    doc
  end
end
```

Configure it like this:

``` ruby
InlineSvg.configure do |config|
  config.add_custom_transformation(attribute: :focusable, transform: SetFocusableToFalseTransform)
end
```

And use it like this:

``` ruby
inline_svg('some-document.svg', focusable: true)
inline_svg('some-document.svg', focusable: false)
```

> It looks like I have to make .svg files of all the elements seperatly.

Correct. If you want to inline each icon separately then it's easiest to make them separate files. 

`inline_svg` can't embed individual regions but you could write a [custom transformation](https://github.com/jamesmartin/inline_svg#custom-transformations) to do it.

> but still no output.

When I try to embed your SVG, I also see nothing in the browser. But, the SVG does get embedded in the HTML, so `inline_svg` is working as expected.

I managed to get your icons working by splitting them up into individual files like this (this is the search icon):

``` xml
<svg xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"">
  <path d=""M12.8 11.4c.9-1.2 1.4-2.7 1.4-4.3C14.2 3.2 11 0 7.1 0S0 3.2 0 7.1c0 3.9 3.2 7.1 7.1 7.1 1.6 0 3.1-.5 4.3-1.4l5.2 5.2 1.4-1.4-5.2-5.2zM2 7.1C2 4.3 4.3 2 7.1 2s5.1 2.3 5.1 5.1-2.3 5.1-5.1 5.1S2 9.9 2 7.1z""/>
</svg>
```

**_NOTE:**_ I removed the `fill=""currentColor""` attribute from the `<path>` element, so that I can set the color with CSS (see below).

Then I embedded them in my template, like this:

``` ruby
inline_svg(""icon_search_symbol.svg"", class=""my-class"")
```

Finally, I styled them with CSS:

``` sass
.svg {
  .my-class {
    width: 7em;
    height: 7em;
    fill: red;
  }
}
```

And here's how it looks in the browser:

Do you want to allow both filenames _and_ IO objects?

``` ruby

#./lib/noop_asset_finder.rb
class NoopAssetFinder

  # custom asset finder that simply returns IO objects, rather than attempting to look up their path
  def self.find_asset(filename)
    if filename.is_a?(IO)
      filename
    end
  end
end

#./config/initializers/inline_svg.rb
InlineSvg.configure do |config|
  config.asset_finder = NoopAssetFinder
end

I'm not super familiar with how gulp and rails play together, but I'd start by checking the path that the `gulp_asset_path` helper is returning when you pass it your SVG as an argument:

`%h1=gulp_asset_path(""images/svg/some.svg"")`

The code we use for finding assets is pretty naive without the asset pipeline, so I could imagine it being a mismatch between what we expect and what `gulp_asset_path` resolves to.

@paraboom I've considered adding support for remote paths, but actually decided it wasn't a good fit for this gem. There's a pretty big discussion in issue #17. 

I eventually went down the path of writing a separate JavaScript module ([remoteSvg](https://github.com/jamesmartin/remote-svg)) to do remote SVG embedding. It's not finished to the same level as this gem, but it's probably more suitable.

That said, if you have any ideas about how we could sensibly build remote path support into this gem, I'd love to hear them. Maybe open a separate issue, so we can discuss there.

> Also if the SVG file itself already has a title, but I pass a new title in through the options hash, I'd like it to overwrite the existing title in the SVG file, rather than adding an extra title to the element.

This sounds like a bug. I'll add a separate issue and get that fixed.

As for the accessibility attributes, it probably make sense to build in the most common ones, but I can't commit to doing them immediately. 

If you're keen to add specific attributes, it's relatively easy to extend the behavior of inline_svg by adding [custom transformations](https://github.com/jamesmartin/inline_svg#custom-transformations).

For example, to add the `role=""img""` attribute you could write a custom transformation like this:

``` ruby

# .role_attribute.rb
class RoleAttribute < InlineSvg::CustomTransformation
  def transform(doc)
    if value
      doc = Nokogiri::XML::Document.parse(doc.to_html)
      svg = doc.at_css 'svg'
      svg['role'] = ""img""
    end
    doc
  end
end

# in an initializer, like ./config/initializers/inline_svg.rb
InlineSvg.configure do |config|
  config.add_custom_transformation(attribute: :role, transform: RoleAttribute)
end


# in your view...
inline_svg('my_svg.svg', role: true)
```

Custom transformations could also be used to add any of the other accessibility tags that you need in the interim.

- It's possible to extend the document transformation pipeline and achieve any one of your suggested solutions by writing a [custom transformation](https://github.com/jamesmartin/inline_svg#custom-transformations)

As a less automated workaround, one could completely remove the `<style>` tags from an SVG document and supply an external stylesheet to target and style each document's classes separately.

I think the usage of SVGs on the web, especially in embedded form, is relatively limited (compared to images and pure CSS). 

This gem is, in part, a response to finding it difficult to use SVGs in the real world. The original use-case was to have many of the same SVG displayed on a page, and styled differently (colors, sizes etc.) with external CSS, hence the need to embed and then add classes to the root-level document. I usually lean towards stripping out as much presentation information as possible, and doing all coloring, sizing etc. in external CSS. This gives the maximum flexibility.

Of course, if you're producing SVG documents for standalone use, then I can understand the desire to have embedded style information.

If you are generating millions (i am not kidding) of inline svg images with associated colliding style blocks, to create unique styles for all of them would probably cripple the browser.

So now I can exactly say: the thing is SVG image you are using. I don't now SVG as exactly, but I think that difference in headers. Look at this, please.

```
 <path fill=""#000000"" 
```

This means that your original CSS was lower precedent (less specific) than the existing `fill` attribute on the element and so the browser prioritized the `#000000` value. When you added the `svg > path` selector, your CSS rule was specific enough to override the `fill` attribute.

The reason your second SVG behaves the way you expect is because you no longer have the `fill` attribute on the `path` elements.

Does that make sense?

 If I'm reading that change correctly, it looks like we might be able to fall back to the [`Sprockets::Rails::Helper#resolve_asset_path`](https://github.com/rails/sprockets-rails/blob/93a45b1c463a063ec7cf4d160107b67aa3db7a1a/lib/sprockets/rails/helper.rb#L74) method when `config.assets.compile = false`.

The asset finder in `InlineSvg` is also configurable, you just need to pass it an object that responds to `find_asset` and returns a file-like object that responds to `pathname`:

For example, to implement a really naive asset finder that only looks for assets in the `./public/images/` directory, you could do this in an initializer:

``` ruby
class NaiveAssetFinder
  def self.find_asset(filename)
    new(filename)
  end

  attr_accessor :pathname

  def initialize(filename)
    @pathname = ""#{Rails.root.join('public', 'images', filename)}""
  end
end

InlineSvg.configure do |config|
  config.asset_finder = NaiveAssetFinder
end
```

In the next few days I'll try to make the default a little more resilient to this Sprockets change.

When `config.assets.compile = false` there is very little chance of getting a properly configured `Sprockets` instance. Assets are now being served as static files from the `public/assets/` directory and they could even be on a CDN or other remote host. There is no guarantee that we can get access to them.

Changing the default `config.after_initialize` in the railtie to `config.asset_finder = app.config.assets` prevents things from exploding, but we also won't be able to resolve asset paths when `config.assets.compile = false`.

To accommodate this scenario we might be able to provide a configurable asset finder to replace Sprockets, which behaves a little like [my previous example](https://github.com/jamesmartin/inline_svg/issues/25#issuecomment-148220993), except it uses the built-in Rails `asset_path` helpers to obtain the correct pathname. People choosing this option could configure the library like so:

``` ruby
InlineSvg.configure do |config|
  config.asset_finder = InlineSvg::StaticAssetFinder

1. Duplicate much of the server-side transformation logic into some companion Javascript code, which would be responsible for getting the remote SVG from the client's browser and doing the specified transformation client-side. The results could be cached using local storage, or similar.
2. Expose a rails server endpoint (perhaps via an engine), which would do the transformations and caching on behalf of the client-side Javascript. In this scenario, the Javascript would still be responsible for fetching the SVG from the remote URL, but could then pass the SVG to the rails server for transformation.
3. Keep all fetching and transforming on the server-side, but perform the work out-of-band of the page request/response cycle (some kind of queuing), then allow the client-side to poll the server for the file and receive it once the fetching/transforming is done.

There are benefits and drawbacks to each approach, so I want to think it through carefully before committing to one direction.

Looks like `inline_svg` believes Sprockets is not loaded in your Rails application. Have you configured the [Asset Pipeline](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html)?

Could you try opening a Rails console and pasting in your `Rails.application.config.assets` configuration, please?

Here's mine, as an example:

``` ruby

This package hasn't been changed in a while, so something changed in Atom recently which broke this package. I'm not really sure what that is and probably won't have time to look into it anytime soon due to personal reasons. With that in mind, downgrading Atom seems like a quick fix for folks who just want to continue working. A longer term solution would be for someone else to figure out what exactly changed in Atom that broke this package and then fix things (I'd be happy to review a pull request with a fix). An alternative is that you switch to some other Atom package for viewing PDFs, e.g. https://atom.io/packages/pdfjs-viewer or https://atom.io/packages/pdf-view-plus.

It's possible only an upgrade of the PDFjs version (which is currently 2-3 years behind the current release) will fix it. 

In general, this package tries to manage the view itself, so there's a lot of interaction with the core that is difficult to handle properly without investing a lot of time into learning PDFjs.

This plugin provides the `ctrl-shit-¬¥` (a bit strange, since in config file does appear `ctrl-shift-\'` as its shortcut, I guess this difference is related to OS keymap).

No, that wouldn't work for me. This package works with PDFs, not with latex files. So, you'd need provide a PDF that fails to load for you to demonstrate a problem (which I'd try to reproduce).

That's the canonical and recommended way of defining package-settings these days. `package.json` was the first place I went to add/edit settings, and I anticipate other users would do the same.

Early versions of Atom required authors to use JavaScript/CoffeeScript to define package settings (the same as you've been using), but a ""formal"" way to do this was then introduced. This has been the norm for quite some time: relocating the config was less about ""refactoring"" and more about ""modernisation"".

I was playing with this today and it seemed to work well and I didn't find anything major braking, so finger crossed! ü§û 

I did find one case where I didn't observe behavior I expected. Here's the scenario:

1. start Atom
1. make sure that the auto-reload-on-update configuration setting is disabled
1. open a PDF 
1. update the PDF on the filesystem. The PDF shouldn't auto-reload since the configuration setting is disabled
1. enable the auto-reload-on-update configuration setting
1. the PDF will not auto-update and clicking on the PDF in the list of files in the tree-view didn't trigger an update

Thank you for your reply! 
I think maybe you misunderstood my problem. There's no problem opening ""a.pdf"" or ""a.eps"", ""a.pdf"" is just a  intermediate product from ""a.vsdx"" to ""a.eps"". ''a.eps"" is the only figure used in ""test.tex"". The problem is that after building ""test.tex"", ""a.eps"" doesn't show up in ""test.pdf"", and the whole page where ""a.eps"" should be turns out to be blank. The image doesn't show up in ""test.pdf"" when I zoom in or out. But in acrobat DC, it turns out to be normal.

The problem doesn't manifest in pdf.js, the library on top of which package was built: https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/. I think that means that this package isn't doing something that it should be doing to handle this situation. I'm not sure what that is, though -- this package doesn't do anything special: it just reads bytes from the file, gives them to pdf.js, and tells pdf.js where to render those bytes.

Sorry for disturbing you again, but I want to share my solution in case other people come up with the same problem.

Eps files generated by other methods like matlab performs well, and inserting a pdf file as an image works too, so the problem must be in the conversion from pdf to eps. Practice proves that my guess is correct, and here's my solution:

when saving as a pdf to a eps file, click the settings button

change Color Handling from default to others(both are OK for me, except the default one)

Then click OK to save the settings and save the eps file.

The eps file generated does show up in pdf-view.

However, especially with long documents (and not so long ones, actually, depending on the hardware) where the load time is noticeable, this behavior is very annoying. I used `pdf-view` for a while and currently I'm not using it anymore precisely for this reason. 

Thus, while the current behavior is technically correct, I think something better can be achieved. Here is an idea. A settings switch to disable the automatic reload itself would do the trick. Latex Atom plugins (`latextools` at least, which is the one I use) by themselves already open the resulting pdf on a ""viewer"" when the pdf is ready. E.g. if the selected viewer is `pdf-view` instead of an external program, and no pdf is currently open, a new tab is open with the pdf file displayed in it. I suppose this happens also when the tab is already opened, and by the way, this is currently causing yet another useless reload, because `pdf-view` reloads the pdf when it changes and then is asked to reload it again. This means that, by giving the option of disabling the auto reload, the reload would happen only once, at the end, when the latex plugin requests it.

From what I can see they (both [`latextools`](https://github.com/msiniscalchi/atom-latextools) and [`latex`](https://github.com/thomasjo/atom-latex)) always call `atom.workspace.open` with the pdf file, which works as expected when the file is not already open. But if the pdf is already open in some other tab, from what I can understand, `atom.workspace.open` doesn't give any signal to `pdf-view` package and the pdf is not updated if auto reload is turned off.

       I came across the same issue (the 'blinking' of the `pdf-view` when compiling using latex). As it was mentioned above, it is an expected behavior that `pdf-view` updates the pdf when compiling. However, it is annoying, and from user perspective, it is not necessary to show  the result of every step of the compilation. I understand that this is not the issue of `pdf-view` nor the latex compiler since they do both their job. @recluze  mentioned using a temporary file to store the intermediate changes of the pdf before finally updating the pdf file. I think it is a reasonable solution.

I read [this update](https://github.com/izuzak/atom-pdf-view/pull/192) where `auto-reload on update` option is added. However, when unchecked, no update to pdf is done, which is the job. I do want to see the final changes of the pdf.

I don't know if I missed something in the conversation, but it would be better if `pdf-view` updates the pdf only when the compilation is done and not after each intermediate step (since latex does many updates).

I use [latex package](https://github.com/thomasjo/atom-latex) for compilation.

I also would like to have this feature. I might have some time to work on this (i.e. to procrastinate while writing my dissertation).

I have a question for @izuzak:
Is it possible to reuse part the PDF.js web viewer (specifically the page viewer component)?
It seems that it already implements everything needed to support any kind of links and annotations.

Currently, pdf-viewer has a PdfEditorView extending a basic ScrollView.
It could extend PDFjs's PdfPageView... Of course, the pdf-viewer functionality already implemented would possibly need to be adapted...

1. Do you have `pdf_file.pdf` and `pdf_file.synctex.gz` available and in the same folder?

Since the zoom issue I was running into was with embedded figures, I'll move my efforts here instead.)

I've traced the bug to [this line](https://github.com/izuzak/atom-pdf-view/blob/c6078d9ef490221f7220425e30504adbf36c69b2/lib/pdf-editor-view.js#L384) in `pdf-editor-view.js`. On a pixel-doubled / ""retina"" screen, that line is supposed to double the size / resolution of the rendered image. However the change in scaling doesn't apply to certain embedded figures (possibly those that involve running the `beginGroup`‚Äì`endGroup` pair in pdf.js) because they seem to be drawn based on `context._transformMatrix`, which is only defined in pdf.js and thus unaffected by the default `scale` method. These figures end up being drawn at the 1x coordinates, hence appearing small and displaced.

It's only after the initial invocation of `context.scale` that pdf.js initializes the context properly and overwrites the `scale` method with `ctxScale`, which does interact with `_transformMatrix`. On subsequent renders the call `context.scale(2,2)` doubles the entries of `context._transformMatrix` each time, and so the figures get drawn at 2x, 4x, 8x, etc.

Note that ovirtanen's screenshot here and fabianp's on the other issue was taken on a retina display, while jiaweiw's wasn't.

I have to zoom in or out to be able to ""read"" it whatever the rate. The minimum and maximium zoom level for which it works seems to be always the same for all pdfs.

I tried several different pdf files. Does it could be a font issue ? Acutually, in all pdf I have tried, pictures or figures are right but text are wrong. For example, I have a set of latex/tikz pictures where all shapes are right but text is not rendered. This is another pdf for example :

That's strange -- I'm having trouble reproducing this on OSX and Atom 1.6.2 -- here's a side-by-side view of pdf-view and pdf.js in Chrome (the library pdf-view uses to render pdfs):

Both look fine to me. It might be a Linux issue, but there's nothing Linux-specific in pdf-view -- it just uses the pdf.js library to render pdfs.

Perhaps this is a problem in pdf.js and has been fixed in one of the more recent versions of the library. If someone wants to try updating pdf-view to use a more recent version of pdf.js and see if that helps -- I'd be happy to review a pull request.

I'm a bit confused about how all of this is supposed to work. It seems that half of the implementation is here and half is in your fork of the atom-latex package (not even in the atom-latex package itself).

So, if someone installs just pdf-view, they can't really use this, even if half of the functionality is here. That doesn't sound right to me and it wouldn't really close #107 in my opinion. You shouldn't need to install other packages to use this in pdf-view. And again, it seems that the other half is only in your fork for atom-latex, not in the package itself. 

Do you think it would be possible to make forward sync within this package alone?

As to why the functionality is split in two; it's because this is how synctex support is usually handled. The PDF viewer exposes the syncing functionality, but it is the editor's job to initiate the sync. This is how both atom-latex and atom-latextools handle forward syncing with other PDF viewers; they provide a command/keybinding that then syncs the editor's position to the PDF.

The way I see it atom-pdf-view should be responsible for what happens when a user has the PDF focused. What happens when the user is editing latex should be handled by latex plugins.

But this is just my opinion and if you disagree, I'll be happy to modify the PR and include for example a keybinding that, when editing a latex file, will trigger a forward sync to PDF (which might clash with latex packages' functionality), or whichever way you want it done. :smile:

I think I'd still like to see this implemented completely in pdf-view. I guess it comes down to this question: would it be possible and would it be useful to have this functionality even if you don't have an additional latex package installed? I think the answer to both of those questions in ""yes"". I shouldn't need to install a package for compiling latex documents (which is what atom-latex is for) in order to get a sync behavior between the source file and the PDF (that would be useful even if I'm not re-compiling the PDF). I'd expect that sync to work even without such a package or with any other latex package that comes along in the future.

That said, I think there's no downside in having this merged so that you could perhaps open a pull request to update atom-latex as well and move forward with this. We can always revisit the have-everything-in-pdfview idea later.

It works _(or breaks)_ better on larger documents; especially, seemingly, with different fonts rendering on the same page, and complicated layouts. (My main document is mainly programming notes, but I don't think it would be wise if I share it. :unamused: sorry. If you want, I can try getting a screen shot of that with a bogus page; though it would take me a while.) I first found it when I accidentally scrolled and pressed control-0 to reset my zoom. I can reliably reproduce the image clones to have 4 at a time: 2 upside down, overlapping on some parts, 2 right side up, overlapping. I can tell it's redrawn twice because, in addition to me being able to see the new sections appear relatively slowly, (relative to expected computer speeds with native programs,) the double-drawn areas are bold. The pdf.js scripts seems to rework the HTML every time it is resized, and continues until finished. I think it's the HTML because I can scroll around whilst glitched (Even the other pages are glitched when this happens!) The problem here seems to be that on resize, nothing tells the previous pdf.js threads to stop; so they keep on going on. Though, I still don't know how it gets upside down, or why it seems like atom scales it strangely.
I have a screen shot with basically a 47-page lorem document (I tried with 7-page version, this breaks better) with a slight amount of some sections and chapters.

As requested here is the information:
Pdf file - https://feupload.fe.up.pt/get/1cG14LYWo67DEY8
Atom version: 1.3.2
OS version: OS X Yosemite (10.10.5)
Version output:

```
~ $ apm -v
apm  1.4.1
npm  2.13.3
node 0.10.40
python 2.7.10
git 2.4.9

This issue was only detected after generating the pdf from the latex code, though I have rendered a few other latex projects and this is first time it happened. Haven't found this issue with any other pdf files.
Happy to provide any additional information if need be.

P.S: Found the following error in the atom dev console, perhaps it may help you

I don't see a `getActiveEditor` defined on workspace. As far as I can tell, there's such a method defined on `Pane`:

https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/62f4f32d237097b18e66a7fc2f00eb3a805739ef/src/pane.coffee#L288-L289. 

Can you clarify what you're referring to exactly?

Also, can you explain why you can't use this: `atom.workspace().getActivePaneItem().getPath()`? That way, you can work with text editors and non-text editors. Embedding pdf-view within a text editor seems like a much messier solution to your problem than using `getActivePaneItem().getPath()`. pdf-view implements this method:

I was just testing this and noticed a few things:
1. This seems to break synctex support which was added in https://github.com/izuzak/atom-pdf-view/pull/87. Basically, with synctex support -- when you click on a line in a PDF generated from tex source, that tex source file is opened and the cursor is put on the exact line in the source code which was clicked in the PDF. On this branch, clicking on a line of text doesn't do anything, I'm guessing because of the things you added for handling selections. Before we merge this, I think we should make sure it doesn't break any of the existing functionality. Could you look into that when you find some time?
2. As you mentioned, it's hard to make this work well for all PDFs. I noticed that in a lot of cases (but not all) when I use the mouse to start selecting from the start of the line to the end of the line -- selection stops about 4-5 characters before the end of the line. See this GIF:
   
   ![selecting](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/38924/11168449/c5a3394c-8b8f-11e5-9753-c634329b776c.gif)
   
   I don't think this in itself is a blocker for getting this merged, but I would like to put this feature behind a [config setting](https://github.com/izuzak/atom-pdf-view/blob/79b42bd5fd323ef8d046080f4a23934d402bf316/lib/pdf-editor.coffee#L12-L22) which would be disabled by default (until we're confident that it's working well and not causing any problems). That way, anyone can use this great feature, but they can easily enable and disable it if they want. What do you think?

Thanks again!

I will look into that.

I think adding an item in config for enabling text layer is a good idea. There is indeed some problem in positioning the text layer on top of pdf canvas, which is probably the reason for the peculiar behavior when selecting text.

There is however another possible reason to such problem - the font ascent and descent attributes are not properly set when generating the pdf. Although PDF.js developers claim to have solved the problem (see mozilla/pdf.js#4665), the problem still exists for some documents. I have encountered [one such document](https://uofi.box.com/s/ngi66s72jtfadankk740efxzvhofqg5q). Download it and try opening it in Firefox (or PDF.js viewer) and select some text, you would see the text layer is about 20 pixels above the actual text in canvas... What I've discovered so far is that pdfs converted from LaTeX works pretty well in PDF.js.

Perhaps one should think about adding `\s*` at the beginning and the end of the line to get more robust or just call `trim()` before evalutating the regular expression.

I could cherry-pick that commit, but I think it's better if we do this through a new PR. Before we do that, I'm wondering if you could clarify one thing:

> The regular expression is not valid if there is a CR at the end of the line and there m is null.

If there is a CR at the end of that line, wouldn't that still be matched by the `(.*)` in the regex? A `.` matches anything, right? So `line.match /^([a-zA-Z]*):(.*)$/` should match any line beginning with letters and a colon afterwards because `(.*)` will match anything until the end of the line. I definitely might be wrong, I normally am when regexes are involved. :smile: 

Still, the line number would not be correct because it would contain a CR at the end, which I think is what @autc04 was referring to.

Nope, looks like I was wrong -- the match will fail if there's a CR there, the dot doesn't match it. Just tried it out.

I think `atom.workspace.getActivePane()?.activate()` might work. See:

https://atom.io/docs/api/v1.1.0-beta.0/Workspace#instance-getActivePane
https://atom.io/docs/api/v1.1.0-beta.0/Pane#instance-activate

Does that allow you to trigger the desired behavior?

There already is such a command, but not in pdf-view -- it's a general command for all files:

```
atom.workspace.open(""path/to/file.pdf"")
```

Atom then opens the file with the correct ""opener"" for that file type. If you have pdf-view installed and a the file ends with `.pdf`, then [pdf-view's opener is triggered](https://github.com/izuzak/atom-pdf-view/blob/44a74abc5317041a017f29fb1b205efe0d77562d/lib/pdf-editor.coffee#L6).

It uses the following tex file:

> \documentclass{article}
> \usepackage{lipsum}
> \begin{document}
> \lipsum[1-100]
> \end{document}

First I turned it into a pdf (pdflatex repro.tex) and created a python script that touched it periodically while it was open in atom.io, but atom would not reload it (I do not know how the reload mechanism works).
Instead, I rewrote the python script to recreate the pdf every time. Here is the python script

> #usage example: python repro.py repro.tex 50 2
> import sys,subprocess,time,shutil
> file = sys.argv[1]; count = int(sys.argv[2]); interv = int(sys.argv[3]);
> for i in range(count):
>   print '{}/{}{}'.format(i+1, count, '\n' if i%24==0 else ''),
>   sys.stdout.flush()
>   pop = subprocess.Popen([""pdflatex"", 'repro.tex'], stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
>   pop.wait()
>   time.sleep(interv)

While I ran the script I observed visible reloading in atom.io. The memory of atom helper went up and down, but it did not increase in general. Hence, I conclude that the out of memory problem is not due to pdf-view, but due to atom.io, it could probably be related to this: https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/1827

1) I did a few tests with pdf.js and saw no issues with the attached pdf. In combination with atom, the viewing of the attached pdf resulted in a vanishing embedded image, while chaning the zoom. I should note, that I am not an expert on pdf.js.

That PDF you uploaded doesn't seem to be available anymore, but I think I know what you're saying. I've observed this as well when zooming a complex page several times very quickly -- it's as if the re-renderings of the page for different zoom-levels get mixed up or something.

Definitely sounds like something that should be fixed in this package, since pdf.js doesn't have that problem. I probably won't have time to dig into this in the near future, so if someone else wants to contribute a patch for this -- I'd be happy to review and merge. 

One thing I've observed is that zooming slowly helps prevent this from happening. So, instead of pressing `cmd +` or `cmd -` very quickly two or three times, I just press it once, and then once again after the the previous zoom completed.

I think I understand what you're describing, and I guess it's possible this happens. I still wish I could reproduce this, though. Have you been able to reliably reproduce the problem with a specific latex document and specific changes made to the document? 

Regardless of that, I think we can give this a try. :+1: Before we do, I wanted to run one other idea by you.

Currently, the `debounce` call in `onFileChangeCallback` is set to wait 100ms for any other calls to that callback before invoking `updatePdf`. It seems to me that we might increase that wait period (e.g. to 1s) to make this problem appear less frequently. If a change happens for a file and then no other changes happen for 100ms -- then the file will be updated in pdf-view. But if a change happens soon after those 100 ms pass and while the file is being updated -- then the problem surfaces, right? So, we could wait for a bit longer for changes to happen. When combined with your fix in this PR, this would prevent the file from being re-updated frequently, e.g. if a file changes 10 times with 105ms between two changes then the file would be re-rendered 10 times, right? But if we increase the wait period to 500-100s, then only one render would happen, which might be a better experience.

What do you think?

Compile the file with `pdflatex membrane-surface.tex`, open `membrane-surface.pdf` in pdf-view and the recompile the file. This gives me a black pane in >90% of runs.

This is why this file exposes the bug: The LaTeX drawing at the beginning of the document takes a long time to compile and triggers a rerendering immediately after LaTeX has finished this part of the document. Rendering the document takes a long time, again because of that drawing. The final few paragraphs of text are compiled relatively fast and LaTeX finishes compiling before rerendering has finished.

It seems like a good idea to increase the debounce timeout. But one second is a bit too long in my opinion. Some users might be compiling a simple LaTeX file which takes only about half a second to compile. I think it would be bad user experience to make them wait for 1.5 seconds instead of 0.5 seconds to see the changes to the document.

> e.g. if a file changes 10 times with 105ms between two changes then the file would be re-rendered 10 times, right?

Only if rendering takes < 105ms. If it takes longer, the file will be rerendered fewer times. One of my documents currently takes 300ms to render.

Another idea: One could use the file size heurestic to guess when LaTeX (or another program) has finished compiling: it has finished when the file size of the PDF is roughly the same as after the last successful rendering. Of course the file size can change, for example when the user adds an image to the document. This might be combined with a flexible debounce timeout: If the file is still smaller than after the last rerender, then a larger timespan without change is needed to trigger a render than when the file size roughly matches the full size after the last rerendering.

One last idea: The ""right"" debounce timeout could be dynamically determined on a per-document basis. One could remember how long the longest pause between two file changes was where rendering wasn't successful after the first change.

Finally, it might not be so bad to rerender often: It isn't apparent from the user interface that pdf-view tries to rerender the document multiple times while it's being updated. All the user sees is a black pane, no flickering etc.

Can you still reproduce this in Atom 0.199.0? If so, can you provide a sample tex file and clarify which change exactly you make to trigger this problem? It's possible I'm making ""wrong"" changes and not triggering the error somehow. Thanks again! :bow:

I'm using pdf-view to see the compiled PDF beside the LaTeX source in Atom. Randomly, after compiling the LaTeX file, pdf-view fails to reload the PDF.

The issue seems to be that pdflatex writes the PDF continuously as it is compiling. (Some PDF viewers don't handle this well: for example, when you view a PDF in Mac OS X's Preview, and you switch to the window with the PDF file while regenerating that file with pdflatex, Preview crashes.) After looking at the code of pdf-view, I've got an idea of what's probably going on:
1. I start rebuilding my document: `pdflatey mydocument.tex`
2. pdflatex begins writing `mydocument.pdf`
3. atom-view detects the file change and begins reloading and rerendering the document
4. pdflatex finishes compiling
5. atom-view finishes rerendering the document, which results in a blank screen, because the version it tried to render wasn't a correct PDF file

The problem seems to be that file changes that occur while atom-view is refreshing do not trigger a new refresh.

@frxstrem This workaround may help in the meantime: This script builds the PDF file in a separate directory and moves the finished PDF into place afterwards (if there wasn't an error).

``` sh
#!/bin/sh

set -e
pdflatex -output-directory output mydocument.tex
cp output/mydocument.pdf .

I still get the same result after updating pdf-view and restarting Atom, but I don't get the black regions in the online viewer (using Chrome).

I tried switching themes in Atom, and it seems that the color of the ""black"" regions depend on the background color of the pane (as shown on the left side below). Switching to a lighter theme also made the black regions lighter:

It seemed to produce the same regions (just white) as in pdf-view when viewed in Chrome 41 (the version used by Atom), but not after updating to Chrome 42. I assume that there therefore is a bug in pdf.js and not in pdf-view, and that may be fixed as Atom updates to Chrome 42. Until then, the workaround I found involved changing the canvas background color to `white` (which works most of the time since most documents have a white background):

``` less

seems like the build string expand thingy uses the current git commit, but for some of us there is no git repo holding pdf.js so this fails...

The only thing I can say is that in the previous version of your plugin it seemed to be fine except that if I was in the pdf tab while it was being generated it would give an error when the pdf was changed.
In the current version this error doesn't occur but the pdf gets all weird even when I'm not in the tab, although the error message disappeared.

I also noticed that the pdf has now more quality :smile:, maybe it is something related with what you are using to load the pdf. For example if it grabs the pdf file before it is completed it may generate a faulty view. Maybe if you delay the reload a bit it may fix the issue.

This is just a complete guess, based on the fact that if I close and open the tab again it is completely fine again.

It is an issue with asynchronous loading and rendering with workers. With previous synchronous version every content-changed event was handled only after rendering finished. In v0.13 pdf loading and rendering are partially handled in a separate thread. Page image is getting corrupted because of multiple simultaneous transformations to canvas by different updates.

I haven't looked at the code yet, but I did try it out and seems to be working great. Noticed just a few minor issues:
1. the page indicator/selector in the status bar is not visible immediately after loading a PDF, but is shown after scrolling. (Currently, that indicator/selector is visible as soon as you open a PDF).  
2. for PDFs that have different-sized pages, jumping to a page might not land you on the top of the page (which would be expected behavior), but rather somewhere else if those pages haven't been loaded yet. I'm not sure if this can be fixed -- since pages are no longer loaded all at once, you don't know what the sizes of all pages before they are visible. So, jumping to some page might be incorrect because some pages that haven been loaded might have a different height.
3. for PDFs that have different-sized pages, zooming and then scrolling to a page of different height causes jumpy behavior.

I've put together a quick PDF which I used for testing -- you can find it [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/w31rp9q0mwl7eu6/test.pdf?dl=0).

If you have any ideas about fixing these problems -- that would be :sparkles: amazing :sparkles:. Also, if you'd like to split this large PR into several smaller PRs (one for each of the three improvements) -- that might be helpful for testing and working on individual features. Some of these can probably be merged right away.

Thank you for your feedback! I will make separate PRs for workers and HiDPI shortly. The issues are  mostly caused by rendering only visible pages. 

Speaking of which. Here we have this on-demand rendering issue, and then - text-layer-related issues #6, #7. Then we'll want to add e.g. hyperlinks and scroll-to-pdf-object for synctex. Actually we‚Äôll be reimplementing a full-featured pdf viewer. Won't it be more beneficial to try embedding pdf.js bundled viewer to Atom? It is well supported and it has, I think, the most extensive list of features possible with pdf.js engine. At the first look it seems that it could be enough to just embed viewer in iframe.

As far as I know - none. If you'd like to take look -- please do and let me know if you notice anything. 

Since I can't reproduce the problem on the OS which I'm using (OSX), I'm unsure where to start with debugging this problem. It might not be a problem in this package, but something in Atom, a dependency, your configuration, or a combination of those three. If you have any suggestions, let me know.

The document, even when zoomed in, does not render fonts clearly... It is simply a lower resolution version of the same PDF.

I have seen an issue before regarding PDF.js documents being blurry (and it being fixed upstream) and noticed the version of PDF.js used by PDF view is not the latest.

I wish I could reproduce this, but I don't have a retina screen handy and that seems relevant (I don't see the blurriness on my non-retina screen).

I'd like to ask you to try a few things and let me know if they help, when you find some time for debugging. First, try upgrading to the latest version of Atom (0.129.0) and see if that helps. I suspect it won't, but it's worth making sure.

You also mentioned that you noticed a similar issue fixed in upstream PDF.js. Could you please link to a relevant issue, pull request or commit (I tried finding it, but failed). Also, could you try installing pdf-view locally, updating it to the latest version of pdf.js and see if that helps? Here's what you'd need to do:
1. Uninstall pdf-view: `apm uninstall pdf-view`
2. Clone this project: `git clone https://github.com/izuzak/atom-pdf-view/`
3. `cd atom-pdf-view`
4. Edit the package.json file and change the version number for the [pdf.js reference](https://github.com/izuzak/atom-pdf-view/blob/b3372f51829cd3431280eb77c644a1348cc29ab9/package.json#L17). Currently, that version is 4834f1c28924b3322f00b8383ddb8478193be930, and the latest version of pdf.js is [d66314cfb3a07c70f8385dd58ad7d872591ac8f5](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/commit/d66314cfb3a07c70f8385dd58ad7d872591ac8f5). So, use that version number instead. 
5. Build and install: `apm install`
6. Link the local version: `apm link`
7. Start Atom and see if anything changed with regard to the blurriness
8. Quit Atom
9. Unlink the local version: `apm unlink`

Thanks again for your help in investigating this! :tophat:

Ahhh, right. Could you try something for me, to verify a potential solution:
1. git clone `https://github.com/izuzak/atom-pdf-view/`
2. cd into `atom-pdf-view`
3. edit the `package.json` file so that the pdf.js dependency uses `git+https://...` and not just `git://...`
4. run `apm install` and let me know if it installs the package properly

That should work as far as I can tell, but just want to double-check before committing changes. Thanks again!

I'm not super-opposed to it and I do agree that the smaller size would be a benefit. 

Still, having it this way makes more sense to me at the moment. For example, when I want to update to a new version of pdf.js -- the pull request for that would probably be huge and not be relevant for this project (because it would show the diff between two version of the bundled version). Just bumping the SHA of the commit for which version of pdf.js is cleaner and simpler _for humans_.

The basic idea is to overlay the canvas the pdf gets rendered into with a div in that the selections get rendered into. These will both get updated via promises when the page is changed.

    return Promise.all([renderTask.promise, textLayerPromise]);

.pdfPage {

    overflow: visible;
    border: 1px solid #000000;
}

.pdfPage > canvas {
    position: absolute;

The examples are a bit confusing because hello world creates the canvas in HTML and the text selection example in javascript. Also, the text selection example uses three wrapper functions that basically do the same thing as in hello world.

Apparently the way Mozilla deals with this is just creating div elements for each of the object, so that collectively the text layer still resembles the contents. While this would work for copying to Microsoft Word or TextEdit, it behaves abnormally in Atom as all text contents are aggregated into one single line, whitespaces and newlines mysteriously lost... [Mozilla's demo](http://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/web/viewer.html) exhibits the same problem, and I'm still trying to find a solution.

So far I've only been able to get the text layer working. Copying any content from Atom to external text editor works with formatting preserved, but not within Atom if the destination is a TextEditor instance.

Back in 2018, https://github.com/pqrs-org/Karabiner-Elements/issues/545 led me to remove the dependency on Karabiner-Elements and implement everything with Hammerspoon, and I shipped that change in [jasonrudolph/keyboard v4.0.0](https://github.com/jasonrudolph/keyboard/releases/tag/v4.0.0).

That worked, but I found the UX of that particular implementation to be inferior as described in #38. (Perhaps there's an alternative Hammerspoon-based implementation that would provide UX comparable to the Karabiner-Elements implementation, but I'm not aware of such an implementation.) So once https://github.com/pqrs-org/Karabiner-Elements/issues/545 was resolved, #38 reinstated the use of Karabiner-Elements.

The problems described in #40, #59, and #60 were also side effects of removing the dependency on Karabiner-Elements. https://github.com/jasonrudolph/keyboard/pull/61 resolved those issues by porting (S)uper (D)uper Mode from Hammerspoon to Karabiner-Elements.

With that in mind, I will likely postpone my personal upgrade to Big Sur until https://github.com/pqrs-org/Karabiner-DriverKit-VirtualHIDDevice is capable of supporting all the existing functionality in this repository.

I hope that helps.

https://github.com/jasonrudolph/keyboard/blob/3bee475a114f2e2697d536676d96f77bafb26b2e/hammerspoon/markdown.lua#L106-L112

You could use a similar approach to change [`super.lua`](https://github.com/jasonrudolph/keyboard/blob/v5.0.0/hammerspoon/super.lua) to trigger (S)uper (D)uper Mode with a single keystroke. It will be a bit of work, but it's do-able if you put your mind to it. üòÖ

I tried this branch out locally, and it works great for most apps, but some apps seem to have trouble with this functionality. For example, in the default bindings that ship with jasonrudolph/keyboard, <kbd>hyper</kbd>+<kbd>t</kbd> opens iTerm:

With the changes in this pull request, <kbd>hyper</kbd>+<kbd>t</kbd> still focuses the frontmost iTerm window, but pressing <kbd>hyper</kbd>+<kbd>t</kbd> again does not cycle iTerm's other windows. Notably, if I press <kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>`</kbd>, it _does_ cycle iTerm's other windows.

I noticed a similar issue with Visual Studio Code.

Currently, (S)uper (D)uper Mode looks for specific English characters. For example:

When using an English keyboard, this works. When using a non-English keyboard, it doesn't work. Thanks for identifying this issue! :bow:

If anyone has some time to investigate a fix, I think this could be resolved by updating [`super.lua`](https://github.com/jasonrudolph/keyboard/blob/2d2b159f071f7a0461874defd4ba966974aa72a8/hammerspoon/super.lua) to look at keycodes instead of characters. For example, the excerpt above would become something like this:

```lua
  local keyCode = event:getKeyCode()

  if keyCode == hs.keycodes.map['s'] then
```

You can see the related API docs at:

- https://www.hammerspoon.org/docs/hs.eventtap.event.html#getKeyCode
- https://www.hammerspoon.org/docs/hs.keycodes.html#map

There are a handful of places where `super.lua` currently uses `event:getCharacters()`, so all of those places will likely need to be updated to use keycodes instead.

This (is the workaround I found: instead of standalone Hammerspoon I
installed it via 'brew install cask'. This way some problems disappeared. I
have not tested further since it is working now.

I think this is a cool idea, so I tried this out for a couple weeks. However, I never found it fitting into my day-to-day workflow.

I also frequently ran into issues like the one you were facing in 7e9752175c0ea708951cefef78b9ca5b1d4af432. Because some apps don't allow you to size them exactly at 40%/50%/60%, I found myself having to increase the delta from 5 pixels to 10 pixels.

It seems like you already have an existing configuration folder for karabiner at `/Users/im/.config/karabiner`. You'll need to move, remove, or change the name of that folder and then run `script/setup` again.

https://github.com/jasonrudolph/keyboard/pull/41 will probably work for you most of the time, but it's susceptible to a race condition as described in https://github.com/jasonrudolph/keyboard/pull/41#issuecomment-406087831.

Basically, remove the triggers in super duper mode in Hammerspoon, and expose a way to toggle super duper mode via the command line (see https://www.hammerspoon.org/docs/hs.ipc.html#cliInstall).

I did it by exporting the `superDuperMode` table which contains the `superDuperMode:enter()` and `superDuperMode:reset()` functions:

```lua
-- ... the rest of the super duper module ...

-- Expose superDuperMode so we can control it from other modules (and the CLI).
return superDuperMode

That's a very personal choice. üòá  There are probably as many opinions on that matter as their are programmers. üò¨ 

With that in mind, I can only offer [my personal opinion](https://github.com/jasonrudolph/keyboard/tree/f76f389d1667fa3767aad50cf658c6cce22fcaf1#more-useful-for-me). Personally, I use [Atom](https://atom.io/) as my primary editor, and I use [(S)uper (D)uper Mode](https://github.com/jasonrudolph/keyboard/tree/f76f389d1667fa3767aad50cf658c6cce22fcaf1#super-duper-mode)'s vim keys to navigate left/down/up/right in Atom and in every other app on my Mac. As [noted in the README](https://github.com/jasonrudolph/keyboard/tree/f76f389d1667fa3767aad50cf658c6cce22fcaf1#toward-a-more-useful-keyboard), I value that consistency:

> I want the _same_ (more useful) keyboard in every app.
> Ubiquitous keyboarding.
> Muscle memory.
> [Don't make me think][don't-make-me-think].
>
> How do I go to the beginning of the line in this app?
> The same way I go to the beginning of the line in _every_ app!
> Don't make me think.
>
> How do I go to the top of the file/screen/page in this app?
> The same way I...
> Well, you get the point.

:smile:

That said, for those times when I'm ssh'ed into a server, and there's no Atom in sight, I find it valuable to be able to get around and perform basic editing in vim. Vim is definitely my preferred *terminal-based* editor.

I hope this helps.

> ""Ghosting"" is the problem that some keyboard keys don't work when multiple keys are pressed simultaneously. The key presses that don't show up on the computer or seem to have disappeared are said to have been ""ghosted"". On most keyboards, even some that are explicitly marketed as ""Anti-Ghosting,"" this happens with many three key combinations.

You can use an [online tool](https://www.microsoft.com/appliedsciences/content/projects/KeyboardGhostingDemo.aspx) to test whether your keyboard is capable of simultaneously sending `s` + `d` + `space` + `h`. To perform the test:

1. Quit Hammerspoon
1. Open https://www.microsoft.com/appliedsciences/content/projects/KeyboardGhostingDemo.aspx
1. Click the keyboard image on that page
1. Hold down `s` and verify that you see the `s` key highlighted on the keyboard
1. Hold down `d` and verify that you see the `d` key highlighted on the keyboard
1. Hold down `space` and verify that you see the `space` key highlighted on the keyboard
1. Hold down `h` and verify that you see the `h` key highlighted on the keyboard

On my Kinesis Freestyle 2, all of the steps above work. However, some keyboards are incapable of sending all four of those keystrokes.

I suspect keyboard ghosting is the source of this problem, so I'm going to close this issue. If a keyboard can't send those four keystrokes simultaneously, then Hammerspoon won't have any way of knowing that those keys are being pressed. üò¶ However, if you run through the steps above, and you see that your keyboard *is* sending all four keystrokes simultaneously, please let me know and we'll re-open this issue.

- [`hammerspoon/control-escape.lua`](https://github.com/jasonrudolph/keyboard/blob/6e262992a1d76d9efff8aaf99981cf7e2729a762/hammerspoon/control-escape.lua) makes it so that *tapping* **control** triggers **escape**.

Prior to Sierra, this functionality :point_up: relied on Karabiner's [Simultaneous VI Mode](https://github.com/tekezo/Karabiner/blob/8fe38da09ff0f05e20e0f4cde80258435bfcad47/src/core/server/Resources/include/checkbox/simultaneouskeypresses_vi_mode.xml). Since [Karabiner-Elements doesn't yet support Simultaneous VI Mode](https://github.com/tekezo/Karabiner-Elements/issues/153), this pull request implements the functionality via Hammerspoon.

@adamyonk: I think this might be a quirk of the implementation and/or poor documentation on my part. üò¨ 

With the current implementation, you need to:

1. Press caps lock + w
2. Release caps lock + w
3. Press the desired window movement key (e.g., h)

That _should_ do the trick. With that flow, you should see something like this in the Hammerspoon console:

```
13:10:17     hotkey: Disabled hotkey F20
             hotkey: Disabled hotkey F16
             hotkey: Enabled hotkey F20
             hotkey: Enabled hotkey F16
```

Based on the console output you showed, I'm _guessing_ that you're not performing step 2. (Again, this is likely due to me not yet providing sufficient docs. üôà ) Could this explain the behavior you're seeing?

In my experience, it doesn't matter if the `Control` key fires in the first example. I tap and release `Caps Lock` to trigger `Escape`. It triggers `Escape`. (Cool.) If it also triggers `Control`, that has no consequences that I'm aware of. `Control` is only meaningful (in my experience) when used in combination with other keys (like the last example shows).

I'm not sure I understand the need for it in this library, it seems more like a helper method that's very specific to your use-case, but I'd love to hear more.

Yes, of course. If we use actions-toolkit in TypeScript we want to check types and  narrow down types.

There is a common pattern for that in JavaScript: using `assert` functions. This is especially useful in scripts, where in branches we just exit with failure. And main branch for successful path.
But TypeScript can't understand that we did checks.

```ts
// get version from inputs, it has type string | undefined
const version: string | undefined = '0.63.2'
assert (version !== undefined, 'Invalid version')
const str: string = version // TypeScript didn't understand that in assert we checked types. version is still string | undefined
```
If using with available API
```ts
// get version from inputs, it has type string | undefined
const version: string | undefined = '0.63.2'
if (version === undefined) {
  tools.exit.failure('version is undefined')
}

const str: string = version // TypeScript didn't understand that common pattern. version is still string | undefined
```

For that case TypeScript added assertion control flow analysis support https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/32695",NA,https://api.github.com/repos/JasonEtco/actions-toolkit/issues/130/comments,https://github.com/JasonEtco/actions-toolkit/pull/130#issuecomment-668705430,https://api.github.com/repos/JasonEtco/actions-toolkit/issues/130

To be honest, this seems like a very specific use-case, one that I'd hesitate to add to a library like actions-toolkit. I'd recommend just using a helper function in your own app code to do the same thing:

Yes, that's possible solution. But I've decided to make pull request exactly as exit functions merely do the same. They just wrap Node.js `process.exit()`. 

The only they do on top of that is logging messages with different log level. I thought if you've added them you wanted to have unified high-level API and, possibly, do not interact with broad low-level API.

The same intention behind assertion function. Instead of throwing exceptions as Node.js asset do, worrying about broad Node.js Assert API or fighting with type guards it allows do this in s simple way.

Not many developers know assert function doesn't reduce type. Moreover assertion functions are not well known.

I see what you're saying - I'd opt to have two properties:

```ts
class Context {
  get issue_number () { return this.payload.issue?.number }
  get pull_number () { return this.payload.pull_request?.number }
}
```

These would be simple getters that look for `payload.(issue|pull_request).number`. Then you'd use them _with_ `context.repo`:

```js
{
  ...context.repo,
  issue_number: context.issue_number
}
```

It's not as clean as have just one getter, but since the `issue_number/pull_number` keys are different I don't think there's a way to only have one. What do you think @mheap? The alternative, like you said, would be:

```ts
class Context {
  get issue () { return { ..this.repo, this.payload.issue?.number } }
  get pullRequest () { return { ...this.repo, this.payload.pull_request?.number } }

## More details

I can see two issues here:

### Where to pull the number from

This is covered by the PR in it's current state

### The format that we return the data in

I'd like to be able to do `...context.issue` or `...context.pullRequest` depending on if we're using an Issue or a PR endpoint.

`...context.issue` should use the implementation in this PR to extract `number` and return an `issue_number` key in the context.

So, it's trigger every time when comment created.
It works well. Btw i don't wanna call it each time when comment was created, i need only call it when comment created and contain 'build' (blue called when 'blue' is not exists

I have done something else helpful - by having a separate function that is my ""action code"" that takes a `Toolkit` argument, I can pass a mocked Toolkit in tests. I need to document this for #50, but it vaguely looks like this:

```js
module.exports = async tools => {

it('does something', async () => {
  const tools = new Toolkit()

  tools.getPackageJSON = jest.fn(() => ({ })

```ts

I can't imagine a use-case for an action wanting a scope logger as well as the regular one. I think we'll be better off doing something that's one way or the other, controlled more easily with an option.

One thing we talked about was writing the scope automatically based on the name of the action. We could do this, but automatically:

```js
const { Signale } = require('signale')
const tools = new Toolkit({
  logger: new Signale({ scope: process.env.GITHUB_ACTION })
})

This does the same thing, but you can set the scope directly in the constructor. We could alternatively do something like this and just pass the logger options to the `Signale` constructor:

```js
const tools = new Toolkit({
  loggerOptions: { scope: 'SOME SCOPE' }
})

Unfortunately, this totally borks in tests - I've tracked it down to be caused by the mock `fs`, since Signale tries to use it internally. I'm actually happy this came up, because I'm not sure that mocking `fs` is a good thing anyway - it means we're relying on our mocked logic instead of how `fs` really works.

I want to add some CLI tests but am having trouble figuring out an approach moving forward.

In a local branch, I added a `tests/cli.test.ts` file:

```ts
import execa from 'execa'

describe('CLI', () => {
  it('displays help when passed no arguments', () => {
    return execa('node', [require.resolve('../bin/actions-toolkit.js')]).catch(error => {
      expect(error.code).toBe(1)
      expect(error.message).toMatch(/Usage: npx actions-toolkit <name>/)
    })
  })
})
```

This test passes, but Jest shows the following warning:

```
(node:42520) MaxListenersExceededWarning: Possible EventEmitter memory leak detected. 11 exit listeners added. Use emitter.setMaxListeners() to increase limit
```

I don't know if that's something to worry about and continue to write CLI integration tests like this (mocking out the filesystem, process, etc. as needed on a per test basis), or if it would make more sense to refactor the CLI into a class, and then have the executable create the class and call a method - something roughly like:

```ts
// bin/ActionsToolkit.js
module.exports = class ActionsToolkit {
  constructor(argv) {
    this.args = parseArgs(argv)
  }

  async run() {
    if (!this.args.name) {
      this.printHelp()
      exit(1)
    }
    // do more stuff!
  }
}

// bin/cli.js
new ActionsToolkit(process.argv[2]).run()
```

This might be more testable to an extent, but it may not be a *true* integration test, since we wouldn't fully be testing the argument collection from `process.argv`. ü§î

Yeah, interesting point. I might be weird, but I typically mock out `Toolkit` in my tests to emulate the expected Actions environment with something like this (which allows me to test various error paths in my code):

```javascript
const tools = {
  context: {
    event: 'issues'
  }
};
Toolkit.mockImplementation(() => {
  return tools;
});
```

> Also, its for running actions code locally - I can run my code as a Node process without having to set all those env vars (which would be cumbersome as inline CLI arguments, or you'd need `dotenv`).

Interesting point. For what it's worth, when running locally I typically send in environment variables with `docker run -e`, i.e. in a simple `run.sh` I have:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
docker run \
  -e HOME=/root \
  -e GITHUB_WORKFLOW=main \
  -e GITHUB_ACTION=my-github-action \
  -e GITHUB_ACTOR=octocat \
  -e GITHUB_REPOSITORY=swinton/example \
  -e GITHUB_EVENT_NAME=issues \
  -e GITHUB_EVENT_PATH=/test/fixtures/issues.closed.json \
  -e GITHUB_WORKSPACE=/github/workspace \
  -e GITHUB_SHA=0000000 \
  -e GITHUB_REF=refs/heads/master \
  -e GITHUB_TOKEN=$GITHUB_TOKEN \
  my-github-action
```

I know there's also [`act`](https://github.com/nektos/act), I just haven't had a chance to use that yet.

> Definitely open to opinions here - I'm not 100% convinced either way honestly.

So, my _slight_ preference is to throw when the environment is not setup as expected, as it sends a clearer signal for what went wrong / what I likely overlooked in my implementation (_oops, I forgot to send in the environment variables, better whip up a script..._ kinda thing).

Currently I'm working around this with something like:

```javascript
const getTools = () => {
  const tools = new Toolkit();
  if (typeof tools.context.event === 'undefined') {
    throw new Error('GitHub Actions environment unavailable');
  }
  return tools;
};
```

But relying on`tools.context.event` being `undefined` feels a little brittle ü§î

+1 to this API. I feel like registering a command like this would be more explicit than a generic event emitter/subscription API (e.g. `toolkit.on('pizza')`).

To clarify https://github.com/JasonEtco/actions-toolkit/issues/17#issuecomment-458245263, are you stating that the only event a command can respond to is the `issue_comment` event and that the docs should explicitly state that?

Yeah, it'd be to avoid a ""gotcha"" where folks use the API in an action that cannot, by definition, trigger the command. I'd want to avoid people accidentally thinking that a `push` might trigger a `/command` üòÅ

Unfortunately not - the difficulty of testing Actions is one of the main reasons I wanted to write this library. [`create-an-issue`](https://github.com/JasonEtco/create-an-issue/blob/master/entrypoint.js) is a good example of a workaround - most of the functionality is outside of the main entrypoint (see `IssueCreator`), so its easier to write tests for the actual business logic.

Ok, so this is _expected_, but not _good_ - todo will ignore merge commits because the handling of merge-related things is typically done through PRs:

That said, I don't think that's the correct behavior. Ignoring merge commits _from a PR_ is correct, but merge commits outside of a PR should be treating like a regular commit. If you're interested in contributing, that'd look something like:

```js
  const commit = await context.github.git.getCommit(context.repo({commit_sha: context.payload.head_commit.id}))
  const isMergeCommit = commit.data.parents.length > 1
  if (isMergeCommit) {
    // Figure out if the commit is part of a pull request
    const isFromPr = true
    if (isFromPr) return
  }

To fix this annoyance, I had done a PR that used a simple heuristic to join all lines that were not separated by an empty lines. This works okay for normal text, but will break badly for code blocks - see [here](https://github.com/sunriseos/SunriseOS/issues/481#issue-495183124).

To fix that, this PR uses showdown, which can turn markdown to html and back. The interesting thing is that the markdown returned from doing this has all paragraphs on a single line with no line breaks inserted, which is exactly what we want to send to the github comment!

The comment in the issue you linked should definitely be rendered differently, with the code block. I'm not sure that converting it to HTML then to Markdown is the only way to go though; TODO should simply be the messenger, and not alter the contents of a comment if possible. Instead, I'd investigate why those individual `// BODY` lines are being concatenated into one line in the first place.

In [this GraphQL query](https://developer.github.com/v4/explorer/?query={%0A%20%20repository(owner%3A%20%22sunriseos%22%2C%20name%3A%20%22SunriseOS%22)%20{%0A%20%20%20%20issue(number%3A%20481)%20{%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20body%0A%20%20%20%20}%0A%20%20}%0A}%0A), you can see that the space between the code block and the text above it only has one newline character; I believe that that's the issue we should be solving.

So in cases like this, it's looking for `ANYTHING <KEYWORD> <TITLE>`, where `TITLE` is a wildcard match.

I'd recommend using multiline comments:

```html
<!--
  @todo foobar
-->

Thinking better... should not `@todo` be set to default instead of using an aggressive regex like `. *` To predict usage?

Any tag different of `TODO` and `@todo` need configured. So, why implement regex `.*` to prevent this occurrences?

We're discussing a bot issue. I do not think it's a better way to ""change the settings"". But we try to find a regex that predicts these cases too.

This one I have a quick answer to: I don't believe that this fits into todo. The goal of the app is to help people make notes for themselves quickly, in a long-term way, without losing context and getting distracted from their code. Introducing features that require thought, planning and (usually) switching over to GitHub to identify the name of the project/milestone, would hamper that experience. Plus, with workflow stuff like that, there's no end - and todo would become more and more complicated to use.

```
  if (search.data.total_count !== 0) {
    const existingIssue = search.data.items.find(issue => issue.title === title)

I was serious when I offered to help, I'm not in a rush to have this figured out so I'm all for pointing you in the right direction as your JS becomes less-rusty üòÅ 

You're definitely on the right track - `checkForDuplicateIssue` will return the existing issue that we care about:

https://github.com/JasonEtco/todo/blob/4f399561f4717bb87faab07a687c0ca64d8cd966/lib/utils/check-for-duplicate-issue.js#L17

It returning a string should be better commented - in one ""run"" of todo, as it parses a diff, it will keep track of repeat `TODO`s in an array. Upon seeing a repeated comment, `checkForDuplicateIssue` will return that soon-to-be-issue's title - telling the loop for creating issues not to create a duplicate. It's a bit of a mess of race conditions, but this ensures some reliability üòÖ 

We'll probably want to add functionality very similar to `reopenIfClosed` - after finding an existing issue, it says ""is it closed? Should we reopen it?"" - we'd want to now say ""let's edit it!""

https://github.com/JasonEtco/todo/blob/4f399561f4717bb87faab07a687c0ca64d8cd966/lib/push-handler.js#L37

Probably something along the lines of this, after where we declare the `body`:

```js
if (existingIssue && existingIssue.state === 'open') {
  return editIssue({ context, issue: existingIssue, body })
}
```

And `editIssue` will do something like:

```js
async function editIssue ({ context, issue, body }) {
  return context.github.issues.update(context.repo({ number: issue.number, body }))

I'm open to exploring this more to see if we can make it work though!

As for the latter - I'm really hesitant to add any special syntax. TODO operates on keywords, not any fancy AST parsing - this lets it be language agnostic. Adding syntax like `@[ ]` makes sense for parsing JSDoc comments, but won't have reliable equivalents in any other language or documentation tool.",NA,https://api.github.com/repos/JasonEtco/todo/issues/202/comments,https://github.com/JasonEtco/todo/issues/202#issuecomment-476070366,https://api.github.com/repos/JasonEtco/todo/issues/202

I do see what you mean - ```@body``` is only JSDoc and TODO supports other contexts as well. There is also the idea that task lists are part of the body of the issue.

Anyway, I can go ahead with the current functionality and I'm going to delete the comments once the task list is all checked off (which I think will close issues in a future release?), so it's not seriously problematic or anything. Maybe just more encouragement for your exploration of multi-line ```@body```s.",NA,https://api.github.com/repos/JasonEtco/todo/issues/202/comments,https://github.com/JasonEtco/todo/issues/202#issuecomment-476080786,https://api.github.com/repos/JasonEtco/todo/issues/202

This is what you would use now:

```js
/*

I'm thinking we bump the limit to `150000`, and see what happens.

For your information, its the size of the diff in its entirety - so for renamed files, that'd be the contents of the file twiceover, once as `- ...` under the previous name and once as `+ ...` under the new name. This system definitely conflicts with TODO's opinion of a ""large"" diff, but it shouldn't be acting on renamed files anyway.

Frankly, there's not a lot that can be done here without targeting these cases very specifically.

todo parses the diff as a string, not as a language AST - this is to be language agnostic. That means that it has no concept of comments: where they start _or end_. So, we can certainly say ""if the title ends with `*/`, remove it"" - but that may break other use cases where that's intentional and used in a different language.

Your implementation was spot on, and I really appreciate that you added some tests!

The one failing test was because the body keyword was also found in the body itself; this was throwing off the RegEx after the `(?<body>)` group became optional. I'll tackle that edge-case in a followup PR, so for now I just modified the test.

I also made some tweaks to the RegEx - thanks for flagging the performance concern. `.*` is basically `.+?`, since it matches ""0 or more of anything"" so that's a little win. I also moved some `?` around to be a little cleaner.

Lastly, I tweaked the for loop to use a `for...of` and eventually `.join()`, adding in `\n` or spaces where necessary. It might not be as performant, but its a lot easier to reason about when looking at the code. Eventually this might be better off as a concatenating string, but because of the index looking on line 16 its useful to be an array.

If those changes sound good to you I'll deploy this so we can try it out for real üéâ ",NA,https://api.github.com/repos/JasonEtco/todo/issues/178/comments,https://github.com/JasonEtco/todo/pull/178#issuecomment-444626393,https://api.github.com/repos/JasonEtco/todo/issues/178

I'd be open adding support for multiple continuous lines that match the body keyword, but a couple of questions first (not saying you need to answer them, just that we need to ask 'em):

* How will we concatenate the lines? Do we keep line breaks consistent with how it is in the code, or `.join(' ')`?
* Do we require that continuous lines match the _exact_ same body keyword, or do they only need to match the RegEx (which might include multiple keywords, or be case-insensitive)?

I like what the normal markdown (not GFM) does, which is to join with a space for single linebreaks, and with a \n for double linebreaks. This makes it easy to read both the source file and the resulting document, at the cost of a bit more complicated ""rendering"" logic. E.G.

```
this is a
test
```

results in ""this is a test"", but

```
this is a

test
```

results in ""this is a\ntest"".

-----------

As for your second question: I think whichever is easier on the implementation works :P. I think it'd be easier to just require each line to match the RegEx. Then we can just keep running the Regex on all lines until it stops matching.

```
BODY: Test
BODY:
BODY: Another test

This currently does not get matched, as the BODY *requires* spaces after the `:` to get matched. I thought I'd change the regex to make the whole right side of the `:` optional:

`.+(?<keyword>PIZZA|text):?(?:\s(?<body>.*))?`

This turns out to break one of the tests, namely ""text This is a text"". Example: https://regex101.com/r/A1FCUV/1

What I gather is this: 
The PR handler is run when a PR is opened or closed.
There can't be duplicate comments in either of those cases.
So what is the point of checking for duplicate comments.
I realise that the addition of the duplicate comment checking code to push-handler won't solve the problem. What needs to be done I reckon is to listen for push events on PR's and then run the duplicate comment checking code.",NA,https://api.github.com/repos/JasonEtco/todo/issues/160/comments,https://github.com/JasonEtco/todo/pull/160#issuecomment-427435569,https://api.github.com/repos/JasonEtco/todo/issues/160

<strong>v7.0.0</strong>

<h3>Improvements</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Probot has been rewritten in <a href=""/probot/probot/blob/v7.0.0/typescriptlang.org"">TypeScript</a>. Overall, you should see no significant difference between 6.2.0 and 7.0.0 and you can continue writing your apps in plain ol' JavaScript if you'd like. Writing Probot apps in TypeScript is still experimental, but if you'd like to help us improve the experience, please check out <a class=""issue-link js-issue-link"" data-error-text=""Failed to load issue title"" data-id=""316628963"" data-permission-text=""Issue title is private"" data-url=""https://github.com/probot/probot/issues/512"" href=""https://urls.greenkeeper.io/probot/probot/issues/512"">#512</a> and open pull requests to improve TypeScript support.</p>

<p>A lot of documentation improvements, including docs on <a href=""https://probot.github.io/docs/configuration/"" rel=""nofollow"">Environment Configuration</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fixes</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fix path to GraphQL API when using GitHub Enterprise.

For example, if a commit modifies two files, that commit will still only have one diff - `chunkDiff` ""chunks"" the diff into pieces that are easier to parse as separate files, which is important when putting together the new issue body that contains a filename and code blob. That said, there is still a match loop within the string that `chunkDiff` returns:

Yep thats right, each chunk represents one file. Note that this is not the same as Git's [hunk](https://www.bignerdranch.com/blog/using-git-hunks/) paradigm, which is separated by the `@@...@@` lines.

> Currently the regex in push_handler matches like this

Because the RegEx has the `g` global flag, it should be able to run repeatedly in a while loop until the `regex.exec(string)` returns `null`. `parseChunk` is called within that while loop, so it _should_ be run every time theres a match. I'll look into why it isn't doing that.",NA,https://api.github.com/repos/JasonEtco/todo/issues/136/comments,https://github.com/JasonEtco/todo/issues/136#issuecomment-378665075,https://api.github.com/repos/JasonEtco/todo/issues/136

I have been noticing some inconsistencies that users have been facing, but I haven't had time to look into it or respond to those issues. You've clearly spend some time digging into it, and that's awesome.

As you know, the difference between the two RegEx's you've linked to removes the `$` character, which matches until the end of a line (in multiline mode). It appears that some diffs' contents can actually start on the same line as the `@@...@@` line, which contains line numbers and diff metrics. That explains the inconsistency, since it doesn't always happen, but when it does it totally cancels out the match.

You did nothing wrong - this is a bug in TODO that I've seen before, but haven't had time to solve (and kept forgetting to open an issue for).

TLDR, it occurs when there are two hunks in the same file in a diff. That looks like:

```
diff --git a/README.md b/README.md
index 8f65799..f4be99b 100644
--- a/README.md
+++ b/README.md
@@ ... line numbers ... @@
+ changes
- other changes
@@ ... other line numbers ... @@
+ changes
- other changes
```

I believe that right now its basing the line numbers on the _first_ hunk, rather than the _nearest_ (most relevant) hunk numbers.

@JasonEtco 

Awesome! This issue was originally going to be a PR but I wasn't sure where all the pieces that I needed to do this where or if this was even possible from reading the code. Mind if I drop some lines of code in here and you can tell me if I'm right or wrong?

(*assumes answer is yes*)

Cool!

---

One thing I could not wrap my head around was this regex:

https://github.com/JasonEtco/todo/blob/f7914a00ff5146dbc93738612fbbf9f558fb7086/src/utils/chunk-diff.js#L18

Could you give me the what-what on this? From context it seems like this is the place where we find `TODO` comments that have been added and we return those diffs?

---

Here's another regex that I think is responsible for finding all the added (`+`) `TODO` items.

https://github.com/JasonEtco/todo/blob/f7914a00ff5146dbc93738612fbbf9f558fb7086/src/utils/parse-chunk.js#L24

The rest of the file parses the code around it to gather up info to post as a issue?

---

So I think I mostly need to change these files and change the regex to find removed lines as well, mark those somehow as being removed and then when detecting duplicates I can close those if there is a duplicate?
",NA,https://api.github.com/repos/JasonEtco/todo/issues/129/comments,https://github.com/JasonEtco/todo/issues/129#issuecomment-374015857,https://api.github.com/repos/JasonEtco/todo/issues/129
JasonEtco,todo,306145877,https://api.github.com/repos/JasonEtco/todo/issues/comments/374022962,374022962,MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NDAyMjk2Mg==,10660468,2018-03-18T17:53:34Z,2018-11-19T16:17:14Z,OWNER,"What do you mean @koddsson, those RegExes are all so clear and understandable `/sarcasm`!

The first one, in `chunk-diff.js`, takes a whole diff and returns an array of chunks. So for example, given this:

```diff
diff --git a/bin/todo.js b/bin/todo.js
index bc649d0..666960b 100755
--- a/bin/todo.js

+const octokit = require('@octokit/rest')()
diff --git a/package.json b/package.json
index 8b30cb6..8768e00 100644
--- a/package.json

   },
   ""dependencies"": {

     ""chalk"": ""^2.3.1"",
     ""commander"": ""^2.14.1"",
-    ""github"": ""^14.0.0"",
```

It'd split it into two chunks, one for changes to `bin/todo.js` and one for changes to `package.json`. This is mostly for ease-of-handling, and to have more determinable file names and line numbers.

---

That second RegEx parses a match, so when the overarching RegEx finds a TODO in a chunk in a diff, it'll send that chunk over to `parse-chunk.js`. You'll notice at the top I define variables from the capture groups:

https://github.com/JasonEtco/todo/blob/f7914a00ff5146dbc93738612fbbf9f558fb7086/src/utils/parse-chunk.js#L10-L18

Those come from this RegEx that actually parses the chunks and captures the right stuff:
https://github.com/JasonEtco/todo/blob/f7914a00ff5146dbc93738612fbbf9f558fb7086/src/utils/handler-setup.js#L14

Somewhere in there is `^(\\+)` - that's capturing the prefix (and there's even a variable for it in `chunk-diff.js`!). I was originally planning to treat removals differently, so at one point that was actually `^([-+])`, allowing for either prefix. That's where I'd start identifying the different lines.

Happy to talk through more of this, it gets a little messy with all the RegEx, but I think that with the variable `prefix` it's already a good ways into knowing when a TODO is removed - just need to do something with that information üôå ",NA,https://api.github.com/repos/JasonEtco/todo/issues/129/comments,https://github.com/JasonEtco/todo/issues/129#issuecomment-374022962,https://api.github.com/repos/JasonEtco/todo/issues/129

<summary>Release Notes</summary>
<strong>v6.1.0 ‚Äì 2018-03-21</strong>

<h2>Enhancements</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Do you love Probot and GraphQL? Well good news for you! Now you can use them together! Be warned: this is experimental. See the <a href=""https://probot.github.io/docs/github-api/#graphql-api"" rel=""nofollow"">docs to get started</a> and <a href=""https://urls.greenkeeper.io/probot/probot/issues/476"">share your feedback</a>. (<a class=""issue-link js-issue-link"" data-error-text=""Failed to load issue title"" data-id=""306308172"" data-permission-text=""Issue title is private"" data-url=""https://github.com/probot/probot/issues/472"" href=""https://urls.greenkeeper.io/probot/probot/pull/472"">#472</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An error will now be raised if there are several <code>.pem</code> files in your app directory. Set <code>PRIVATE_KEY_PATH</code> to specify which one you want to use. (<a class=""issue-link js-issue-link"" data-error-text=""Failed to load issue title"" data-id=""299718464"" data-permission-text=""Issue title is private"" data-url=""https://github.com/probot/probot/issues/441"" href=""https://urls.greenkeeper.io/probot/probot/pull/441"">#441</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Updated Node.js minimum version required to 8.3.0. This was a requirement for apps to run before, but the check was only looking for 7.7. (<a class=""issue-link js-issue-link"" data-error-text=""Failed to load issue title"" data-id=""305585249"" data-permission-text=""Issue title is private"" data-url=""https://github.com/probot/probot/issues/464"" href=""https://urls.greenkeeper.io/probot/probot/pull/464"">#464</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Switched from <a href=""https://www.npmjs.com/package/github-webhook-handler"" rel=""nofollow"">github-webhook-handler</a> to <a href=""https://urls.greenkeeper.io/octokit/webhooks.js"">@octokit/webhooks</a>. You shouldn't notice any changes, but let us know if your app has any weird symptoms (<a class=""issue-link js-issue-link"" data-error-text=""Failed to load issue title"" data-id=""305416863"" data-permission-text=""Issue title is private"" data-url=""https://github.com/probot/probot/issues/462"" href=""https://urls.greenkeeper.io/probot/probot/pull/462"">#462</a>)</p>

In YAML, multi-line comments must be prefixed with a `>` character and go until the next property; what do you think about going to the next empty new line? So:

```js
// BODY > This
// is
// a
// comment

// and this isn't part of it because of the empty line ^
```

This means that there won't be a max number of lines (although there probably should be, just in case), and it leaves it a little more open. The drawback is that some folks won't want an empty line right after their comment. What do you think?",NA,https://api.github.com/repos/JasonEtco/todo/issues/93/comments,https://github.com/JasonEtco/todo/issues/93#issuecomment-367708455,https://api.github.com/repos/JasonEtco/todo/issues/93

Totally! That'd have to be something pretty obvious, but still small enough to not be annoying to look at in the code. It'd also need to ignore the entire line that that end character(s) is on, otherwise it'd also consider things like comment delimiters as part of the body.

There is another significant problem though; different languages have different comment syntax, and we don't want that to come into the body. For example:

```js
// BODY > Here
// and here
```

The body should be:

```
Here
and here
```

But unless there's some real smart comment syntax detection, it'd render as:

```
Here
// and here
```",NA,https://api.github.com/repos/JasonEtco/todo/issues/93/comments,https://github.com/JasonEtco/todo/issues/93#issuecomment-367718196,https://api.github.com/repos/JasonEtco/todo/issues/93

Here
// and here

Fixing this would require us to write code specific to different languages and I dont think that is feasible.
Consider this. The user writes the comment in a single line. And whenever he/she wants a new line they insert a token like ```<br>``` or somethine along the same lines.
Eg.
```
// BODY : Here <br> Here.

Is their anyway to trigger todo to rescan the repository for the issue flags? Also, if I add a issue flag, like:
```
<!--
@todo Create Issue
@body Body

It scans the commits made in a push. It reads the files changed or added in those commits, parses out the issues to generate, checks if they already exist (to prevent duplicates), then generates them. It works pretty similarly in a PR, but it makes comments instead of issues.

So to answer your two questions:

1. To trigger **todo**, just push changes to the files you want it to scan.
1. It will not create a new issue if the same one (based on the issue title and the file its in) already exists. If one does exist and is closed, it'll be reopened.

The duplicate issues shouldn't be a problem, I very recently made a change in how it detects existing issues of the same name. Now it stores metadata in the issue body and checks that rather than just the title. However, that change meant that it would dupe issues that did not have that metadata, ie whatever was there in the couple hours before the change was made.

There is a known issue with blobs where if the file is, for example, 10 lines long and the issue title is on the last line, it gets confused since there is no line 15 (the issue title plus the configed blobLines number). This is kind of a combination between a problem with **todo** and with GitHub, but it should be fixable here.
