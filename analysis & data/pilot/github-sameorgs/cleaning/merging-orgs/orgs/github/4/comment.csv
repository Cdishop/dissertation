You can switch from the cdn in a few straightforward steps.
1. Download jquery to `haste-server/static/`
2. Edit `static/index.html` so that it points at your local jquery rather than google.
3. Restart haste-server.

Using a cdn here is helpful to prevent duplication of code and to reduce the small amount of bandwidth serving assets when self hosting. 

All the best, 
Bryce

This makes every data type in the config and storage objects a string because it carries over the string type from process.env attributes.

I've been running this site for a very long time completely by myself as a service to the community (with no ads mind you, look at other pastebin softwares for comparison).

I definitely care or I wouldn't have made this site, and continued to pour my own money in every month to keep it running for people I don't know.

I'll keep doing my best working to keep downtimes like this from happening, and if a 6-hour turnaround in the middle of the night (ET, while I'm sleeping) is this unacceptable you may want to choose another service to fit your needs (or run it yourself, the software is open source as well).",NA,https://api.github.com/repos/seejohnrun/haste-server/issues/261/comments,https://github.com/seejohnrun/haste-server/issues/261#issuecomment-431343499,https://api.github.com/repos/seejohnrun/haste-server/issues/261

I don't believe anywhere in the documentation it states 30 minutes. That sounds similar to the number in the config mentioned in the `about.md` on https://hastebin.com which is a different number than this one:

* `staticMaxAge` is the cache control value for static assets (ie: `about.md`) for browser caching (see https://www.keycdn.com/blog/http-cache-headers/)

Would love to be able to set an expiration, whether it's at least max exp. on server side or perhaps even let have a shorter expiration on the client side. (my storage is limited)

For example - PrivateBin has a dropdown menu like this. Not saying that Hastebin should let client be able to set shorter expiration than the max, just throwing it out there as an idea. The clutter this adds to the otherwise very clean interface may not be worth it.

Got pinged from the other thread, figured I'd try to help out here
Not too familiar with the structure of this project but I had a look at `application.js` and everything there looked fine. I debugged the `hljs` function that gets called with the `cs` language and found a masked exception:

    Error: Illegal lexeme ""<"" for mode ""<unnamed>""

Turns out the version of `hljs` this project depends on doesn't like classes that extend from generic parents. Specifically if I change `Comparer<Fraction>` on line 46 to `Comparer` everything seems to highlight just fine! Check it out: https://hastebin.com/gazufepaso.cs

I also checked out the `hljs` repo and looks like there's already an issue open there for this problem, go +1 it https://github.com/isagalaev/highlight.js/issues/1424

This can be fixed by removing the `display: inline-block` definition. [Not `vertical-align: top` because that would still misaling any leading spaces after the newlines!]

For some reason there is also a `line-height: 1em` override, which causes multi-line comments to offset the line numbering because a line in the comment span has a lower height than a normal line in the code block.

I personally see sense in SSL when login, when typing personal or sending any confidential and private info (Or just keep security of private self-codes web chat, etc.), and it is not needed if using it on news, information sites (just to read, with no input from visitor, maybe search or something).

I could improve the behaviour with the above change but it is still slightly misaligned for many block-commented lines and I'm not even sure if all browsers render that in the same way.

Indeed, levels are messed up in winston config files, and it's not fixed yet in my version. Unfortunately, re-ordering said levels manually (so the ""debug"" level will be lowest priority, zero) didn't help me. 

I found a workaround with _forever_, which allows console logs to be piped directly into a file (and in a handy plaintext format). It's also a nice wrapper for launching multiple node instances.
Now I launch haste-server like this:

<pre>
forever -a -l /var/log/haste.log
</pre>

My config.js for haste-server looks like this now:

<pre>
  ""logging"": [                                                                            
    {                                                                                     
      ""type"": ""Console"",
      ""level"": ""debug"",
      ""timestamp"": true
    }                                                                                     
  ],
</pre>

This solution is adding another layer of complexity (forever), but at least it does the job.

But It would be pretty cool to have an option to register as user, just to have a CRUD of pastes and being able to set a larger lifespan to use it in sites like stackoverflow, or any issue tracker platform.

I know that part of the beauty of this service it's its simplicity, maybe adding that layer it's too much against the grain of the project, but it could give it a wider range of uses.

sorry for the delay here - been crazy busy lately
indeed it's for minimizing db usage (I pay for hastebin out of pocket), and also hastebin was designed more for disposable hastes (although you can definitely set it up to work differently yourself using one of the db adapters and corresponding settings)

I'll see what I can do to increase the time a bit @FichteFoll - just want to make sure I can keep the service fast, without ads, and not too expensive to run!

You can send the stdout of something to hastebin like this:

    somecommand | curl --data-binary@- https://hastebin.com/documents

That will return a JSON repsonse that looks something like:

    {""key"":""oxekofidik""}

And you can turn that into a URL by appending the value to `https://hastebin.com`.  That is, the URL for this example would be <https://hastebin.com/oxekofidik>. This is an unfortunate api, because it makes hastebin difficult to use from the command line with some code to handle extracting the key from the response and generate a URL.

A simple shell script that handles this might look like:

```
#!/bin/bash

result=$(curl -sf --data-binary @${1:--} https://hastebin.com/documents) || {
	echo ""ERROR: failed to post document"" >&2
	exit 1
}

key=$(jq -r .key <<< $result)

echo ""https://hastebin.com/${key}""

```

Assuming the script is named `hastebin`, running it looks like:

```
$ echo look ma no hands | hastebin
https://hastebin.com/lubiveyuni

```
Or:

```
$ hastebin README.md 
https://hastebin.com/carateheki

```

---

It would be useful if hastebin were to implement support for the http `PUT` method at this endpoint, and then return a URL.  This would allow convenient use of curl's `-T` command line option without any additional wrapper.  Posting a file would look like:

    curl -Tmyfile https://hastebin.com/documents

And posting stdin would look like:

    curl -T- https://hastebin.com/documents

It would also make sense to implement the api on `/` instead of `/documents`, because this would reduce the amount of typing by 25%.  Support posting over plain `http://` and you could just write:

    curl -T- hastebin.com

Which would be awesome, and is short enough that it doesn't really make sense to write a dedicated client anymore.  In fact, [chunk.io](http://chunk.io) does exactly this, and it is super convenient.",NA,https://api.github.com/repos/seejohnrun/haste-server/issues/54/comments,https://github.com/seejohnrun/haste-server/issues/54#issuecomment-282489506,https://api.github.com/repos/seejohnrun/haste-server/issues/54

I'm having trouble getting this feature to work with my JavaScript ""client."" When I try to submit data via JSONP, I get back the HTML for Hastebin rather than JSON containing a key.

As a test, I tried a submitting form to my local instance of Hastebin normally, with no JavaScript. When I used POST to send the data, I received a key as expected. When I used GET to send the data, my browser navigated to http://0.0.0.0:7777/documents/?data=jhklhkljh, which gave me the HTML for Hastebin.

So, it sounds like I'd need to use POST instead of GET. The problem is that JSONP works only with GET, not POST. Additionally, GET is probably not well-suited for submitting large blocks of code.

Any thoughts on what might be going on here? Am I misunderstanding how to interact with haste-server? Should I be using CORS instead of JSONP? If it helps, you can see my extremely basic ""client"" code at https://github.com/rdebeasi/post-haste.

Thanks again for your help, and my apologies if the JSONP suggestion turns out to be a bad idea.

The branch will allow retrieval of haste data for a given key via JSONP

I'm a bit wary to take in data for hastes over GET.

Maybe it's an idea to offer a library you can use on your site - which is hosted on the hastebin domain to create documents (similar to the approach taken with stripe.js) which would allow for CORS

Do you have some more details on your use case?  There's always the ability have a smaller server that created the pastes but that may be too heavyweight

I patched it but the patch didn't go down the way it should.

On the client side the subdirectory becomes part of the key that is used to handle the file. So instead of ""$key"" you get something like ""subdirectory/$key"" which is kinda annoying and can only be fixed by changing the routes in the main server. They have to be change anyway to support ""$subdir/$key"" but in the end they need to support ""$subdir/$subdir/$key"" because of the mess that happens on the client side.

It's also a problem to get the new subfolder to the client part without patching stuff. I had to patch the application.js file to make the requests go to the right place.

So far it doesn't seem easy to just add a root_path variable.

Any hints or tips that could help me to implement it and I'm offering the patch :)

Essentially to do this correctly we'd need to group all of the dates by their time zones if I'm reading things correctly in order to fill out `extdparam` according to https://www.kanzaki.com/docs/ical/exdate.html

In that case, we'd still end up with multiple `EXDATE` entries, so I'm torn on the value here.

If I've interpreted this snippet correctly:
> The ""DTSTART"" property defines the first instance in the recurrence set.  The ""DTSTART"" property value SHOULD match the pattern of the recurrence rule, if specified.  The recurrence set generated with a ""DTSTART"" property value that doesn't match the pattern of the rule is undefined.  The final recurrence set is generated by gathering all of the start DATE-TIME values generated by any of the specified ""RRULE"" and ""RDATE"" properties, and then excluding any start DATE-TIME values specified by ""EXDATE"" properties.

It sounds like there should be alignment between the type of value for DTSTART, the values generated by RRULE, and the values listed in EXDATE. Which might suggest that EXDATE values should share the same time zone as DTSTART (be it UTC, local/floating, or specified with a TZID).

However, looking closely at the wording used in the last sentence of that excerpt:
> and then excluding any start DATE-TIME values specified by ""EXDATE"" **_properties_**

I can confirm downgrading to `0.16.2` resolves this specific issue. It definitely seems to be related to DST.

Please find 2 examples below that replicate the issue.

## First example
In our case, we have a daily task to be executed at 8am. If the schedule is created to start on `2019-03-31`, no occurrence is created for the 31st.

```ruby
Time.zone = ""Copenhagen""

starts_at = Time.zone.parse(""2019-03-31 00:00:00 CET"")
schedule = IceCube::Schedule.new(starts_at) do |s|
  s.add_recurrence_rule IceCube::Rule.daily.hour_of_day(8)
end

schedule.first(2)
# =>  [Mon, 01 Apr 2019 08:00:00 CEST +02:00, Tue, 02 Apr 2019 08:00:00 CEST +02:00]
```

I would expect the first element of the above array to be `Sun, 31 Mar 2019 08:00:00 CEST +02:00`, (`2019-03-31T08:00:00+02:00` in iso8601).

## Second example

Interestingly enough, if you start the schedule the day before, the desired occurrence on the 31st appears, i.e.

```ruby
starts_at = Time.zone.parse(""2019-03-30 00:00:00 CET"")

schedule = IceCube::Schedule.new(starts_at) do |s|
  s.add_recurrence_rule IceCube::Rule.daily.hour_of_day(8)
end

schedule.first(2)
# => [Sat, 30 Mar 2019 08:00:00 CET +01:00, Sun, 31 Mar 2019 08:00:00 CEST +02:00]

I think the relevant issue for that align method is #416, which was intended to minimize the possibility of creating invalid rule combinations with different frequencies/multiples.

I haven't had time to digest this yet, but is there a reason why that frequency check only applies to `hour_of_day` as you've done? Or could it be the same issue for other validations like `minute_of_hour` and `second_of_minute`, too?

I appreciate the help as I'm pretty new to the internals of this gem.

My understanding is that `hour_of_day` was running into issues due to referencing `base_interval_validation`.

Using the PR spec as an example, `base_interval_validation` is `#<IceCube::Validations::WeeklyInterval::Validation:0x007f8508307610 @interval=2, @week_start=:sunday>`

This causes [L28](https://github.com/seejohnrun/ice_cube/blob/master/lib/ice_cube/validations/hour_of_day.rb#L28) to subtract 2 (weeks) from 11 (hours) without their respective units.

The `minute_of_hour` and `second_of_minute` do not seem to reference `base_interval_validation` at all, instead using `validations[:minute_of_hour]` and `validations[:second_of_minute]`. I don't see opportunity for the same unit mismatching.


I share your concerns though as to whether this is a partial solution. I would have to research to see whether there could be a situation where `@validations[:interval]` could contain both weekly and hourly interval validations. We may still need to extract the hourly interval in this case. Additionally [here](https://github.com/seejohnrun/ice_cube/blob/master/lib/ice_cube/rules/weekly_rule.rb#L54) there is potential for interval unit mismatch (although I do not have context to know whether externalities already prevent this).",NA,https://api.github.com/repos/seejohnrun/ice_cube/issues/451/comments,https://github.com/seejohnrun/ice_cube/issues/451#issuecomment-434773534,https://api.github.com/repos/seejohnrun/ice_cube/issues/451

Can you say more about your ""128 checks""? Are you checking the same date against 128 different schedules, or 128 dates against the same schedule?

I'm not seeing the same performance that you reported. With the above benchmark running on ruby 2.5, and ActiveSupport 5.2, I'm seeing:

```
       user     system      total        real
   0.128318   0.009283   0.137601 (  0.145315)
```

A couple things to consider anyway:

First, if you can fast-forward your start date so there are fewer days in the past to consider, that should reduce the time linearly. I see you are evaluating over 3 years there, which is some 1100 days that it works through. You might be able to load your earliest `previous_occurrence` once, and then use that as your new start time for the following checks:

```
check_dates = [Date.new(2018, 6, 16), Date.new(2019, 7, 17)]
check_dates.sort.each do |date|
  result = schedule.previous_occurrence(date)
  schedule.start_time = result # fast-forward new start time for the next item
end
```

Second, `previous_occurrence` is much less performant because it needs to enumerate from the start time. The way IceCube works is by jumping forward the smallest interval from the schedule (daily in your example), and selecting matching occurrences. `next_occurrence` is just one jump forward. If you can use that, it's another possibility instead of advancing the schedule start time.

Finally, I'm not sure if your daily rule is an artificial example, but if your schedule is really just ""every day"" then you don't really need the complexity that IceCube provides, and you could just use much simpler `date - 1` arithmetic for your use case instead.",NA,https://api.github.com/repos/seejohnrun/ice_cube/issues/443/comments,https://github.com/seejohnrun/ice_cube/issues/443#issuecomment-409432636,https://api.github.com/repos/seejohnrun/ice_cube/issues/443

I think here because you are trying to jump from `00:00:00` to the previous occurrence at `23:59:59.99999`, it's jumping back to `23:59:59` which is before the range of the schedule.

For instance, on Ruby 2.4, this works:

```ruby
date = Date.current
loop do

I'm not familiar with iCal specifications, thanks for the references,
I'll check it out.

I'm using ice-cube for scheduling recurrent event in a project I'm
working on.

The original issue that got me into this was like this:
1. Create a schedule with recurrent rule (say daily)
2. Add a exception time
3. Update =schedule.start_time=
4. *The exception rule is no longer effective now* (Because it's a
SingleOccurrenceRule for a specific time and =schedule.start_time= was
changed)

The script to reproduce this:
```ruby
    schedule = IceCube::Schedule.new(Time.parse('12:00'))
    schedule.add_recurrence_rule(IceCube::Rule.daily)

    schedule.next_occurrence
    # => 2017-10-17 12:00:00 +0800

    schedule.add_exception_time(schedule.next_occurrence)
    # => 2017-10-17 12:00:00 +0800
    schedule.next_occurrence
    # => 2017-10-18 12:00:00 +0800

    schedule.start_time = Time.parse('13:00')
    # => 2017-10-17 13:00:00 +0800
    schedule.next_occurrence
    # => 2017-10-17 13:00:00 +0800
    # But I want the exception_rule to be synced with schedule.start_time
    # So the next_occurrence will be 2017-10-18 13:00:00 +0800
```

The solution I came up with was to get all exception time and update
their times one by one, which is not very efficient but we can take it
for now.

So for this solution, I tried to use @exception_rules@ to get all the
exception rules but it didn't work (since I was using
@add_exception_time@ to add rule)

(Maybe you can suggest some better solutions for my requirement?)

Then I submitted this issue and the PR.

I think the problem here is about naming, I thought:
1. @exception_rules@ was about getting all exception rules instead of
all except single times
2. @exception_times@ was using @exception_rules@ to get all rules and
convert them into times

And I double checked SingleOccurrenceRule, it inherits Rule but it
doesn't implement to_ical method, which is a bit odd to me.

Maybe we can come up with better names to distinguish these methods and
classes better? (Or is there any background I'm missing here?)

1. Use `add_exception_time` to exclude that specific Monday for this event

Your assessment looks correct. Is the `spans: true` option relevant to this? I could not see a difference in the output.

We did recently fix an issue with doubled occurrences over DST, and removed some complicated code that was handling it.

I'm not 100% sure about the `next_occurrence` implementation, but I understood that `spans: true` can be set if a ""overlapping"" occurrence is fine as well (i.e start_time is before - and end_time is after reference date) or if the next occurrence must start after given reference date (i.e. both start_time and end_time have to be after the reference date).

If that understanding is correct, `spans: true` would be required to return the expected occurrence from the example above (`2017-10-28 16:00:00 +0200 - 2017-10-29 09:00:00 +0100`). `spans: false` should return the current result of the example above (`2017-10-29 16:00:00 +0100 - 2017-10-30 09:00:00 +0100`).",NA,https://api.github.com/repos/seejohnrun/ice_cube/issues/414/comments,https://github.com/seejohnrun/ice_cube/issues/414#issuecomment-329779376,https://api.github.com/repos/seejohnrun/ice_cube/issues/414

Your example schedule has a duration of 17 hours: that means each occurrence must have the same length.

Because the end of DST adds one hour, that occurrence actually ends at 08:00, not at 09:00 like on other days, so the selection of the ""next occurrence"" is correct.

I considered whether the occurrence should have a different length in this situation, but based on [the spec][1], it should not. Internally, we specify the duration in seconds so it should always be an exact period. However, the spec _does_ allow for setting duration in different amounts, e.g. ""1D"" should mean a day, regardless of whether it is 24 or 25 hours... IceCube currently doesn't support this, but it could be added without changing the current meaning of duration.

You have set `hourly(3)` = every 3 hours, and `count(4)` = 4 times only. The 4 hourly occurrences are based on the start time, and then they stop: 

```

 2017-08-17 09:00:00 +0530,

Setting it with Date is ambiguous, and I believe incorrect that we allow it, so we should prevent bad input from failing silently like this. 

There are a few places where we allow Date input because we can use the schedule's context to convert it to the proper time zone. In the case of `Schedule.new(Time.zone.today)` and then `Rule.new(Date.today)`, these are independent inputs and the new rule doesn't know the schedule's time context for us to convert it.

For example in June - if you take the range from 27th to 30th, it ignores all the days (schedule.start_date = 25th of June), if I take occurrences for 25-30, it works well.
If I take 26-30, 27-30, 28-30, 29-30, 30-30, any of these, it gives me an empty array as a result.

for July - I took schedule.start_date = 26th. Now, for the range 26-31, it gives me the correct result, all days including 26th and 31st.
BUT, for the ranges 27-31, 28-31, 29-31 and 30-31, I always get the result of 30th and 31st days.

Then I checked for the beginning of the month. I couldn't find any bug whatsoever here.

This was removed purposefully because it was all too easy to serialize a schedule that excludes itself, and this would cause apps to go into an infinite loop at some unexpected time in the future when the schedule gets reloaded.

Can you work around this by defining your schedules differently?

It might be possible for us to keep it in `to_hash` and only remove it when going `to_json` and `to_yaml` with a warning.

It may be easier to set up a group of daily rules, each one with its own `hour_of_day` and `minute_of_hour` instead. For 75 minutes, you could do it with a maximum of four rules:

If the database is storing NULL (an _absence_ of a specified value, not a _default_ or _new_ value) I don't see why we would _want_ to assume anything from it: in this case the record object should not have any schedule until one is explicitly assigned.

Is this causing errors with ActiveRecord? We may have to return something different for handling the null object specially then.

As a side note, I see the docs also mention:

> Empty objects as `{}`, in the case of `Hash`, or `[]`, in the case of `Array`, will always be persisted as null.

So what this implies is that Rails expects nullable columns in the database, but requires their values to somehow still be specified in ActiveRecord!?

You could make that a dependency of IceCube and use it for parsing dates using whatever timezone is passed in TZID. It doesn't look like it depends on ActiveSupport. Maybe use ActiveSupport by default and use the gem above as a fallback?

We can modify the time zone parser to use `Time.use_zone` instead:

``` ruby
def self._parse_in_tzid(value, tzid)
  time_zone = tzid ? tzid.split('=')[1] : Time.zone
  Time.use_zone time_zone do
    Time.zone.parse(value)

This will switch `Time` to use the time zone of whatever was specified in the TZID of the iCalendar event, falling back to whatever the system / server is configured to be by default. I believe this produces identical results to using your previous:

``` ruby
ActiveSupport::TimeZone.new(time_zone).parse(value)

Unless I'm forgetting something, you don't interact with the parser directly, you call e.g. `IceCube::Schedule.from_ical(ical_string)` to parse the ical string. It seems inconvenient to have a hidden dependency (which is not a gem-level dependency) on ActiveRecord for anyone using the `from_*` methods, because it seems like the majority of people using this library will be serializing & deserializing at some point and so will need to have ActiveRecord.

@dcosson What I think @seejohnrun meant when he said ""How about when they want the parser having them require in that separately"" was that people who need the functionality that depends on ActiveSupport could require that gem themselves (e.g. add it to their bundle) in order to disable the exception you proposed, and enable the functionality.

If you want to specify a fixed time offset without daylight savings time then you can specify the offset for your start time: `Time.new(2016, 3, 13, 0, 0, 0, ""-05:00"")` and your times will always be -05:00 from UTC year-round. This might not match with your expected actual local time though.

Closing this. If we can show this is a real issue, I'm happy to reopen it.

- Rails ActiveSupport defines `1.month == 30.days`, except when you add it to a time
- IceCube schedules can have only one duration for all occurrences

If you try `time + 1.month`, you will see how ActiveSupport does arithmetic: it does some special handling to add the correct number of days based on the current month (30, 31, 28, or 29 days).

However, this is not reliable for exporting to iCal or serializing to hash / YAML format, so we use the strict single duration for the whole schedule.

If your occurrences always run for 1 month, you can work around this by not relying on the duration at all, and just compare the year and month yourself to see if it's ""occurring"" in the time window.

I'm sorry I can't see a good way to fix this right now, but different durations for occurrences do come up frequently, so we might look into that in the future. It looks like multiple values should be supported as shown in [the spec](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5545#section-3.3.6), but it also says it doesn't support ""M"" for month durations either...

You can set an exception time (`add_exception_time` / `extime`) for your schedule, but there is no way to replace it with an occurrence of a different length. (Duration is global to the whole schedule.)

These occurrences still have the same duration, so they are technically valid. I don't think raising an exception applies.

What we could add is a method that tells you if the occurrence is affected by DST change. Something like this?

```
occurrence.dst_change?  #=> true
occurrence.dst_change  #=> 0 or -3600.0 or 3600.0
```

Depending on your circumstance you could subtract that from the end time. Would that work?

It also allows for some ""extensions"" on parsing iCal lines, including (a) blank lines, and (b) comment lines starting with ""#"", and (c) if a line looks like a date ""yyyymmdd"", treat it as an RDATE automatically.

These extensions are all disabled by default, but can be enabled with `IceCube::IcalParser.use_extensions = true`, or setting env var `ICE_CUBE_ICAL_EXTS` to non-empty.

I know this is a lot, but if you are interested in merging, I will be happy to add rspecs for all of this. I just needed it for work and figured it would be good to share.  Cheers.

Note the hour on these starts out different because of how they were defined. ""05:15 +0000"" is offset differently from EST depending on the time of year.

@jacaetevha trying the same thing in plain ruby will get you different results. DST only works with your `ENV['TZ']`, where you can use `Time.local`. If you build a time with a manual offset (or different TZ) then it will stay fixed and not change with DST.

- If the user is available
- And if the schedule `occurs_at` at current time
- Run the processing

There is also another rub: I run my scheduler every ten minutes or so to pick up jobs that are due. I have to account for the scheduler not running exactly at 9am -- it might run at 9.01am. Typically, setting a duration helps, or here, since you have a window, the scheduler is likely to run at least once in the window of availability. 

I could have had exceptions per user, but since a task typically is assigned to a group, I decided to add a little logic just to police the per user availability. (I actually have lots of other rules, too, such as expiries , whether that are recurrence rules for a task, etc.)

So, I guess what I'm saying is, you could create a schedule of availability per user, and then a schedule for your tasks, and both have to agree it is time to actually run something.

Schedules are already serialized with the time zone preserved when you create your schedule using a time zone. It stores the UTC timestamp, plus the original time zone annotation.

This would lose the original time zone context when serializing the schedule:

```
def self.serialize_time(time)
  time.utc
end

Let's say the user creates the event when their time zone is EST and then later changes their time zone to PST.

Since the time zone is serialized into the schedule, I would have to go and update every schedule when the user changes their time zone.

I don't see how the ""native hash serializer"" is related to this though, I'm assuming you mean postgres Hstore? (Just to be sure we're on the same page, `#to_hash` is not the same thing as `#hash`.)

YAML is used because we need to include time zone, not just a fixed offset. Note how ""PST"" gets lost, at least when converting to JSON:

```
Time.zone = 'America/Vancouver'
#=> ""America/Vancouver""
Time.zone.now
#=> Fri, 20 Feb 2015 11:53:07 PST -08:00

You _could_ set fixed exception times within the schedule,

The downside is that it's specific to exactly that schedule, so it has to match the time for each occurrence exactly. If you move the schedule by an hour then those exception times won't line up anymore. Depending how you work with these schedules, this approach might work for you. 

However, it might be better to store & handle those time ranges separately from the schedule itself, which would be more flexible since I assume you'll want to ""manage"" vacations anyway...

I can see your argument though, the start time of November 3 has missed the day-of-month that should have been the first occurrence (November 1), so you might expect it to find the _actual_ first occurrence to happen in December.

Why not set the start time to the correct position you expect? You can also set the start time to the correct day (01), and then you don't need the day-of-month validation.

I see you can read the rule in two different ways and I couldn't say my interpretation is any more valid.

In our application we have some rules that enforce when time periods can start, sort of like _setup time_. If `today` was **January the 1st**, and there is **2 days** of _setup time_, the earliest date we can allow would be the **3rd**. We wanted to be able to say something like `every two months, on the 1st of the month, from the 3rd of January`. As is, `IceCube` wouldn't do what we'd expect in giving us the **1st of Feb**, instead it would be the **1st of March**, skipping our intended month.

To get around this, we currently calculate `IceCube`'s `start_time` by setting `interval` to `1` and getting the `next_occurrence` in the schedule. Is there an alternative approach you could suggest?

I can understand if you want to keep the current behaviour, but I thought you may find it useful to hear our use case :)

I can't see if this ambiguity between DTSTART, BYMONTHDAY, and INTERVAL is resolved there, but there is some logical order for how these rules are applied.

I also like to test some other tool like Apple's Calendar app to validate any assumptions. I just tried adding an event starting Nov 3, with a ""custom"" schedule of every 2 months, occurring on the 1st of the month. The first occurrence disappeared from Nov 3 (since it's not valid as ""1st of the month""), and reappeared on January 1st. This matches what IceCube does.

It sounds like you're doing it right by resetting the start time to the first valid occurrence before increasing the interval, if that's what you expect in your case.

It is only happening for schedules with @until set which gets set for some Appointments in my app using the following code:

    cancel_date = self.date

    schedule.recurrence_rules[0].until(cancel_date.to_time)
    base_appointment.schedule = schedule
```

after that point, whenever an affected appointment's schedule is loaded in code via:

``` ruby
  schedule = appointment.schedule

the deprecation warning is triggered in the log.

NOTE: schedule is serialized in my Appointment model:

``` ruby

As you can see, the last occurrence crosses daylight savings time (so the offset changes from -07:00 to -08:00), and so just saving the offset alone is not going to work. This is why the time zone itself must be serialized.

Currently IceCube's own `to_yaml` is a bit different than your example above. We don't output the ruby/object annotation because the `from_yaml` method handles the deserialization, but I don't think it would hurt to add it either.

So it sounds like this will be fixed upstream in 4.2... Do you think this monkey patch should be handled by IceCube when ActiveSupport < 4.2 is loaded?

I was looking at the IceCube code for `to_yaml` and `from_yaml`, which appears to work with my example above. I can probably replace the monkey patch in my code with custom accessors that call those instead (or possibly just use https://github.com/avit/schedule_attributes with a patch to change the column name to match my database).

I'm still concerned with `DateTime` and `Time` objects, which don't have time zones associated with them. If they are serialized and deserialized on machines with different default time zones, it could cause the same problem. While that might seem like a rare case, it's a nasty bug when it bites you. It's probably not a good idea to require ActiveSupport, but it might be worth converting any DateTime or Time object to a TimeWithZone object when ActiveSupport is present. Not sure where the best place to do that would be - possibly in `TimeUtil.serialize_time`?

Adding the `ruby/object` annotation to our YAML output might break things if TimeWithZone doesn't support the zone correctly yet.

As for the core ruby classes, I think everything is working well as it stands. They work exactly as the core ruby classes work, so it's predictable based on how you initialize your schedule: you just have to be aware that they're not time-zone aware. (Time does support ""local"" based on `ENV['TZ']` or ""utc"", and these work fine if you only need to support a single time zone.)

I18n default time format is memoized here: https://github.com/seejohnrun/ice_cube/blob/master/lib/ice_cube.rb#L71, so when you run the whole suite it takes the value the first time (english format) and keeps on with that even if you change the `I18n.locale`. 

I'm not particularly happy to see such kind of class-level memoizing, I suspect that will cause thread-safety issues. I think that we should remove that, what do you think @avit?

This is not a TimeWithZone, it's a plain Time. You only know the offset (-07:00), but not the zone.

If I gave you the offset +01:00, there's no way to tell if it's Central Europe or Western Africa. The time would be wrong for half the year. (One follows Daylight Savings Time and the other doesn't.)

Also, the list of time zone abbreviations is inconsistent, so just adding ""PST"" as a suffix has its own share of problems. See the [wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_time_zone_abbreviations) for the number of different zones that are all named ""CST"" for example.

Hope that makes sense? I'm happy to answer any questions about it but I don't think we should change it.

I did have another look at this last weekend, but it needs some deeper debugging. I had to work backwards by altering your tests to bring the dates closer together from the start time to the problem time in order to narrow it down. (Surprisingly it's not Daylight Savings Time, for once...)

I have some ideas where to look next, I just need some time to dive into it.

In any case this error should not be handled in HashParser. (HashParser should never expect nil as a possible input.)

Two things to consider. Firstly, dumping:

```
IceCube::Schedule.dump(nil)
IceCube::Schedule.dump("""")
```

We should change this to not blindly convert `to_yaml` in these scenarios. This allowed your sample model to save with some empty YAML in the first place, which causes problems when reloading. Properly, only `Schedule` instances should be dumpable, not strings, but we should handle `nil` and `""""` as special cases. 

Secondly, loading:

```
IceCube::Schedule.load(""---\n...\n"")
```

I'm debating whether this should just return `nil` or raise an error, although a more helpful one than it currently does. I would actually prefer to see the error, since we should not be accepting arbitrary YAML that doesn't have a `:start_time` at least.

Loading `""""` and `nil` already returns nil. it's only the case of actual empty YAML that causes an error.

Fundamentally I think the problem you had was with the dumping, not the loading. Does this make sense?

Please follow up on the discussion there. I'm going to close this, but still open to input. 

Updating the `should_receive` mocks into `expect` is definitely a good idea since these are gone in RSpec 3. The regular `should` still exists, so I wonder if it's worth changing everything over to it... we don't have anything hacky in IceCube that causes problems with ""should"".

Maybe it will be worth the change, since more and more people ""expect"" the new syntax now.

The feature we are working on is a sort of 'retroactive' one. We use ice_cube to create a recurring email digest - but we were having trouble with the very first occurrence. Say you want an email digest every 5:00 am daily - we get all emails from the last run up to the next. There are 2 cases here:

if you set the rule AFTER the time, (say rule is 5:00AM daily and you set it at 7:00AM), you will get all messages from 5:00am this morning up to 5:00am tomorrow. If you set the rule BEFORE (rule is 5:00AM but you set it at 4:00AM), we were hoping to send all messages from 5:00AM yesterday to 5:00AM today. This is a simple case, but imagine if the rule was every 7,9th and 13th of the month etc.

My only concern is that `caller[0]` might be unhelpful. e.g. HashParser has deprecation messages under private methods; these get called internally from `to_schedule`, which gets called from `Schedule#from_hash`. We would only be showing the line number of the internal IceCube method call.

The depth inside the caller stack might vary: I think we should look for the first line of client code. I'm thinking maybe:

The problem is that when I ran into the less helpful messages I went into my app and found that I wasn't using any of the deprecated methods/properties, all of it was coming from the round trip to/from YAML.

In my opinion if a library deprecates any option/usage it should lead by example and not issue a release with any deprecation warnings coming from the internals. If this were the case here I likely would have found the first application frame in caller, but since all of the deprecations I am encountering are internal to the library I don't think it is very user friendly to make that change.

Reading [RFC2445](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2445) indeed `UNTIL=` accepts both `DATE` and `DATETIME`.

Looking into this in more detail, I'm getting the idea that this pull request doesn't actually supports timezones (e.g. `tzid` is parsed off, but not used in `schedule_from_ical`, and there is no check for a trailing `Z` and `Date.parse` doesn't seem to handle that either). Am I right?

Moving to [icalendar](https://github.com/icalendar/icalendar) can be useful, but that's probably a long stretch.

So I don't really see the point of doing the conversion halfway.  What do you get from that?

The 'x.should ==' pattern:
1. Requires all objects to be decorated such that they respond to 'should'
2. Requires the override of expected behavior for '==', which is a fundamental method

At heart, these two issues are what drove the RSpec 3.x syntax change.

Given there's question about doing the overall transition, I'd recommend pulling out the gemspec fix and RSpec version upgrade into a separate PR and leaving the transpec changes open for longer discussion.

``` ruby
# ...
describe ""next_occurrence"" do
  subject { schedule.next_occurrence }

  it { should be_a Time }
  its(:hour) { should == start_time.hour }

  context ""on a full moon"" do
    # setup using before / let
    it { should == x }
  end

```

This is the ExampleGroup version of should (https://github.com/yujinakayama/transpec#two-types-of-should) which is not going away. I'm not 100% either way, but between the ""new"" RSpec syntax vs. plain Minitest, I'm starting to lean away from RSpec. I don't expect this test suite will change any time soon, and we do have the rspec development gem locked for ""< 3.0"" anyway.

Maybe @seejohnrun has a preference to sway this either way.

Yes let's fix the gemspec for sure, I can just cherry-pick that from the other commit instead of bothering with another PR.

It does work, but I'm using the closing time too so I think the only option is to use a `take_while` like this:

```
schedule.remaining_occurrences_enumerator(opening_time).take_while { |o| o.start_time <= closing_time }

It would be easier/neater if the closing time could be passed directly to `remaining_occurrences_enumerator`:

```
# Returns an enumerator for all remaining occurrences
def remaining_occurrences_enumerator(from = nil, to = nil)
  from ||= TimeUtil.now(@start_time)
  enumerate_occurrences(from, to)

The issue stems from `full_required?` being `true` on rules that have intervals `>1` (as per https://github.com/seejohnrun/ice_cube/pull/92).  If you take this out, you will get the performance you'd expect back.

Now as to why that's an issue in general - when the interval is `>1` we walk from `start_time` instead of `opening_time`, thus going over a large time range just to determine if `opening_time` is in the proper interval from `start_time`.

Sidetiq will keep around the current `start_time`, which is set as a hard:

``` ruby
# from https://github.com/tobiassvn/sidetiq/blob/master/lib/sidetiq/schedule.rb
START_TIME = Sidetiq.config.utc ? Time.utc(2010, 1, 1) : Time.local(2010, 1, 1)
```

So I'm not sure which side of the usage is the problem - that we should be doing something to provide a `next_occurrence` version which can force `opening_time` instead of `start_time`, or that sidetiq should be setting `start_time` as the occurrence time of the last tick instead of January 1st, 2010.

> can rescheduling an occurrence to the following day be handled gracefully with a combination of #add_exception_time and adding a single extra occurrence?

Yes, I don't see why not, that's what exceptions are meant for. You can't change the interval ""tick"" when a scheduled event occurs, but you can mask it with an exception time and add another time in its place.

> are there prefabricated Schedules for like... major US holidays or something similar?

No, we don't have anything like that off the shelf. There is a ticket for supporting `#from_ical` that we expect to merge soon: this could allow you to import from other sources. However, there's no ""merge"" for schedules if you need to intersect them. At its simplest, this could be just an array of times that you manage yourself, something like this:

``` ruby
holidays.each do |t|
  case t.wday
  when 6 # Saturday, observed on Friday
    schedule.add_exception_time(t)
    schedule.add_recurrence_time(t - 1.day)
  when 7 # Sunday, observed on Monday
    schedule.add_exception_time(t)
    schedule.add_recurrence_time(t + 1.day)
  else
    schedule.add_recurrence_time(t)
  end
end
```

> And a long shot... any frontend (javascript/html) libraries that play nice with this gem, using a similar chaining format for specifying recurrence?

See the wiki! There's a list of related projects and an example model for serializing schedules.  :smile:

You can simply do this:

I think we should deprecate the options passed to `.from_hash` , and instead make it work like `.new` does, by simply yielding the schedule to a block:

Yea, totally makes sense. The code I pasted in the last comment respects that, but I'll make sure to include that in the production code, and possibly include a test for it. Though, I'm not sure off the top of my head how I'd test for this, as the presence of `Time.zone` is a global-ish thing.

You're right about the tests failing at the end of the month, and I think we should fix that.

However, I don't think we should change `day_of_month`. Actually, I think the README is wrong. If you make a schedule that runs monthly starting on the 31st, you can get _every_ month simply like this:

``` ruby
thirty_first = Time.new(2013, 1, 31)
schedule = IceCube::Schedule.new(thirty_first) do |s|
  s.add_recurrence_rule IceCube::Rule.monthly
end
```

(Or you can use `day_of_month(-1)`)

It's possible someone wants only the months when there are 31 days... which is what `day_of_month(31)` would give you. Apple's iCal works the same way if you make a ""custom"" monthly rule:

Allow me to expand on what's actually happening:

When DST is ending, the clock time ""01:00:00"" to ""01:59:59"" happens twice: once in summer/daylight time, and again when the clock rolls back to standard time. I distinguish these two instances of ""1 AM"" as the last hour of daylight time, and the first hour of standard time:

| Term | Description |
| --- | --- |
| DT | Daylight Time (Summer), e.g. -0600 MDT |
| ST | Standard Time (Winter), e.g. -0700 MST |
| DT Last Hour | First Sunday in November, Between 01:00 DT and 1:59:59 DT |
| ST First Hour | First Sunday in November, Between 01:00 ST and 1:59:59 ST |

You'll find it's actually fairly unnatural to create a local Time within the DT Last Hour:

```
dt_time = Time.local(2013, 11, 3, 0, 59, 59)
#=> 2013-11-03 00:59:59 -0600

st_time = Time.local(2013, 11, 3, 1, 00, 00)
#=> 2013-11-03 01:00:00 -0700
```

These two look like they should be one second apart, in fact they are 1 hour + 1 second apart; the whole DT Last Hour is skipped. You can fool it with `dt_time + 1` to ""slide"" into the DT Last Hour. And, of course, you can also get there using _parse_.

IceCube also jumps over the DT Last Hour when traversing daily rules, so that:
- We follow the ruby way when using Time.new (.local) to avoid ambiguity
- We avoid the possibility of duplicates by traversing both DT Last Hour & ST First Hour.

The only time you'll run into your double-occurrence problem is when you explicitly create a daily schedule that starts within DT Last Hour. Normally when traversing over DST, the intervals between daily occurrences are:

| Occurrence | interval to previous time |
| --- | --- |
| 2013-11-01 01:30:00 -0600 | start = 0 |
| 2013-11-02 01:30:00 -0600 | 24 hours |
| 2013-11-03 01:30:00 -0700 | 25 hours |
| 2013-11-04 01:30:00 -0700 | 24 hours |

(In March there's a 23 hours)

When you create a schedule that actually starts in DT Last Hour, that's not a ""normal"" time we'd ever traverse for a daily rule, so your initial start time before the schedule adjusts itself to get on the right track is an extra:

| Occurrence | interval to previous time |
| --- | --- |
| 2013-11-03 01:30:00 -0600 | start = 0 |
| 2013-11-03 01:30:00 -0700 | 1 hour |
| 2013-11-04 01:30:00 -0700 | 24 hours |

I would recommend not creating things that start in DT Last Hour. Traversing over it works fine, just not as the start time.

I suppose that's not 100% avoidable, so it might be reasonable to skip the ""correct"" scheduled daily occurrence for Nov 3 so there aren't two occurrences on the same day. It just means the 25-hour interval happens one day later than normal:

| Occurrence | interval to previous time |
| --- | --- |
| 2013-11-03 01:30:00 -0600 | start = 0 |
| 2013-11-04 01:30:00 -0700 | 25 hours |
| 2013-11-05 01:30:00 -0700 | 24 hours |

Does that make sense?

Thanks for the extremely thorough investigation and write up. What you're saying makes sense. Unfortunately, as it's client input into a multi-tenant system which is supporting multiple timezones, we can't entirely avoid this situation. I put a super ugly hack into our code to prevent things from getting out of hand, but this is just a temporary fix.

Is it possible to add a check in `ValidatedRule#shift_time_by_validation` to check if the time is in the DT Last Hour? If so, it could set `dst_adjust` to true? Just a thought, as you know this library significantly better than me.

This is:

- until: 2:00 AM
- repeat: daily

That first occurrence is also 2 hours long, but the second 1AM is not shown. There is no second occurrence after the clock change, and the 1 hour time difference is deferred until the next day.

So, in iCal you scheduled a recurring daily two-hour appointment on Sunday. Are you saying that the occurrence on November 3rd at 1AM (the last hour of daylight savings time) was basically cut into two one-hour occurrences? One one-hour occurrence that began at 1am before the clock rolled back, and one one-hour occurrence that occurred after the clock rolled back, also at 1am?

I _think_ that makes sense (insofar as daylight savings itself ""makes sense"").

No. It's still one occurrence, duration 2 hours, but, there's only one ""1 AM"" shown on the grid. The other days are also 2h durations, so they stop at 2:59:59 instead. Just for giggles, I tried creating an event for each ""1AM"", and they show up side-by-side even though they're 1 hour apart:

Ah, got it, thanks for explaining.

That handling makes sense for this particular example (a 2-hour appointment where the first hour coincides with the last hour of daylight savings). However, let me throw out a couple of other examples that don't quite compute to me, at least not in a way that I can think about them in an algorithmic way:
- Scheduling a 1-hour occurrence that starts at the same time as the first hour of standard time (ST).
- Scheduling a 3-hour occurrence that starts at 1AM DT on November 3rd (the example you've laid out here, but 3 hours instead of two).

No problem here. First hour of ST has already rolled over and is ""on track"".

> Scheduling a 3-hour occurrence that starts at 1AM DT on November 3rd (the example you've laid out here, but 3 hours instead of two).

We convert end_time into duration internally, so whatever is the duration of the first occurrence will extend to all occurrences. In this case, because it's created in that limbo hour, the occurrences will have an extra hour duration if you defined it using an end_time.

Note from my first iCal screenshot above, it looks like I'm setting up 1:00AM to 2:00AM, which looks like 1 hour duration... but actually it's two hours because of the time difference from 1:00AM DT to 2:00AM ST.

IceCube already natively serializes to/from YAML with the correct zone information if you use `Time.zone` in Rails. I think parsing time shouldn't be a core function of this library, there are already other tools for that, e.g. extended core Time (with `require ""time""`):

```
require 'time'
Time.parse('2013-07-03T04:00:00.000Z')
# => 2013-07-03 04:00:00 UTC

I am setting Time.zone to the user's location before each request in my application controller, and that might have caused IceCube to add the zone information.

True that ISO time format does not have time zone information, but ISO time format is very useful since it is universally usable throughout rails from front end to back end. In my use cases and several others which I observed from searching the internet, it seems like a convention to store time information in UTC in DB and then display it in local time zone to the users, so to me ISO time format contains all the equivalent information already.

I stuck a `puts` into my local copy of the code and found that `hash[:until]` on line 52 of rule.rb equals `{""time""=>""2013-07-15T19:45:00Z"", ""zone""=>""Pacific Time (US & Canada)""}`.

So, the problem is that `TimeUtil.deserialize_time` expects the hash keys to be symbols, not strings. This is likely happening because the structure is being serialized and re-built by a the recurring_select middleware.

So, either the middleware needs to produce hashes with symbol keys, or ice_cube needs to support both string and symbol hash keys.

Each rule has a set of validations which must be met for a time to be included in the schedule. Each validation either returns 0 for a given time if the time matches, or a positive number to jump ahead when this validation would next be valid, e.g. next day, next month, next year, etc. It then jumps to the nearest possible interval from the set of validations and runs again.

See the `validation_accepts_or_updates_time` method which orchestrates it:

https://github.com/seejohnrun/ice_cube/blob/master/lib/ice_cube/validated_rule.rb#L115

Then, each validation has a ""validate"" method that returns a jump number in seconds (0 = match). This line does a lot of the jumping magic for finding the next fixed interval (plus the special case methods `validate_hour_lock` & `validate_day_lock`):

So you'd have a table that would store something like

Schedule
- serialized_ice_cube_data
- day_of_week

Last year I thought of picking up that gem and making it work with IceCube but in the end I wasn't sure how all the different rules could be made to work for all that iCalendar & IceCube support.

As John points out, if you know what kinds of rules you need, you can generalize for that case & store flat instances in the database. That's what we do.

In our case, although we store the IceCube schedule serialized in the database, it serves as a ""generator"" for populating a related calendar_occurrences table as a callback when saving the calendar.

  1.9.3dev :009 > schedule.occurs_at? first_occurrence
   => true
  1.9.3dev :010 > schedule.occurs_at? second_occurrence
   => true
  1.9.3dev :011 > schedule.occurs_at? third_occurrence
   => true
  1.9.3dev :012 > t = third_occurrence.to_time
   => 2013-04-29 14:33:21 +0530
  1.9.3dev :013 > t.class
   => Time
  1.9.3dev :014 > third_occurence_new = IceCube::Occurrence.new(t)
   => 2013-04-29 14:33:21 +0530
  1.9.3dev :015 > schedule.occurs_at? third_occurence_new
   => true
  1.9.3dev :016 > fourth_occurence = IceCube::Occurrence.new(t + 1.second)

  1.9.3dev :017 > schedule.occurs_at? fourth_occurence
   => false
  1.9.3dev :018 >
```

As can be seen above occurs_at? returns true, as expected, when testing against IceCube::Occurrence instances
however same returns false when testing against Ruby's Time instances.

Shouldn't it behave transparently with the given Time instances whether the Time instance is raw created or wrapped inside IceCube::Occurrence instance?

Also the to_s output of recurrence rule added sounds like the schedule should run Daily thrice in a day, however w.r.t the DSL it is the recurrence's rule's end count.

```
   1.9.3dev :002 > schedule.add_recurrence_rule(IceCube::Rule.daily.count(3))
   => [Daily 3 times]
```

""scheduled Daily for 3 days"" or something similar looks more intuitive.Just a suggestion based on my interpretation!

yes, terribly sorry, my mistake. had updated the system but not the project. 

So I'm not entirely sure what `schedule.next_occurrence.end_time` is doing; just using the end_time as the base instead of start_date? 

So I created a schedule like this:

```
{:start_date=>2013-03-18 14:11:34 -0400, :end_time=>2013-03-20 14:11:46 -0400, :rrules=>[{:validations=>{}, :rule_type=>""IceCube::HourlyRule"", :interval=>2, :count=>4}]
```

What I was thinking, was that instead of `schedule.remaining_occurrences` giving me an array that is based on the start_date, something else like it would be based on the end_time but be _backwards_, in that the events lead up to the end_time, not start from it. 

I guess this equally would be applicable/desirable for start_date as well, where I want things to happen _before_ this schedule starts. Like in iCal how you can have alarms 15 minutes before an event starts.

It still uses the schedule's start time as the base, every occurrence is based on that. We've just wrapped up the occurrence times in a class so that instead of having just the time of each occurrence you can also get the occurrence's end if it has a duration:

```
s.next_occurrence.start_time # a time, like before
s.next_occurrence.end_time # new functionality
```

Not sure what you're asking here:

Masking one schedule (""holidays"") against another (""courses"") seems like a useful thing. It think it might be worthwhile to have an example implementation of something like this out there, or at least a page with examples in the Wiki (maybe you could contribute something after you work this out?). Although I've never used IceCube for this sort of thing myself, here's how I might do it.

I'm assuming your courses have a daily-repeating schedule, something like this:

``` ruby
cs101 = IceCube::Schedule.new
cs101.start_time = Time.zone.local(2013, 9, 9, 8, 30)
cs101.duration   = 1.hour
cs101.add_recurrence_rule(IceCube::Rule.weekly.day(1, 3, 5))
     .until(Time.new(2014, 6, 20, 15, 30))
# => [Weekly on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays until June 20, 2014]
```

The above has occurrences like Monday 8:30, Wednesday 8:30, etc... In order to mask these times with your holidays, the holidays should be events with a duration (usually increments of whole days), e.g.

``` ruby
winter_break = IceCube::Schedule.new
winter_break.start_time = Date.new(2013, 12, 23)
winter_break.end_time   = Date.new(2014, 1, 2)
# the whole break is a single occurrence, but you might find repeating rules for these:
winter_break.add_recurrence_time(winter_break.start_time)
# (adding a single occurrence is redundant, should be addressed in #135)
```

You should consider storing each holiday with its own schedule. This will allow for different lengths of events (in number of days) instead of managing individual days & ensuring you have a continuous range. (Then, these can be built into a holidays.ics calendar by wrapping each schedule in a [VEVENT](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5545#section-3.6.1).)

Now, when holidays change, you can update your master ""exception days"" list. This doesn't even need to be persisted as it's just a dynamic set (or array) of dates generated from the holiday schedules.

``` ruby
def Holiday.flush_exdates!(future = nil)
  future ||= Date.new(2014, 12, 31)
  @exdates = pluck(:schedule).reduce(Set.new) do |holidays, schedule| 
    schedule.occurrences(future).each do |occurrence|
      holidays += (occurrence.to_date ... (occurrence + schedule.duration).to_date).to_a
    end
  end
end
```

Next, for the course schedules you can either persist the updated extimes into them, or mask them dynamically like this:

``` ruby
def Holiday.is_holiday?(time)
  @exdates || flush_exdates!
  @exdates.include? time.to_date
end

class Course < ActiveRecord::Base
  def masked_schedule(future  = nil)
    future ||= Date.new(2014, 12, 31)
    schedule.dup.tap do |s|
      s.extimes = s.occurrences(future).select { |time| Holiday.is_holiday?(time) }
    end
  end
end
```

I'll close this now, but feel free to continue discussion. If the above works for you, it would be nice to write up the actual solution. (Schedule masking might be a useful feature to have in the future.)

I think this will solve my issue but haven't tried it yet. I will be certain to post in wiki the eventual solution.

I have a question about your code that is creating the winter_break.

``` ruby
winter_break = IceCube::Schedule.new
winter_break.start_time = Date.new(2013, 12, 23)
winter_break.end_time   = Date.new(2014, 1, 2)
# the whole break is a single occurrence, but you might find repeating rules for these:
winter_break.add_recurrence_time(winter_break.start_time)
# (adding a single occurrence is redundant, should be addressed in #135)
```

When you say 'the whole break is a single occurrence', from a business rule standpoint yes. But I don't think that's how IceCube treats it. I think you mean that each day in the range would be an occurrence, right? I read up on #135. Adding the rtime as you do above would add 1 occurrence for the 1st day of the range.  But to add the entire range from Dec 23 ... Jan 1, I would have to iterate over and add the individual occurrences, right? Or add a daily rrule for that range?

``` ruby
winter_break = IceCube::Schedule.new
winter_break.start_time = Date.new(2013, 12, 23)
winter_break.end_time   = Date.new(2014, 1, 2)
winter_break.all_occurrences
=> []
# no occurrences by just specifying the start and end times.
winter_break.add_recurrence_time(winter_break.start_time)
winter_break.all_occurrences
 => [2013-12-23 00:00:00 -0500] 
# this gives 1 occurrence for the rtime we added but not for the entire range 

```

I guess I just want to clarify my interpretation of your comment.

Thanks again.

When you set an ""end_time"" then it has a duration. (This is the same as when you have 1 event that spans across a whole week in iCal.) You can check:

```

# => [2013-12-23 00:00:00 -0500]

```

I suggested keeping each holiday in one schedule with a range like that, but then extracting the individual dates into a flat array/set when you update holiday schedules. This way you can find times for the courses on those days and set them as exception times on the course schedules.

What I meant for ""find repeating rules"" are things like Thanksgiving (`month_of_year(11).day_of_week(:thursday => [3]`) instead of creating each Thanksgiving as a single occurrence time. Either way works fine.

All of the schedule's occurrences are based on the start time, so if you want occurrences in UTC, you have to give it a UTC start time:

```
schedule = IceCube::Schedule.new(Time.now.utc) # or
schedule.start_time = Time.now.utc
```

What about serializing the schedule `to_yaml`? IceCube will also store the start_time with the correct zone that way, and it can be restored easily `from_yaml`. You might also want to look at my [schedule_attributes](https://github.com/avit/schedule_attributes/) gem for going back-and-forth from form inputs. I'm currently working on it, it's not fully documented or released to rubygems, but it works well.

Also, don't use `to_datetime`, DateTime is evil.

```

I pass in a start time of `CST -06:00`, and `next_occurrence` returns a `Time` with no timezone (so UTC), so Ruby doesn't know it's supposed to be CST. This causes a problem when I need to convert to UTC.  If `next_occurrence` preserved the timezone, it'd return `2013-01-24 12:00:00 -0600` and converting to UTC would be simple: `.utc`

But because it loses the timezone, I have to somehow ""fix"" the offset (which seems ridiculously difficult to do for some reason.)  And I have to use `to_datetime` because `Time` doesn't implement `.change( :offset => n)`

The schedule's occurrences are based on the `start_time`. If you run a daily schedule from ""now"" (2:58 PM), it will repeat every day at 2:58 PM and return every occurrence that matches this rule. The other stuff you're adding are ""validations"" for when the daily rule's occurrences will be matched or not. This conflicts:
- Daily starting at 2:58PM on a Tuesday
- But only if it's the 24th hour of the day, the 0 minute and 0 second of the day
- And only if it's Monday

You're never going to find a match for a ""next_occurrence"" since you can't have ""2:58 PM"" and ""00:00:00"" at the same time. 

The weekly rule can figure out ""every Monday"" starting from a Tuesday, so the day validation is not strictly necessary if you just start your weekly rule on a Monday.

I think you just want:

```
today = Date.today
monday = today - (today.wday - 1)

monday_local = monday.to_time
monday_utc = monday_local.getutc + monday_local.utc_offset 

schedule = IceCube::Schedule.new(monday_utc) # or monday_local

The only question I have is item 3: I'm wondering if we should raise an error since it doesn't make sense to add invisible times then strip them out (currently, they show up for ical and to_s but not occurrences). Feedback welcome: is it valid in icalendar to have an RTIME earlier than DTSTART? Possibilities for adding early rtimes (before start_time):
- Accept them, show them consistently in all_occurrences, to_s, to_ical
- Silently drop them
- Raise an error

if RDATE is added that is less than DTSTART change DTSTART to RDATE and add RDATE with previous DTSTART.

Correct, ""terminating?"" just means the schedule has an end _sometime_ because of a rule limit. It doesn't mean it has _already_ terminated. I think the meaning of ""terminating?"" is clear enough, but you're right: we should have more detail in the rdoc for most of the schedule methods.

No, `end_time` should be when the first occurrence ends, for example `end_time = start_time + 3600` for a 1-hour event. To check if a schedule is finished try: `schedule.next_occurrence.nil?

I don't think the schedule can decide this for you so I'm not sure how it can be part of the standard `to_s` representation. In any case it's easy to append `at/on #{schedule.start_time.strftime(...)}` when displaying it yourself.

I'm not sure why you'd need to have a rule in more than one ruleset, it seems like that just adds more complexity. Would a simple string key be sufficient? Or, if it's matched using `include?` then it could be either a string or array...

Possibly:

``` ruby
# group1
schedule.add_reccurrence_rule(
  Rule.daily.month_of_year(1, 2).meta('group1')
)
schedule.add_exception_rule(
  Rule.daily.month_of_year(1).day_of_month(*1..15).meta('group1')

```
1. A chainable `meta` method for setting the tag: this would return ""self"", any thoughts on a better interface for reading the meta attribute?
2. A `rulesets` method for getting partitioned rules: I'm thinking the default key would just be be `nil` for rules with no meta?

About raising UnresolvableRuleException, I wonder if the rules should be validated defensively because the exception could be far removed from the point when the rules are added:
1. Create a schedule with a combination of rules
2. Serialize & persist to database
3. Reload schedule for displaying in public view
4. Exception happens when trying to display next occurrences

I'm thinking that exception should be raised & handled before serializing to database or ical, or any access to occurrences.

```
schedule.rrules = [Rule.daily.month_of_year(11, 12, 1, 2, 3)]

This could easily strip out the matching exception rule and collapse it onto the RRULE without an error. It might be easier to just throw an error, especially if there are validations on these rules then they would have to match exactly.

### Rules of different types

These could just be allowed to serialize: I don't see iCalendar RFC getting updated any time soon so the deprecation of EXRULEs is mostly advisory at this point. Being different types, they would not overlap 100% so that nothing is found.

- recurrence rules
- exception rules
- recurrence times
- exception times

A rule is contained in a schedule; they're not the same thing. (You seem to be confusing these in your problem description.)

It's only when all your rules coalesce into a schedule that you can get the actual occurrences and see what days it occurs on. (For your weekdays example, if you had one rule that repeats weekly on Mon/Wed/Fri and another rule that repeats on the 15th of every month, putting both of these into the same schedule means you'll eventually get _every_ weekday, since the 15th will fall on different days.)

> This renders and array of weekdays that are part of the specific rule. I.E. [""Monday"", ""Wednesday"", ""Friday""]. Is there a better way to do this?

That doesn't render the weekdays that are part of a ""rule"", it's the whole schedule. You won't be able to confidently put these back into a rule again.

For the purposes of your form, you'll need to specify the inputs in a way that mirrors the rules (not based on the resulting occurrences of the schedule).

I have something for handling forms here, maybe it's helpful: https://github.com/avit/schedule_attributes

I handle extracting weekdays from a rule here: https://github.com/avit/schedule_attributes/blob/master/lib/schedule_attributes/core.rb#L73 if you want to use that as an example.

Note, my schedule_attributes is a rewrite of previous versions to make the params hash-to-object mapping code more manageable & flexible... it's still a work in progress. (The README is definitely out of date so don't take anything at its word: best to read the spec examples.)

@dlee I don't get it. What should be used to set the bounding limit for the schedule's occurrences if you don't want them to repeat forever? Say I want my weekly, hour-long event to stop after Dec 31? That's what `schedule.end_time` is for.

Occurrences are just time objects pointing to the start of each occurrence; they don't have an ""end time"".

I haven't had any problems with the existing: `schedule.next_occurrence + schedule.duration` and I don't think `schedule.end_time_for_occurrence(schedule.next_occurrence)` would be better.

That said, what about methods like:

```
next_occurrence_end
all_occurrence_ends
occurrence_ends
...
```

These could simply advance the occurrence times by the duration.

Either that, or implement an Occurrence class as a Time decorator so it can have an `end_time` and `duration` directly:

```
workday = schedule.next_occurrence
# => 2012-11-30 09:00:00 PST

workday.end_time
# => 2012-11-30 17:00:00 PST

You have to use the recurrence rules to add either a repetition count or a last occurrence date (`rule.count(...)` and `rule.until(...)` respectively) to stop occurrences from repeating forever.

That's because it is, in IceCube, at least. The `schedule.end_time` property applies to the whole schedule, not its first occurrence: it behaves like a global UNTIL for the whole recurrence set...

Honestly, I use IceCube purely in Ruby, not for outputting to iCal so I'm not too familiar with the details of the iCalendar spec. I think @dlee is right about it though: if you read the second paragraph of [RRULE](http://www.kanzaki.com/docs/ical/rrule.html) description, it's pretty clear about DTEND and IceCube seems to be using it differently:
- IceCube uses DTEND and DURATION together. The iCalendar spec calls for using either one alone.
- IceCube uses `end_time` for bounding the schedule, not for the end of the first occurrence (hence, it has a mismatch for the exported DTEND value).

#### Given I want lunch 12:00 to 13:00 every day in December:

```
# @dlee's way
s = IceCube::Schedule.new(Time.new(2012, 12, 1, 12, 0, 0))
s.end_time = s.start_time + 3600
s.rrule IceCube::Rule.daily.until(Time.new(2013,1,1))

s.all_occurrences
# => [2012-12-01 12:00:00 -0800]

s.occurring_at? s.start_time
# => true

s.occurring_at? s.start_time + 30
# => false
```

You can see this is limited to only one occurrence, and it has no duration. However, this works:

```
# @avit's way
s = IceCube::Schedule.new(Time.new(2012, 12, 1, 12, 0, 0))
s.end_time = Time.new(2013,1,1)
s.duration = 3600
s.rrule IceCube::Rule.daily

s.all_occurrences
# => [2012-12-01 12:00:00 -0800, ...,  2012-12-31 12:00:00 -0800]

s.occurring_at? s.start_time
# => true

s.occurring_at? s.start_time + 30
# => true
```

The `.to_ical` conversion for @dlee's version looks more correct, it matches the use of DTEND and UNTIL that an event exported from iCal.app would have, but it's not the correct schedule that my version creates in Ruby.

There is probably a more fundamental bug or misunderstanding of the iCalendar spec here...

Unfortunately core Time's minus method doesn't do coercion so there's no built-in `to_time` to leverage here. I'm glad to remove it, but we should be clear about needing `occurrence.start_time` for diffing times. Internally it's easy to change, but it does change the API for users.

However, with ActiveSupport loaded, it should work transparently without yet another monkey patch: their patch of [minus_with_coercion](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/activesupport/lib/active_support/core_ext/time/calculations.rb#L228) has a hook for `comparable_time`.

@seejohnrun, what method were you thinking of adding to TimeUtil? Are you thinking of a `time_diff` just for internal use?

https://github.com/seejohnrun/ice_cube/blob/master/lib/ice_cube/schedule.rb#L367 causes an inconsistent bug:

``` ruby
Time.zone = ""America/Vancouver""
local_midnight = 1.day.from_now.beginning_of_day # future
# => Thu, 29 Nov 2012 00:00:00 PST -08:00

```

The above works as expected: `find_occurrences` uses the future start_time (with correct time zone). Now see what happens when we just change the start time to the past:

``` ruby
s.start_time = Time.zone.now.beginning_of_day # past

s.next_occurrences(2)
# => [2012-11-30 00:00:00 +0000, 2012-12-01 00:00:00 +0000]
```

Note the occurrences have shifted by the utc_offset and the times are plain Time objects (without a time zone).

_UPDATE:_ In the process of writing a failing example against your latest code, it looks like you fixed the UTC offset, but the ActiveSupport time zone still shouldn't get dropped whether Time.now is before or after schedule.start_time.

I believe I fixed the ActiveSupport conditional, and I was just looking into this for plain Time. It should respect: 
- the start time's local zone if present (for DST)
- the start time's `utc_offset` when not in `utc`

Currently these are respected when `start_time` is in the future, but not after the schedule has started. I'm adding some example specs to cover this.

Note, DST won't be respected when the time isn't local to the current system zone, so shifting to other zones can't be done without ActiveSupport:

``` ruby
start_time = Time.new(2012, 7, 1) # => 2012-07-01 00:00:00 -0700
start_time.zone # => ""PDT""
start_time.dst? # => true

start_time.localtime(""-05:00"") # => 2012-07-01 02:00:00 -0500
start_time.zone # => nil
start_time.dst? # => false

start_time.localtime # => 2012-07-01 00:00:00 -0700
start_time.zone # => ""PDT""
start_time.dst? # => true

Doing this found & fixed some other problems related to DateTime but I'm now wondering whether DateTime should even be supported as a `start_time` value, and just put up a warning while converting it to Time, because:
- DateTime behaves more Date-like than Time-like (it just happens to have time-of-day attributes but that's about it)
- it has an inconsistent interface and lacks all the usual methods for calculating & querying
- it's magnitudes slower

It would take some workarounds to properly support DateTime transparently:
- Retain DateTime value in start_time
- Internally convert to Time for all calculations
- Convert occurrences back to `start_time.class` (DateTime) for output

I don't believe this has any benefit. Is there any valid use case for DateTime? 

I vote to remove support by converting `to_time` with warning. Any thoughts, @seejohnrun?

The more ambitious way would be to have a `register_user_validation(""serialization key"", num_arguments, class)` where you could plugin any class (so I would write something like `offset_from_pascha.rb` and call `IceCube.register_user_validation(""offset_from_pascha"", 2, MyApp::OffsetFromPascha)`, and the rest would be taken care of for me).

This is (understandably) a common question.
A few libraries exist, most notably https://github.com/avit/schedule_attributes

The thing is, it's just hard to make a generic schedule form that works for everyone.
It seems everyone has a selection of rule types that are important to them.  I'm sure
there is some way to make it more generic, I just haven't had a chance to give it
a shot yet.

I think it lives best as a separate gem, and if you're going to make something new,
I'd definitely link to your project from the IceCube README.

If you specify a recurring rule with IceCube as you have, you will end up with no occurrence in your time zone on the date when jumping back over DST (the 31st), since that time _does not exist_ at that hour.  Its easy to jump through time at regular intervals, harder to try to repeat events at a consistent time each day when the time you're repeating on isn't always there.

That being said, the hanging is fixed.  It will go out with v0.9.0 likely tomorrow afternoon after I remove the deprecations and integrate a few more fixes

---

Really, issues like this are the heart of what make this library so compelling - there are countless issues with DST, TZ, weekdays, and month lengths that had to be figured out to make any of this work.  My apologies for the hanging and the delay

This is definitely the common use case (and the case I developed the library for and used it for years) - that being said we can definitely switch to strings depending on JSON library

``` ruby
opt = { 'a' => { 'b' => 2 } } # or JSON.parse(data)
opt.deep_symbolize_keys!

To be fair we have insane requirements and needed to get our scheduling down to an average of around a second for all of a user's tasks. ice_cube is really really fast in most scenarios just not some of the lookups though I think `occurs_on?` received some fix not long ago. To give you some more depth we actually preload everything for the scheduler and we don't save records one at a time either. We needed speed so I generate 2 pure sql statements (1 insert and 1 update) that sometimes change between the two thousands of rows.

The interaction supplied by `find_occurrences` is extremely performant.

The problem with `conflicts_with?` and `occurs_on?` is that the insane unrealistic requirements that iCalendar RFC puts on libraries like IceCube (which tries to be backward compatible to that RFC).  The problem becomes: what data structure could you efficiently query (other than a lookup table by second) to determine whether a rule like every 13th and 14th second of the 5th hour starting now but in 2025 occurs at a given time.

We ended up using IceCube to generate data to populate a `schedule_occurrences` table that we used to answer questions like ""what events occur on these dates"", ""does this event occur at this time"", etc.

---

That being said, without complex rules (especially `count`, `day_of_week`s, and non-1 `interval`s which have to always be fully processed from `start_time` due to their nature), IceCube attempts to skip iterating through time and jump by calculating via time offsets.  That's how its able to be so fast at generating dates

If you don't use any of those three devices, I'd love to hear more detail on an individual example that is slow - maybe some code?

```
require 'rubygems'
require 'ice_cube'
require 'active_support/all'
require 'pp'
include IceCube

schedule = Schedule.new(DateTime.new(2012, 05, 1))

pp schedule.occurrences_between(DateTime.new(2012, 05, 20), DateTime.new(2012, 05, 22))
```

Schedule and finding occurrences is heavily tied to the given Time. 
In the above example, the last occurrences will not print 20th May 08:00, 21st May 08:00. 

However, if I change the code to be 

```
require 'rubygems'
require 'ice_cube'
require 'active_support/all'
require 'pp'
include IceCube

schedule = Schedule.new(DateTime.new(2012, 05, 1))
schedule.add_recurrence_rule Rule.daily.hour_of_day(8)
pp schedule.occurrences_between(DateTime.new(2012, 05, 20, 8, 0, 0), DateTime.new(2012, 05, 22, 8, 0, 0))
```

the occurrences are printed fine. Generally Schedules are created somewhere and passed around. The user of this Schedule will not know how to query it using the right Time Offset. It looks like IceCube validates something like that.

Moreover, if I look into schedule.rb and find_occurrences, it starts from the given start_time passed to find_occurrences and checks whether the given time matches with the rule. However, find_occurrences is supposed to give all occurrnces between the given two times.

Actually you can do this with `IceCube` but you will need to create multiple schedules. iCalendar only supports one start and end time per event (regardless of whether it recurs or not).

range = Date.new(2012,10,15) .. Date.new(2013,04,15)
days = if range.first.yday > range.last.yday
  (1..range.last.yday).to_a + (range.first.yday..365).to_a << -1
else
   range.first.yday..range.last.yday
end
schedule = IceCube::Schedule.new
schedule.add_recurrence_rule(IceCube::Rule.yearly.day_of_year(*days))
```

This gives the right recurrences (not minding leap years), but the representation is messy:

_Yearly on the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th, 13th, 14th, 15th, 16th, 17th, 18th, 19th, 20th, 21st, 22nd, 23rd, 24th, 25th, 26th, 27th, 28th, 29th, 30th, 31st, 32nd, 33rd, 34th, 35th, 36th, 37th, 38th, 39th, 40th, 41st, 42nd, 43rd, 44th, 45th, 46th, 47th, 48th, 49th, 50th, 51st, 52nd, 53rd, 54th, 55th, 56th, 57th, 58th, 59th, 60th, 61st, 62nd, 63rd, 64th, 65th, 66th, 67th, 68th, 69th, 70th, 71st, 72nd, 73rd, 74th, 75th, 76th, 77th, 78th, 79th, 80th, 81st, 82nd, 83rd, 84th, 85th, 86th, 87th, 88th, 89th, 90th, 91st, 92nd, 93rd, 94th, 95th, 96th, 97th, 98th, 99th, 100th, 101st, 102nd, 103rd, 104th, 105th, 289th, 290th, 291st, 292nd, 293rd, 294th, 295th, 296th, 297th, 298th, 299th, 300th, 301st, 302nd, 303rd, 304th, 305th, 306th, 307th, 308th, 309th, 310th, 311st, 312nd, 313rd, 314th, 315th, 316th, 317th, 318th, 319th, 320th, 321st, 322nd, 323rd, 324th, 325th, 326th, 327th, 328th, 329th, 330th, 331st, 332nd, 333rd, 334th, 335th, 336th, 337th, 338th, 339th, 340th, 341st, 342nd, 343rd, 344th, 345th, 346th, 347th, 348th, 349th, 350th, 351st, 352nd, 353rd, 354th, 355th, 356th, 357th, 358th, 359th, 360th, 361st, 362nd, 363rd, 364th, 365th, and last days of the year_

Another possibility using exception rules to mask the dates from the first and last months:

```
range = Date.new(2012,10,15) .. Date.new(2013,04,15)
months = range.group_by(&:month).keys
schedule.add_recurrence_rule(IceCube::Rule.daily.month_of_year(*months))
unless range.first.day == 1
  first_days = IceCube::Rule.yearly.month_of_year(range.first.month).day_of_month(*1...range.first.day)
  schedule.add_exception_rule(first_days)
end
unless range.last.day >= 30
  last_days = IceCube::Rule.yearly.month_of_year(range.last.month).day_of_month(*(range.last.day+1)..31)
  schedule.add_exception_rule(last_days)
end
```

_Daily in October, November, December, January, February, March, and April 
/ not Yearly in October on the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th days of the month 
/ not Yearly in April on the 16th, 17th, 18th, 19th, 20th, 21st, 22nd, 23rd, 24th, 25th, 26th, 27th, 28th, 29th, 30th, and 31st days of the month_

Not sure if there is any great solution here. Is there a possibility of representing continuous ranges better than just enumerating them? What about flattening recurrence & exception rules to get a better string representation for this scenario? I could contribute something.

@glennfu, You can use the `start_time` and `duration` on the schedule to record the hours. There's no built-in string representation for the times so you'll have to tack it on yourself.

There are a few requests for smarter string representations, so I'd definitely be open to seeing some word around flattening up contiguous days

As far as the original question, @reedlaw has it right.  iCalendar is a standard, yet fairly weak at describing recurrence rules like this.  An original goal for the library was to be backward compatible with iCalendar, so IceCube purposely stays away from this problem and lets users tackle it with multiple schedules if they see fit.

When you define weekst in a separate validation, the user always has the option not to include it, and the iCal export will be wrong.

From what I see in the code, I'm guessing registering your own formatters that overrule the English ones would be the way to go (and this even works up to a certain point already). The question that lingers in the back of my head is whether that would actually work for romanic and/or slavic languages. They might structure their sentences in a different way. Not a problem we'll face at the moment (our app is Dutch and English), but other people using IceCube might run into issues. Mikko's probably Finnish, so he should be able to shed some light on this matter.

Providing a way to couple it into Rails i18n would be nice too (and is probably what most people will be looking for).

Since there are no rules, the schedule is not `occurring_at` any time.  Duration spans forward from each occurrences, and since:

``` ruby

Whoever decided that we should live in 24 time_zones obviously did not have to programme the darn bugger ;)
I like to think that even though it is a MF*ing pain in something, Core Team is on the right track with the ActiveSupport::TimeWithZone - it's just the rest of us having to adjust :)

If you drop the argument to .in_time_zone it will grab your default (on the server/your development env)

You can use Date.new(y,m,d).to_datetime.in_time_zone - if all you have is a date :)

Calling the methods with a splat should work, since these two are the same:

``` ruby
schedule.rrule IceCube::Rule.day(*[1, 2, 3])
schedule.rrule IceCube::Rule.day(1, 2, 3)

I'm adding a recurrence rule just like above, but for my exception I specified just a date, instead of a date with time. If I include the exact time of the originally scheduled occurrence then everything works fine, and the occurrence is excluded. 

I don't know if this is the desired behavior or not. If it is, having the alias Schedule#add_exception_date is a bit misleading, as the only way you can exclude an occurrence is by specifying the exact date and time.

It looks like the problem is in either SingleOccurrenceRule#next_time or Rule#on? `next_time` returns the exact date/time of the event, while `on?` tries to match exactly to the exception value. Which of course means if you use just a date, it will fail. I could be completely wrong though. I just did a quick glance at the code, and that jumped out, but I might be missing something somewhere else.

## Firstly I agree that I see the same result as you are seeing.

The docs are indeed a little confusing. This comment implies that there should be an occurrence for every day in may

```
# Create a schedule for every day in May
schedule = Schedule.new(Time.now)
schedule.add_recurrence_rule Rule.daily.month_of_year(:may)
```

While this line implies that the behaviour you are seeing (once a year on the start day) is what happens.

   # When are the first 10 occurrences
   schedule.first(10) # [Thu May 13 18:01:46 -0400 2010, Fri May 13 ...]

## So what should the behaviour be?

The iCal spec has a similar example (from here: http://www.kanzaki.com/docs/ical/rrule.html#example)

```
Everyday in January, for 3 years:

DTSTART;TZID=US-Eastern:19980101T090000

RRULE:FREQ=YEARLY;UNTIL=20000131T090000Z;
  BYMONTH=1;BYDAY=SU,MO,TU,WE,TH,FR,SA
or
RRULE:FREQ=DAILY;UNTIL=20000131T090000Z;BYMONTH=1

==> (1998 9:00 AM EDT)January 1-31
    (1999 9:00 AM EDT)January 1-31
    (2000 9:00 AM EDT)January 1-31
```

So it seems the same rule can be expressed in two different ways in iCal. With exactly the same output.

### So reproducing this example in a number of ways using ice_cube

#### Reproducing it like in the issue, we get the wrong behaviour

```
schedule = Schedule.new(Time.local(1998,01,01,9,0))
rule = Rule.daily.month_of_year(:january).until(Time.local(2000,01,31,9,0))
rule.to_ical 
  #=> ""FREQ=DAILY;BYMONTH=1;UNTIL=Mon Jan 31 09:00:00 +0000 2000""

#This seems to be the same as the spec, but:

schedule.add_recurrence_rule(rule)
schedule.first(10) 
  #=> [Thu Jan 01 00:00:00 +0000 1998, Fri Jan 01 00:00:00 +0000 1999, Sat Jan 01 00:00:00 +0000 2000, Mon Jan 01 00:00:00 +0000 2001, Tue Jan 01 00:00:00 +0000 2002...]
  # this is not the same as the spec
```

#### However, if we reproduce the first example from the iCal spec, it works

```
schedule = Schedule.new(Time.local(1998,01,01,9,0))
rule = Rule.yearly.day(0,1,2,3,4,5,6).month_of_year(:january).until(Time.local(2000,01,31,9,0))
rule.to_ical
  #=> ""FREQ=YEARLY;BYDAY=SU,MO,TU,WE,TH,FR,SA;BYMONTH=1""

schedule.add_recurrence_rule(rule)
schedule.first(10)
  #=> [Thu Jan 01 09:00:00 +0000 1998, Fri Jan 02 09:00:00 +0000 1998, Sat Jan 03 09:00:00 +0000 1998, Sun Jan 04 09:00:00 +0000 1998, Mon Jan 05 09:00:00 +0000 1998, Tue Jan 06 09:00:00 +0000 1998, Wed Jan 07 09:00:00 +0000 1998, Thu Jan 08 09:00:00 +0000 1998...]
  # this is correct
```

### I haven't had a chance to dig into the code yet, but in summary:
- There does seem to be a discrepancy, even in the docs as to what is expected
- The behaviour for ""Daily in May"" differs from the iCal spec for the same iCal rule for some rules.

- Clarify that the other example you listed outputs data different from the spec.

Even weirder because we're using the same parser - but it must have been garbled somewhere else - maybe a really old version would have been incompatible with a #to_yaml ice_cube was trying to perform.

Ask it questions like:

Then you can just store

schedule = Schedule.from_yaml(yaml)

for you, and have a controller action that gets the data back and moves it
into an ice_cube schedule.

Once its an ice_cube schedule, you can store the to_yaml in the database.

To go back to human readable you can either call schedule.to_s, or iterate
over the schedule#rrules, and call to_s on each of those.  You'll get
schedule by using `schedule = Schedule.from_yaml(yaml_from_db)

hope this helps,

Thanks for the good work.  I changed a bunch of your unit tests to not use Time.now - since the end of the day / end of the year tests would fall over randomly if run at bad times.

I'm getting some failures on a few unit tests now:

```
it 'should get the next occurrence from now' do
  start_time = Time.local(2010, 1, 1, 10, 0, 0)
  schedule = Schedule.new(start_time, :end_time => start_time.end_of_day)
  schedule.add_recurrence_rule(Rule.hourly)
  schedule.next_occurrence.should == start_time + 1.hour
end
```

And:

```
it 'should get the next 3 occurrence from now' do
  start_time = Time.local(2010, 5, 13, 10, 15, 0)
  schedule = Schedule.new(start_time, :end_time => start_time.end_of_day)

Sorry for the delayed response - really busy weekend here.
Thanks for the contribution!  These methods are definitely a great addition.
- remaining_occurrences looks great
- next_occurrence is a little inefficient because we calculate further ahead than we need to.  Really next_occurrence_after should be implemented in a way that it walks forward from the schedule's start_date, and breaks at the first occurrence that is after a given time.  Then next_occurrence would be next_occurrence_after(Time.now).  **Maybe even further to implement them all as nth_occurrence_after(1, Time.now)**

^^^ For examples of how this would work check out occurrences_between and find_occurrences

I'm going to take your changes as-is, and head back for next_occurrence optimization later (if you want to give it a shot, that'd be sweet too).

Should _not_ return Time.local(2010, 6, 29), since it falls out of the range of Time.local(2010, 7, 1) and Time.local(2010, 8, 1)

For the behavior you'd expect, you can use the .occurrences method instead:

```
schedule = Schedule.new(Time.local(2010, 6, 29))
schedule.add_recurrence_rule Rule.monthly.day_of_week :tuesday => [-1]
schedule.occurrences(Time.local(2010, 8, 1))

```

That's really very far from the truth. You're forgetting at least
imports, setting module-level variables, python 2/3 compatibility code 

Take for instance the site.py module, which is even loaded by default.
Executes lots of things upon import. Or six, which pretty much
dynamically generates itself upon umport.

That's a bug in your tests. If you don't use NetworkManager, don't
import python-networkmanager.

Let's make more relevant comparisions on how modules are implemented in python. I chose a few I've been using, that also communicate with other parts, just like python-networkmanager.
- pyserial - Possible to import module without any serial device connected.
- requests - Possible to import library without internet connection.

What these have in common is that you can import the module regardless of whether you will later be able to call the functions. In this company python-networkmanager unfortunately stick out as less pleasant to use.

Let's assume my tests _are_ broken. How would a good test look according to you? Realize there is no way to mock NetworkManager as it cannot even be imported.

I understand you want singleton semantics, so that multiple objects cannot be created. But please consider this, perhaps there is some good solution you would be happy with?

The constants are usually updated by a script though. Could you do me a favor and do the following:

Delete all lines below 397 (the line that says the constants are generated)
run this in the git checkout: `python makeconstants.py >> NetworkManager.py` (you may need to install NetworkManager -dev/-devel packages for this to work)

That's the reason why I did not publish it until somebody asked for it.
However, the empty dict is generated by NetworkManager itself. The following flow seems to be quite common but ends up in an exception:
- read configuration from NetworkManager
- modify the configuration
- write the configuration back to NetworkManager.

The problem is the ""u's390-options': {}"" object which we get from NetworkManager. This triggers an exception if it is written back to NetworkManager.
The question is: Where is the right place to filter for objects in configurations which are provided by NetworkManager but not understood by NetworkManager?

maybe I am a bit naive, but I don't get the problem with gitlab being in a given path from the host:
- you know the path to gitlab as being the path part in gitlab configuration (in .gitspindle config file)
- you know the url path as the part on the right side of : in remote config

> List all open issues. You can specify [filters](http://github3py.readthedocs.org/en/latest/repos.html#github3.repos.Repository.list_issues) to filter issues. When you specify `--parent`, list all open issues for the parent repository.

but the filters hyperlink is broken since there is no documentation for `github3.repos.Repository.list_issues`.  The closest I could find is `github3.repos.Repository.issues` which suggests that something like `assignee:aspiers` should be a valid filter, but when I try this outside any git repo, I get:

    $ git hub issues assignee:aspiers

Regarding the base64 thing, I was missing the `.decoded` attribute in there. However, why did you get the content directly from the url in `git hub cat` instead of just using `Content.decoded`? 

Right now I left it using `Content.decoded`, but I realized I can revert it back to almost the way it were if there is a reason for it. It turns out only the `_session` attribute was renamed.

On Fedora (which I run) `pip` wants to install directly into /usr which obviously is root territory so it won't work even though I'm in the wheel group (and /usr/local is root:root as well). 

So my answer would be to write something like:

```
To install the latest released version on other systems, assuming python and
pip are installed do one of the below:

Either make a user install: 

    pip install --user git-spindle

or if you have administrator rights and want to make git-spindle available for other users:

    sudo pip install git-spindle
```

I don't have an OSX system to test with so I have no idea if the above will work there.

Here's what happened:

Try 1 - In .gitconfig, I had set `editor = wordpad`. This works normally with git, but here it couldn't start the application.
Here's the traceback:

Try 2 - `editor = wordpad.exe` because I thought it is being run as a program, and not shell command
Again, here's the error:

```

Try 3 - I removed the editor line, to let it launch the default one. But this time a windows error appeared saying app should be run as non-elevated user, which I see is a issue with Gitpad itself and also happens when I use git commit without editor set. Will resolve it separately.

But what to do if you have a `editor = something` set?

I finally managed to get it working, by including the wordpad path to env. I think this was very much a corner case as apparently `cmd` on windows doesnt know the path of wordpad automatically, which is where `shell=true` redirects, but `powershell` knows it automatically even when it is not in the env path.

**So, not at all a mistake from `git-spindle`. It is fixed.** :smiley:

**But I think there is another interesting thing too:**

I saw that `_getitem` tries all env path and also append `.exe` to search for the file on Windows, but when I used just `editor=wordpad` i.e. without the `.exe`, it never actually reached that function. First `_call_` tries to resolve it via popen and just fails, so without `.exe` it will probably never actually reach that `.exe` adding stuff.

- set_origin needs to be less dwim-y (don't try to find a repo in your account)

It seems like `/etc/bash_completion.d/` is fairly widely supported for just autoloading a bunch of scripts (without the auto-loading stuff that happens under `/usr/share/bash-completion/completions/`).

I'm not very familiar with python and setup.py, but if it's possible my suggestion is to install into `/etc/bash_completion.d/` when doing a system install and under ~/.config/bash_completion.d/ on a `--user` install. And then in the docs say that you need to add something like the below to your .bashrc.

```
for comp in ${HOME}/.config/bash_completion.d/ /* ; do
    if [ -f ""${comp}"" ] ; then
        . $comp
    fi
done
```

Either that or just install it _somewhere_ and say that people need to symlink it to whatever directory they use for their completion scripts.

That said, neither git nor gitk themselves seem to care either, at least from reading the commits I've linked. If the environment variable is empty, nothing breaks – it'll use the spec-defined default, `~/.config/git/`. (That's the case on most Linux systems too.)

On Windows (with Cygwin) and FooBSDs, many users likely already have programs using `~/.config/` too. (Dotfiles aren't a Windows thing anyway. It would be ideal to use AppData I guess.)

On OS X, the new path is just a little bit unusual. (Unfortunately I don't know what paths _are_ usual...)
- I could add a whitelist or blacklist for `os.name == ""posix""` or similar.
- I could swap the order so that `~/.gitspindle` remains the default in new installations, with `~/.config/git/spindle` as the fallback path.
- I could make it use `%APPDATA%` on Windows, and [something] on OS X.
- I don't want to withdraw the patch unless it's explicitly rejected. (Even though more and more programs migrate to ~/.config and ~/.cache, I still have 5× ~/.dotfiles than regular files, and I'd like to clean them up.)

Unfortunately I can't do much with this report as is.
- You use git pull-request, not git-hub pull-request
- You don't say what happens
- You don't say what should happen instead (though I can probably guess that :))

I also have no private repos, making it rather hard for me to test any fixes, so I'm relying on you to run some test code later :)

https://github.com/seveas/python-hpilo/blob/8880f692d347e1ac7d0b0de993325d70b69c38aa/hpilo.py#L403

It's problematic on e.g. `Python 3.9.0` on MacOS, where using the above code results in this ssl.SSLError: `('No cipher can be selected.',)`, but changing that line the following way (to drop ""RC4-SHA"") makes it work again:
```diff
-self.ssl_context.set_ciphers(""RC4-SHA:"" + ssl._DEFAULT_CIPHERS)
+self.ssl_context.set_ciphers(ssl._DEFAULT_CIPHERS)
```

I don't fully understand why Python/SSL simply won't ignore this cipher that it maybe doesn't support in that version. [Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ssl.html#ssl.SSLContext.set_ciphers) states:
> If no cipher can be selected (because compile-time options or other configuration forbids use of all the specified ciphers), an SSLError will be raised.

`ssl._DEFAULT_CIPHERS` in this version of OpenSSL evaluates to `DEFAULT:!aNULL:!eNULL:!MD5:!3DES:!DES:!RC4:!IDEA:!SEED:!aDSS:!SRP:!PSK`.

However, digging into the definition of [CIPHER LIST FORMAT (v1.1.0)](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.0/man1/ciphers.html), I see a note about the `DEFAULT` cipher group alias:
> DEFAULT
The default cipher list. This is determined at compile time and is normally ALL:!COMPLEMENTOFDEFAULT:!eNULL. **When used, this must be the first cipherstring specified**.

For OpenSSL v1.1.1, [it says](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man1/ciphers.html):
> The cipher list can be prefixed with the DEFAULT keyword...

Indeed, when moving the ""RC4-SHA"" to the end to let ""DEFAULT"" be first, there is no ssl.SSLError exception thrown:
```diff
-self.ssl_context.set_ciphers(""RC4-SHA:"" + ssl._DEFAULT_CIPHERS)
+self.ssl_context.set_ciphers(ssl._DEFAULT_CIPHERS + "":RC4-SHA"")
```

I can't tell whether RC4-SHA will actually work as I don't have iLO that supports it and likely this version of Python/OpenSSL would not, but I believe is a generally more compatible way of expressing the original intention of this code.

That is a valid point which is outside of the scope of this issue but also needs to be handled. There is one answer with a few implementations. Digital signatures. Linux distros do this quite well for many years now. PIP allows to upload signatures but not to check them. Git has good support for it. In your case, as you download the file on runtime, you would need to check the signature each time. GnuPG and OpenSSL come to mind.

> the firmware is already signed and the iLO won't accept anything that's corrupt.

Do you have details on that signature or is it just a checksum you can calculate yourself? Or perhaps some home-brown crypto which will break if you look at it (example [mec-tools](https://github.com/eigenmatt/mec-tools))?

Linux distro signatures are bootstrapped by embedding trusted keys on the install iso. So when you trust the iso, you trust the updates. For firmware.conf, that bootstraping is a lot more difficult, and due to the firmware verification on the iso itself not quite worth it.

Not necessarily. Your Python module is in Debian (https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=hpilo). When you now harden the down-streaming path too, for example, Debian by implementing #184 you are pretty far with mitigating the bootstrapping problem.

> but am not aware of any tools to break it or any published weaknesses, so that argument is pretty weak as well.

Having dealt with a few firmware formats and looking into reversing and patching one of them ([thinkpad-ec](https://github.com/hamishcoleman/thinkpad-ec/)) I have my doubts for every security feature which can not be reviewed (free access to the source code and build chain) so I would still recommend to do this additionally in python-hpilo. Also, we have no idea how good HPE is with keeping their private keys private. Their website setup does not look too well done at some parts. There is a reason why https://github.com/rootkovska/codehash.db exists. Lets bump our thread model up once more: Targeted attacks.

At least the HPE docs have some details on this:

> Authorized firmware updates – iLO firmware images are digitally signed with a 2048-bit
 private key. The boot block checks the digital signature every time iLO comes out of reset.
iLO checks the digital signature before allowing a firmware update to proceed. Remote
flashing requires login authentication and authorization, including optional two-factor
authentication.
> 
> Image Validation
> The entire image is hashed with SHA256 and signed using Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s RSA
2048-bit private key. This signature block is pre-pended to the firmware binary image.
> 
> Boot-Time Integrity Check
> At boot time, each piece has its signature validated before it is allowed to execute. Subsequent
pieces are checked by the previous ones until iLO is fully booted.

Source: https://support.hpe.com/hpsc/doc/public/display?docId=c04530504

I have some experience dealing with iLO scripting.  Basically, you are executing two commands in one XML script that you need to put in two separate XML scripts:

The FACTORY_DEFAULTS tag causes iLO to erase its NVRAM and schedule a reboot.  Now, here is the catch:  The iLO reboot starts as soon as the XML parser sees the closing RIB_INFO tag.   Anything you add after that closing RIB_INFO tag may not execute properly because, even though the XML parser keeps executing your script, iLO behind the scenes is already preparing itself to go for a reboot and sometimes iLO reboots really quick.    

Because of this behavior, I've seen cases where some iLO settings could get corrupted.  I had this problem few years ago and I contacted HP support.  They told me to separate the XML scripts,or change the order of Tags in order to leave the one that triggers the iLO reboot to the end.

These scripts below will always work.  But, you need to wait until iLO comes back from reboot which could take ~1 minute.

I know your script used to work but, it doesn't anymore.  I had the same problem few years ago when a couple of my iLOs would end up with corrupted SNMP settings.  
My script had multiple RIB_INFO sections just like your script and, since the first section of my script was making changes to iLO network settings (MOD_NETWORK_SETTINGS), all my iLOs were  rebooting at the end of the first RIB_INFO section.  
The result was a totally unpredictable behavior where some of my iLOs were getting correct SNMP settings while others were not. My iLOs were all at the same firmware level but, on different server models. Yet, they behaved differently. It was a disaster.

HP support told me to never add extra RIBCL sections after one that is known to trigger an iLO reboot. Any MOD_NETWORK_SETTINGS change will cause iLO to reboot so, will FACTORY_DEFAULTS by the way.  Making the suggested changes to my script solved my problems for good.

Basically, HP support told me that if you see this response coming from iLO:

```
<?xml version=""1.0""?>
<RIBCL VERSION=""2.23"">
<RESPONSE
    STATUS=""0x0000""
    MESSAGE='No error'
     />
<INFORM>Integrated Lights-Out will reset at the end of the script.</INFORM>
</RIBCL>
```

Any RIBCL section you see executing after this message is not guaranteed to succeed because, iLO is in the process of shutting down. In other words, iLO has began closing its doors and windows and, turning off the lights one by one in order to go for a reboot.

and for encode you can register error handlers or use 'replace' as a
error strategy, which i assume uses the U+FFFD, ‘REPLACEMENT
CHARACTER’ ie � - which should be ok.

It feels like your patch is doing work that is already handled nicely
by string.encode()
And i think it would be preferable to use that =)

Yes, i know it's wrong, it did however solve my problem :)

What I'm saying is that the infrastructure for what you did already exists
in string.encode - no point in duplicating code ;)

Thanks for contributing back! I haven't actually used hpilo_ca sign yet
with an ilo4 so I'm curious to see what the problems are.

To generate a patch for uncommitted changes: git diff
To generate a patch for changes you already committed: git format-patch origin/master

That would be a nice idea. I don't generally visit iLO's this way, but
can see that it would help in other use-cases. It would require a new
certificate when the IP address changes though, but that's not a big
deal.

There's also the problem that the iLO generates the CSR, so we have to
mangle it to include the subjectAltName (and hope the iLO actually
supports this.

I was using the 2.9 release but the code hasn't changed much, so the 
patch may apply. One thing to note is that when requesting a CSR it can 
take the iLO about 12 mins to prepare one. I've only tried this with iLO 4.

With blade enclosures the on-board administrator is the easiest way to 
go as all 16 blades are accessible from one interface. From there we can 
click onto the individual iLOs and their remote consoles.

This does work, I used hpilo_cli to generate the CSR, It seems that the 
iLO need the FQDN of the host to accept the certificate and any change 
to the network settings causes the certificate to reset to the default 
useless one. The CSR generated by the iLO includes a subjectAltName for 
the FQDN and the host name but not the IP address. So I have to add one 
when signing the request. I wasn't sure if this was possible with 
openssl but found the answer that it is possible (from TinyCA). I 
manually signed the certificate and imported it with the import 
certificate command. It worked and no more untrusted certificate.

BTW I think that HP have broken their RIBCL commands with iLO4 version 
2.10 as they now return an error saying ""Error writing xml_header"", I've 
a case with HP about this error message.

Kind regards

Anonymysed versions are hard to parse. If you don't want the output to be publicly visible, please run the following command:

```
hpilo_cli your.ilo.ip get_embedded_health --save-response=for_dennis.txt
```

and mail the generated for_dennis.txt to dennis@kaarsemaker.net - any anonymisation you want to apply should be done only by replacing characters with the same number of characters, so do not add more characters or remove parts of the data.

Anyway, I'm afraid the bug is not in python-hpilo, but in your expectations. AHS, and thus GET_AHS_STATUS is only supported in iLO 4. The fact that the iLO returns 'Syntax error' is a [known issue](http://seveas.github.io/python-hpilo/troubleshooting.html#syntax-error-line-0) which is annoying but impossible to fix in python-hpilo.

isnt it possible to catch all this syntax error crap in a special exception e.g. IloSyntaxError? Maybe you could also check if the command is valid for the current iLO version? A List with iLO version and their supported set of commands would be great and a timesaver. Did you thought about that?

- It requires me to maintain that list

Thanks that was very helpful.  I have it working now.  I had to set the
.text property after creating the element, maybe there is a better way to
do this in the docs but the text= inside the constructor didn't seem to
work the way we expected it to.

Finally, how do I provide output of the command in the way you want it?

I have been referring to

as
an XML reference.

It's the first time I've attempted to produce any patches for other people
code (and my first time with python and git). My apologies if you don't
find what I have written immediately useful, I hope that at least
even manually merging some of the changes would be helpful to you. Would
you be willing to give me any more specific examples of what you find
sloppy. If I find time to make any further changes to the code I would like
to try and provide them in a form that you find acceptable for merging in.

Thanks

* decide on which will be merged into the other. I'll use merging juwelier into jeweler for the rest of this, but definitely open to discussion
* in juwelier, add a dependency on a specific version of jeweler
* remove most of code in juwelier except enough to act as a shim, ie:
```ruby
require 'jeweler'
Juwelier = Jeweler
```

I would be happy to take over Jeweler and maintain it. Or you can simply make Juwelier the ""official"" alternative. As to the namespace issue, I was planning to address this at a later date.

One of the things I intend to do is integrate it with semver as an alternative to doing the versioning. Since many are undoubtedly using the current Jewler versioning approach, I would leave that in.

In any case, let me know what you wish to do.

I'd be okay with making juewelier the official alternative, I just would worry about the upgrade path for existing users. Here's the path I'm imagining, for whichever is sunsetted:
- add compatibility namespace for the official thing (ie Jeweler to Juwelier, or viceversa)
- add a deprecation warning for the original namespace to indicate to use the official namespace, with a version that it will be removed (major release).

I'll let you decide which one would be easier. I'd vote for keeping the jeweler name because it'd probably be easier for users, but it might be more annoying to do the PR for it in the other direction.

Do you think there are more new Juwelier users, or existing Jeweler users? There are rubygems.org download stats, but those are for all time so it wouldn't be possible to account for any users that have found other solutions.

If you are going to do that, you could make juwelier a dependency of jeweler, implement the namespace idea I was talking about, and have the jeweler files just print a deprecation notice.

This way I **can't** run **the same command** on each release but have to use the current git release branchs name. Now I have two questions remaining to make this work really well with jeweler:
1. How can I tell jeweler to use the **current** branch to prevent changing the command on each release
2. How can I **prevent** jeweler from **automatically tagging** the specified branch (git-flow does this itself on the master branch when merging the release branch)

What I do know is that multiplatform gems are tricky with jeweler, because the gemspec only gets evaluated once, and then written to disk. At the time it's evaluated (or enhanced), it's on a specific RUBY_PLATFORM doing so. The Gem specification does not, to my knowledge, have a builtin concept of platform. You'd have to release separate gems for that.

It just adds a few pieces of conditional logic for the ruby version. It would probably be better to check the rubygems version instead, since you could (I assume) have newer rubygems on older rubies.

#### Ruby 2.0 fixes

Ruby 1.8 is soon going to be dead. If it's just Ruby 1.9 and 2.0.0-p0 that are to be supported , 
1. Replace rcov with simplecov
2. Replace ruby-debug with debugger

#### RubyGems 2.0.0 fix

If Gem::VERSION < 2.0.0 , use Gem::Builder.new(gemspec).build , else
use Gem::Package.build(gemspec)  
I'd sent a PR #237 , but that doesn't take care of backwards compatibility for RubyGems < 2.0.0

So, one thing I'm concerned with is having `gem (RUBY_VERSION =~ /^1\.9/ ? ""simplecov"" : ""rcov"")` be in the Gemfile (both jeweler, and newly generated projects. Part of the problem is that this conditional is evaluated at **runtime**, so if you run with 1.8, you get rcov. The other part of the problem is this then gets persisted to the gemspec as rcov. That's a problem if I release it with 1.8, and then someone using 1.9 runs `gem install jeweler --development`.

Does that make sense at all? If other people are accomplishing this, I'm not sure how they are doing it yet.

Put another way, the gem specification itself doesn't have support for dependencies per ruby version, ruby 1.8 vs 1.9. Without that, doing this 'right' gets a little hard :(

Does that make sense at all? Let me know, or if you have any other ideas on this.

That all aside, one lesser comment is that `lib/jeweler/templates/other_tasks.erb` looks like it has some changes to indent the tasks. Because they are in erb blocks, those are intentionally aligned with the left column so they get rendered without the extra space.

The idea is to include rcov and simplecov together all the time and to figure out what to run during the run time.
For example, I actually built jeweler with ruby 1.8 and installed it with ruby 1.9. I did not run into any issues because the run time evaluation picks up the correct path.
References to rcov appear in a Gemfile and Rakefile. Gemfile is evaluated by bundler to install dependancies. Typically, independent gem repositories are maintained for ruby 1.8 and ruby 1.9. Jeweler installed with ruby 1.8 will be used with ruby 1.8 and jeweler installed with 1.9 will be used with 1.9. 
Now, the rcov appearance in the Rakefile. lib/jeweler/templates/other_tasks.erb is indented because because Rcov now appears in the else clause like the following:

<pre>
if RUBY_VERSION =~ /^1\.9/
  desc ""Code coverage detail""
  task :simplecov do
    ENV['COVERAGE'] = ""true""
    Rake::Task['spec'].execute
  end
else
  RSpec::Core::RakeTask.new(:rcov) do |spec|
    spec.pattern = 'spec/**/*_spec.rb'
    spec.rcov = true
  end
end
</pre>

Evaluating Ruby version at run time is how I enable 1.8 and 1.9 support in my other projects. I am not aware of a cleaner solution, but the run time evaluation has been working for me pretty well. RVM allows me to switch between Ruby version for testing with ease.
Check it out. I think you will like it. Look at it this way: the code just adds a very specific code path that is enabled for only Ruby 1.9 and rcov parts. No other variables are affected by the code, and Ruby 1.9 + rcov code path does not work in existing condition anyway.

There's two issues at work here:
- having a Rakefile that works correctly in 1.8 or 1.9
- carefully managing dependencies not to introduce 1.8 or 1.9-specific dependencies into gems at build time based on what you happen to be running

You covered the first issue at least, but it's the second one I'm really worried about (maybe unnecessarily?). I'll see if I can put together something that demonstrates what I'm getting at.

Before I do that, I had an idea that kind of circumvents that issue. The main thing is that it's in the development dependencies. In reality, is rcov/simplecov really a development dependency? You don't need it to run the test suite, which is what the development dependencies are for. Perhaps we can make a different grouping, like 'rake' to reflect it's only needed when running rake?

The way Ruby came out, we will have to live with 1.8 and 1.9-specific dependencies for some time. Jeweler already has a piece of code that deals with 1.8 / 1.9 dependencies - ruby-debug support. Dealing with Rcov/Simplecov is done in very much the same fashion.

In the case of Rcov/Simplecov, the 1.8/1.9 dependencies are external gems. Figuring out external gem dependencies is what we have the Gemfile and the bundler for. As long as the Gemfile is taken care of, bundler will figure out external dependencies. Rcov/Simplecov are test coverage tools, so we are very unlikely to see gems requesting rcov/simplecov specifically as a dependency. The gems that depend on gems dependent on rcov/simplecov is beyond my imagination. We are far more likely to see the gems dependent on gems dependent on ruby-debug.

I was thinking whether Rcov / Simplecov really belong into development dependencies too. I think Rcov / Simplecov support should be in the same way Jeweler is dealing with testing framework - --rcov --simplecov. This is a bigger discussion and a bigger rewrite, however. The impact on people upgrading Jeweler in existing projects has to be considered in this case.

An argument can be made that Rcov/Simplecov are there to help the developer figure out what parts of the code are untested and thus should belong to the development group.

I would definitely want Simplecov support in Jeweler. Simplecov is something that I use very often. The bits on how to run it and how to integrate it with RSpec are worth several hours of figuring out on your own. I thought I'd share that.

For now, the best bet I think is going to make a clean task (since it doesn't exist), and have release do that first, like you recommend.

Also worth noting that bundler uses this same style of using stuff that's in git to build, so they probably need an issue opened for something similar too.

Possible. This would only be feasible at project generation time though.

I like this idea. You'd have  control at generation time, but could also have a sane default for the platform you are on.

One thing worth doing here is trying to figure out how to avoid this kind of thing. Curious, was there any docs out there that lead you to add `gemspec` to the `Gemfile`? I know bundler generally encourages this, but it's kind of contrary to how jeweler handles it.

Maybe I can do something in jeweler where it detects if `gemspec` was called.

I also have a suspicion on _why_ this is happening when called from jeweler, but not from the command line directory. I think it's safe to assume everyone here is using jeweler's bundler support, yeah? If that's the case, when gem install is called out to, it is running in the same shell ENV as jeweler, which has had the bundler action loaded up. And something in that is causing things to flip out.

I did another local hax to the install command to dump the output of `env`, and then compared it to being run outside the env. Here's the diff, sans some noise, with outside jeweler being `<` and inside it being `>`:

```

> BUNDLE_BIN_PATH=/Users/technicalpickles/.rvm/gems/ree-1.8.7-2011.03/gems/bundler-1.0.15/bin/bundle
```

In addition, I tested against more bundler versions. @tusharr mentioned 1.0.10, but turns out it worked up until 1.0.12, and everything after that fails with the usual error.

I did some rubygems testing as well against bundler 1.0.15, and it looks like it worked with rubygems up through 1.7.2, breaking with 1.8.0 through 1.8.5

$ mate /Users/kristianconsult/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.2-p136/gems/jeweler-1.6.0/lib/jeweler/commands/install_gem.rb

Changed 'sh' to 'Kernel::system'. Works!

PS: Would be better with a #system_exec method to wrap this IMO.

<pre>
class Jeweler
  module Commands
    class InstallGem
      def run
        system_exec ""#{gem_command} install #{gemspec_helper.gem_path}""
      end

      def system_exec command
        output.puts ""Executing #{command.inspect}:""
        Kernel::system(command)
      end
...
</pre>


Also it fails when trying to release a gem:

undefined method `sh' for #<Jeweler::Commands::ReleaseToRubygems

<pre>
class Jeweler
  module Commands
    class ReleaseToRubygems
      def run
        system_exec ""gem push #{@gemspec_helper.gem_path}""
      end

      def system_exec command
        output.puts ""Executing #{command.inspect}:""
        Kernel::system command
      end
</pre>


Both classes better inherit from a Jeweler::Commands::Executor class that encapsulates execution of system and gem commands. 

I abstracted the above into an Executor class with a run, print and system_exec method which the individual Command classes can then inherit from. Makes for a much more generic, DRY and simlple design and ensures they operate the same way.

As for why restricting rake release to having a clean staging area is to basically ensure that releasing gets all the files you expect to. For example, it'd be pretty easy to forget to `git add` a new file, and release the gem without it being in version control.

Doing the steps you mention 'works just fine' like you said, so there's nothing really stopping you from doing that. Should note that release does a few other things, like makng a git tag for x.y.z.

And review long sections of source code can be exhausting for someone. 

Development of the Jeweler is currently generally suspended. You should try to implement it in its successor Jeweler2 at https://github.com/appoxy/jeweler, but it has been cleaned up and contains base tasks only so I'm really not sure Travis will want include this feature.

So another possibility is to ask Josh for continue development of this project because he doesn't plan to develop Jeweler anymore. He is open to this alternative too.

I am glad for Josh to hear that he has decided to drop / suspend his work with the original Jeweler. Since Jeweler in itself (even without my feature) turned out to be a big ongoing commitment during a time when Josh also became so overloaded with other projects. Clearly I'm also pleased to see that Josh has allowed / turned over development to new developers here.

What else can I say about this feature? Much of the code was brand new code and didn't really depend on the Jeweler-base a whole lot. The amount code and therefore time to review the code would also be essentially the same in the situation were I to re-write the feature to work in Jewler 2.

To take this to Travis right now means your (absolutely correct) comments about the problems here still remain unsolved:

""to review long sections of source code can be exhausting for someone""

What I would suggest is that to boil-down the essence of jeweler is to provide the simplest elegant mechanism to conveniently run one of many possible tasks around the pushing / releasing of deliverables and gem management.

So if the core of jeweler is to remain minimal, then for example why not consider (you and Travis) developing a flexible plugins and backends system for third parties to extend jeweler functionality? The possibilities are endless.

Providing you guys have the fore-sight to implement the right kinds of slots or stubs and in the right way, then it could be (in theory) pretty easy for me could come back later (after your hard efforts to clean up jeweler) and add this feature as some kind of a task plugin (or a new task).

Given that all of the above problems discussed here were related to there being a too-high burden or 'bar of entry' that overloaded the core developers? I hope you can appreciate the suggestion for what it is, and to please see the value in approaching this whole problem in an entirely different way.

Such a plugin system may not be so simple to develop and get right. I would be happy to discuss further the topic of a  plugins system for elsewhere. Ie in a more general context if you and Travis are really that excited / interested. Also please note that for IRC chat i am on UK time (GMT+0). Which translates to be is early-morning only on California time. Or on github issues.

Otherwise just thanks again for comments Martin. Very informative.

That way, you can replay commits one at a time, and have to resolve conflicts one at a time, rather than a ton at once.

If that fails, in your case, I think I would basically abandon master by removing it (ie `git branch -D master` ), and then recreate it off of master19 (ie `git checkout -b master master19`), and then force push the new master to replace the one on github (`git push --force origin master`).

make changes in master19

    git rebase master19

You probably want to add /var/lib/gems/1.8/bin to your path, instead of the jeweler specific one. One thing this does is wrap up the jeweler executable in rubygems' tender embrace, making sure that rubygems is require along with any dependencies before executing for real.

My version of gem is 1.3.5. It's interesting to note that Ubuntu disables `gem update --system` in favour of apt-get, which is why I'm not yet on 1.3.6.

However I just wanted to point out why those sites aren't really the first choice for everyone.

1)
rdoc.info is allright if you've documented everything in Yard. But there are many big / older projects (and new ones!) that are still written in rdoc. And yard doesnt care to support very well at all. So all the rdoc formatting, etc gets all screwed up on rdoc.info. So its better to use hanna templates and push them out to our gh-pages automatically with jeweler. This is also as rubyforge is now getting defunct.

2)
Theres seems to be enough of us who aren't really that overwhelmed with the look and feel of the new Yard template on those sites. Thankfully Loren has written a plugin system into yard. So theres actually people (including myself) who are writing yard plugins which overlay onto that original template with a different layout, improved look and feel, etc.

Not to mention Loren's own plugins for documenting additional things like the rspec tests, etc. However these new yard plugins simply cant be applied to either of the websites rdoc.info or yardoc.org, which run in a restricted fashion. (They wont allow running of arbitrary ruby code on server-side for security reasons). 

But its fine if we can do local generation + gh-pages. Id just like to make this more convenient in jeweler.

Just been looking at your latest code. I like that you have switched to using Thor::Group.
However, I would recommend shifting both the classes Jeweler and Jeweler::Generator to modules. Then have a class Jeweler::Generator::Builder for the builder generator and other classes inside the Generator module for other generators, such as for versioning etc. Each of these classes, such as Builder should inherit from Thor::Group and include Thor::Actions. I see no reason to keep the old Options class except for temporary use while migrating to the new Thor form ;)
I also recommend using the octopi gem for accessing the Github v2 API, fx for use when creating a new github repo.

Also, would be nice if you could specify gem dependencies to be included in the rakefile and maybe set up default stacks using ENV variables or a config file or sth, similar to RVM gem sets. I think it should be possible to somehow setup personal profiles, maybe by using a DSL or sth!?

Example: 

~/.jeweler/profiles
- myprofile.jeweler.rb

You might then specify one or more profiles in a --profiles options and have jeweler load and execute those profiles at the end!? Just a wild idea!

Like Codesponge, I added a `require`, which fixed it. I decided to add it to the top of `lib/jeweler/generator.rb`, which seemed like a better place than in the bin.

I did a quick check, and it appears that `FileUtils` at some point became part of the core, whereas it used to be part of the standard library. My hypothesis is that this change happened in 1.8.7, and thus the module is being required by default in 1.8.7 but not in 1.8.6. I could be wrong--I didn't spend a lot of time diagnosing this.

I think it would be worth including this fix in the next release. I'm guessing everyone on 1.8.6 is going to have this problem.

@behrangsa it's intentional that setting `gem.version` makes the version tasks go away. Generally when you use this, you are keeping it in some constant, so it wouldn't necessarily know how to bump it if you set it this way.

@rgarner wasn't able to reproduce with your repo :( I tested with ruby 1.9.2 and a few variations of rubygems.

There is some good news though. I was able to reproduce on a blank repo. I recently upgraded rubygems all the way up to 1.8.5. I suspect this started coming up between 1.3.7 and 1.8.5.

It's coming up when the gemspec on disk is read into memory and parsed for saneness, ie [right here](https://github.com/technicalpickles/jeweler/blob/master/lib/jeweler/gemspec_helper.rb#L51). For whatever reason, when the version is getting set from the gemspec on disk, the version is nil, which is where the `undefined method`prerelease?' for nil:NilClass`comes in. You can clearly see`s.version` is not in in the gemspec.

Another boggling piece of this is that when you do `rake gemspec`, this does a write then a validate, and this works fine. If you run `rake gemspec:validate` directly, it fails.

I checked on @ahamid's suggestion about prereleases, but it seems to be happening regardless of the combination of 0.0.0 and prereleases

---

That all said, I'm kind of considering ditching the way validation happens currently. But first, a history lesson:

Back when GitHub did rubygems hosting, one of the biggest pain points was having the gem fail to build due to invalid gemspecs, and there were plenty of interesting ways of accidentally having that happen. One of the earliest goals of jeweler was to make it easier to cope with this, and so it did the same eval that GitHub did, and it was great.

Fast forward to today, and well, GitHub doesn't host rubygems anymore, and for rubygems.org, you end up building them yourself. If there's a problem building it, you'll see it pretty quickly :)

Given all that, removing this particular validation seems like a good idea. I'll try to get that out next jeweler hacksession I sit down for, and will likely release it as 1.7.x.

The main problem is the difference between `gemspec` and `gemspec:validate`.
`gemspec:validate` depends on `gemspec:generate` about gemspec_helper. `gemspec:generate` set version string in `gemspec_helper.spec.version` and `gemspec:validate` uses this variable. It seems to be the reason of different behavior.

Another small problem is `jeweler` command doesn't insert `gem.version` into default Rakefile.

The first could bump you to the next major release, and then add a prerelease version. The second could bump an existing prerelease by one.

Additionally, if a gem author wishes it, they are easily able to add it to their own `gem` task that does just as you are looking for.

There used to be a lot more aliases around for a bunch of the rake tasks. In the end, I decided to prune them down so that there was just a canonical way of doing them. So, not wanting to add extra tasks to be compatible with other gem management libraries is kind of in the same vain.

In addition, if I were to want to provide such task-level compatibility, I'd probably want to take a lot closer look at what tasks these other libraries provide. Do they all really have a 'gem' task which builds the gem? Are there any tasks they have that are of interest that jeweler doesn't? Are there any task name overlaps which aren't the same, or that behave different? And so on. For example, hoe has `rake release VERSION=1.0.1`. That's kinda different than the way jeweler works

Yes, I'm feeling rather noobish right now. Just signed up for github and have limited experience with git.

Here's where my confusion came from:

In your readme, it points to using the local github directions for setting the git global config variables (http://github.com/guides/local-github-config)

""Using to start a new project
Jeweler provides a generator. It requires you to setup your name and email for git and your username and token for GitHub.""

I mistook setting the following the global config variables for the ones required by Jeweler.

git config --global github.user name
git config --global github.token token

vs.

git config --global user.name ""name""
git config --global user.email ""email""

Note to self: RTFM! http://github.com/guides/tell-git-your-user-name-and-email-address

From what I cant tell, these variables are passed into the templates which generate the Rakefile. Is it possible to stub them until they're added to the ~/.gitconfig like ""user"" and  ""user@example.com""? (No reply is necessary. Just me thinking aloud.) 

Just upped to the latest version and the generator brewed a delicious project. Can't wait to test it out.

Most of the time, your project is your gem name, so for most cases, it&rsquo;s cool.

Just update your Rakefile to point where you want to be uploading too.

Because it&rsquo;s not a jeweler task, it doesn&rsquo;t actually have access to the gemspec, and hence, the rubyforge_project.

So, I did want to keep it flexible about where you upload files too (maybe you want root to be rdoc, maybe not), and I didn&rsquo;t want to introduce any non-gemspec configuration, so I left this as hardcoded (but generated at least).

I&rsquo;ll at least need a backtrace and a pointer to the source for the project to get an idea what is going on.

Make sure you&rsquo;ve followed the notes in the README about doing rubyforge releases. In particular, there&rsquo;s a rubyforge:setup task.

OK, I found how to fix it, but not why I needed to fix it.

I modified the file ~/.rubyforge/autoconfig.yml from:

 @@@
processor_ids: {}
 @@@
to
 @@@
processor_ids: 
  Any: 8000
 @@@
I looked up at the source of the HTML page in rubyforge that let&rsquo;s you select the processor to get that 8000 value.

So basically, this is not your fault but should be reported to whoever makes the rubyforge gem...

Sorry for the zillions of emails & requests today! I&rsquo;m done after this one, I promise! :-)

Just wanted to point out that after my successful release of my gem, &rsquo;rubyforge config&rsquo; now writes the full list of processor_ids to that auto_config file.

I remember doing &rsquo;rubyforge config&rsquo; as instructed, and again after the &rsquo;rake rubyforge:setup&rsquo; and getting &rsquo;Fetching 2 projects&rsquo;. So probably this happens only to users with completely empty projects? Not sure.

Anyways, if someone is stuck with this, hopefully they&rsquo;ll find this thread.

Thanks again!

I opened the infamous &rsquo;autoconfig&rsquo; file and the release id parts looked like:

 @@@
release_ids: 
  backports: 
    1.0.0: 32948
  packable: {}
 @@@

That seems normal to me, since it&rsquo;ll be the first release of &rsquo;packable&rsquo;. Anyways, added a bogus release:

 @@@
release_ids: 
  backports: 
    1.0.0: 32948
  packable:
    0.0.0: 12345
 @@@

and then it worked. Again, I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s jeweler (maybe) or rubyforge (more likely) that&rsquo;s at fault here.

Thanks!

If you&rsquo;re able to, I&rsquo;d suggest upgrading git. I&rsquo;m on 1.6.0.x, and it works.

If that does the trick, it&rsquo;s a bug in ruby-git, and we can take a look at fixing that gem.

I&rsquo;ve never made a gem with C extensions, hence the lack of support. Not opposed to adding support to jeweler, just not sure how to kick it off.

For some reason I didn&rsquo;t get a notification email for this...

I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d be able to support java or mingw, as I don&rsquo;t use those platform.

From the looks of it, you mostly do checks of the platform, and add extra files depending. Since the Jeweler::Tasks takes a block, you should be able to add the same kind of logic.

The thing is, I can&rsquo;t tell what parts are RedCloth specific (I see a lot of ragel), and what&rsquo;s the platform specific.

Using a commit without a scope e.g. `refactoring: comment out property` should work, or you can define the allowed scopes in your config. I'm going close this issue since this is expected behavior and not actually a bug.

Yeah, I just didn't want to break any of the other configurations. This project has turned into a game of [whack a mole](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoP1E9J4jpg) with all the user-contributed configuration, so it's really easy to accidentally break someone's setup when making what seems to be a tiny and benign change. That said, if you want to submit a PR for that, I'd be open to it.

Long term, I would love to be able to migrate folks off this app and onto GitHub Actions, so everyone can have exactly what they want, and can configure things independently at the repo (or organization) level. See #90

`dependabot` in this example is a **type**, not a **scope**. Yes, we've configured it.  Our `types` config includes `'dependabot'`:
```
types:
  - feat
  - fix
  - docs
  - style
  - refactor
  - perf
  - test
  - build
  - ci
  - chore

@zeke 
Do you have anything that can help us with this issue?  Currently we're using dependabot and every day have 5-15 dependabot PRs stacked up that are not being auto-merged, because of this issue with `semantic-pull-requests` action.  We've done everything to configure it correctly, so need some explanation about why it's not working and how to resolve this.",NA,https://api.github.com/repos/zeke/semantic-pull-requests/issues/105/comments,https://github.com/zeke/semantic-pull-requests/pull/105#issuecomment-795846694,https://api.github.com/repos/zeke/semantic-pull-requests/issues/105

I don't have time to dig into this specific case right now, but I can offer some suggestions:

1. Try stripping down your config file to nothing, then incrementally adding the configuration you need, like the custom dependabot scope. External contributors have added new configuration options over the years, and now the codebase is a bit of a mess and bugs are more likely to come up as your config file grows. I still use this app, but without any custom configuration.
2. If that doesn't work, try forking this repo and creating a test that reproduces your failure scenario. We can work together from there to fix it.
3. Fork the repo, make any changes you need, host it yourself, and create a new GitHub App.
4. Use a GitHub Action like https://github.com/amannn/action-semantic-pull-request instead of this app.

I hope that helps.",NA,https://api.github.com/repos/zeke/semantic-pull-requests/issues/105/comments,https://github.com/zeke/semantic-pull-requests/pull/105#issuecomment-796164854,https://api.github.com/repos/zeke/semantic-pull-requests/issues/105

TLDR:

- Sorry about that.
- Will try to stabilize more in the future.
- Consider migrating to a [GitHub Actions workflow](https://github.com/zeke/semantic-pull-requests/issues/90) for your own safety.

My apologies for the recent downtime. It was caused by a [merged pull request](https://github.com/zeke/semantic-pull-requests/pull/94/files) with some breaking changes that were not caught by the existing test suite.

I am pleased that this service is valuable to people and excited to see that so many developers are embracing semantic workflows for releasing software. On the flip side, this is a side project of mine, and the growing adoption of this service has pulled me away from my regular work.

The app was initially designed for use within the @electron org with a specific use case in mind: **Does this pull request have enough semantic information to trigger a semantic-release when squashed?** When this was the app's only behavior, things were more stable. But as it has grown in popularity, members of the community have come forth with slightly different use cases, and they've contributed changes that have made the application logic much more difficult to understand and maintain. I've made an effort to welcome these contributions and accommodate people's needs, but in hindsight maybe I should have been a bit more discerning about the contributions I've accepted.

Going forward, I will make an effort to be more careful and scrutinous in evaluating new pull requests, bearing in mind that breaking the service could affect many users.

I am also investigating GitHub Actions powered alternatives to this GitHub App. The distinct advantage of Actions in this case is that each user (you) has autonomous control over the configuration of their workflow, and are not beholden to some unknown third party (i.e. me) who may accidentally break things when the service goes down. There's an unfolding discussion about Actions-based alternatives here: https://github.com/zeke/semantic-pull-requests/issues/90

  if (error) {
    console.error(error)

edit: The problem is that `value` is an empty array, which is because of few reasons: 

- `check()` is filtering out `null` and `undefined`
  + like `.filter((x: PossibleCommit) => x !== null || x !== undefined)`
- probably other reasons

Judging by https://github.com/commitizen/conventional-commit-types/pull/13#issuecomment-549189892, it looks like `improvement` was removed from the 1.0.0 spec after all. Is that correct? If so, can this issue be closed?

Thanks for submitting this PR and apologies for the delay reviewing it.

I will start off by saying that I am willing to merge this PR to support your organization's use case. You've added new tests and the existing tests continue to pass, so it appears this new functionality will work.

I will add though that I think the configuration options for this service should be reconfigured somehow. Currently we have these options: `titleOnly`, `commitsOnly`, `titleAndCommits`, and soon `anyCommit`. When considering all the possible combinations in which these options can be used, it's a bit confusing and seems inviting to bugs in the code.

Thinking out loud, what if we moved to something like this:

Prop | Allowable Values | Default
--- | --- | ---
`validateTitle` | `true` or `false` | `undefined`
`validateCommits` | `'all'` or `'any'` or `false` | `undefined`

One thing that would be tricky about making these changes would be there are already lots of users of this service, and if we change the config, then their integrations will no longer work as expected... We'd probably need to update this bot to open issues on repos when their `semantic.yml` configuration is outdated.

https://github.com/fossapps/pr_label_enforcer/blob/6e5eff7ba84e32eef2a9f0cff4e4914c924358f8/Dockerfile#L1-L8

```Dockerfile
FROM node:12-alpine
MAINTAINER fossapps gautam.nishchal@gmail.com
WORKDIR /app
ADD node_modules ./node_modules
ADD ./lib ./lib
EXPOSE 3000
ADD package.json ./package.json
CMD [""node"", ""./lib/server.js""]
```
All you need to update is the maintainer, and CMD part, and maybe minor things, it depends on how you run the app, in my case, I've a server.js which I can simply run :)

Here are some things to watch out for, first you need to do npm install before you do docker build on your CI, or you could do that inside this docker file itself, I'm building and deploying to now.sh from travis automatically, and then I'm doing a docker build, because I want exact same copy, I just copy the lib and node_modules directory, feel free to change a few things.

Once you have a dockerfile, all we need to do is configure sematic-release to release to docker hub, to do that use semantic-release config ([example](https://github.com/fossapps/pr_label_enforcer/blob/6e5eff7ba84e32eef2a9f0cff4e4914c924358f8/release.config.js#L1-L61)) like this:
```js
class SemanticReleaseError extends Error {
    constructor(message, code, details) {
        super(message);
        Error.captureStackTrace(this, this.constructor);
        this.name = 'SemanticReleaseError';
        this.details = details;
        this.code = code;
        this.semanticRelease = true;
    }

                    ""Please make sure to add docker hub user in `DOCKERHUB_LOGIN` environment variable on your CI environment. The token must be able to push docker image"");

```

You already have gh_token on your travis-ci probably that's how you're releasing to github, and now just create docker hub account, create a organization for probot if it doesn't already exists (then I prefer to create a bot account only which has write permissions, but you can do individual account as well, by looking at the config file above, you need to set docker hub user and password on travis)

The reason I like this change is that it paves the way to a future where people don't have to write BREAKING CHANGE in the commit body to signal a breaking change. This will make it easier for newcomers to start adhering to the spec, as most people always write single-line commit messages, and hardly anyone uses the ""body"" when committing.

Specs are not to be easy for newcomers, they are up there for combining and standardizing the things among the biggest part of a community - in this case, us the developers which have experience and we are not newcomers. Also, currently it's pretty clear and easy enough - type, scope, subject, body.

And yes, I agree and understand that most of us don't use the body when committing, even more we don't put scope most of the time. But breaking change is something that should be carefully done and hard to do, that's one point why it's uppercased.

If we are going to do it simple why just don't remove everything and just make the spec to handle only the header part. Specific attention to writing the `BREAKING CHANGE` part is the best thing of the spec. Not to mention that `!` is a single character and no that easy to be seen.

> paves the way to a future where people don't have to write BREAKING CHANGE in the commit body to signal a breaking change

If that gets agreed I'll stop updating the parser to adhere to the spec. I can update it now just because both `!` and `BREAKING CHANGE` are required now (from what I'm understanding from the spec).

@zeke could allow extending it through the semantic-pull-requests config. Or passing different regex to the parser. I'l think of something after the v4 release.

Overall, yea, semantic-pull-requests **is** meant to be following the conventional commits (i guess all this came from Angular and Semantic Release) and that's why it's called that way. But yea, it's not a problem to extend it. I'm open for the `parse-commit-message` too, since it's name is even more general.

Our use case is the following: GitHub doesn't let you choose a default squash commit message. Squashing a pull request with one commit would use that commit’s message, but squashing a pull request with more than one commit will use the pull request’s title for the commit message. We want to make sure that every single external contributor PR in our repo gets merged with a valid squash commit message so checking both would be beneficial for us.

I think the bot stopped working for private repositories when https://github.com/probot/semantic-pull-requests/pull/30 landed, which introduced support for configuration of the bot using a `.github/semantic.yml` file.

@paszkowskiDamian based on your comment above, the timing sounds about right, as #30 landed on November 28.

One way to work around this would be to preserve the current minimally-invasive token scope by disallowing `semantic.yml` configuration for private repos, but that seems weird to have a different behavior between public and private repos. 🤔

About the ""how"" it is a good question: on our side we are accepting ""github"" plugins (developed by github directly) but we are taking care to all others...especially if they are requiring file access.
The reason is simply related to security: we don't know what plugin maintainers do with the retrieved data (are they logging somewhere plugin runtime information?). 

Anyway, take the decision you want for your plugin...we will then check on our side if the security département allow the activation :)

Since this PR is introducing configuration to the project, I think it would be useful to consider other ways people might want to configure the bot so we have a naming scheme that is flexible from the start.

A few configurations come to mind:

- title or at least one commit is semantic (current behavior)
- all commits are semantic
- title is semantic
- title and all commits are semantic

Also, let me play devil's advocate for a moment and suggest that maybe we can make the bot accomodate all use cases without requiring configuration. In #29, I suggested:

> One approach would be to make the bot check what types of merging are allowed on the repo (rebase/squash/merge), and if squash is the only allowed merge type, then the requirements would change and the PR title would then have to be semantic.

Agreed about the improved naming scheme, are you suggesting having them as string options for a `mergeType: 'title_commit'` style property in the config? Or a set of various boolean flags like: 
```
semanticCommits: boolean
semancticTitle: boolean
```
? 

I'm not sure how viable the inferred settings would be but my main reasoning against that approach would be that it moves the configuration out of the code and into Github settings. 
Now every time I want to use my setup in a new repo, I must change Github settings as well as install the bot, instead of just copying the `.github/semantic.yml` file which is both version controlled and it would seem shareable/extendable.

I am also keen to see the outcome of https://github.com/probot/probot-config/issues/23 as I don't like the idea of forcing users to include a config file if they wish to use the default settings as this seems unnecessary, but I'm sure this is just my misunderstanding or missing some config.

Correct. I tried to address that with the wording here:

<img width=""483"" alt=""screen shot 2018-11-14 at 4 00 37 pm"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2289/48520719-830f0100-e826-11e8-923a-9396ec952edc.png"">

However if the PR title is semantic, the message is different: something like ""ready to be squashed"".

I would be open to adding configuration for this... One approach would be to make the bot check what types of merging are allowed on the repo (rebase/squash/merge), and if `squash` is the only allowed merge type, then the requirements would change and the PR title would then have to be semantic.

Alternatively, we could add support for a `requireSemanticTitle` boolean in `.github/config.yml` or something similar...

Yep, that's intended behavior, but thanks for opening the issue anyway.

The goal of this bot is not to police commits, but to encourage gathering the minimum amount of semantic information needed to trigger a release. When using tools like `semantic-release`, a single semantic commit is all it takes, and it doesn't matter whether they're all semantic.

The projects using this bot (namely all repos in the @electron org) have a general practice of squashing pull requests into a single commit. In this scenario, NONE of the commits have to be semantic, as the Pull Request title will become the commit message when squashed.

i may not have explained well enough above, but my use of a `wip` commit type is to signify that the change is ready to go to `master`, but doesnt yet qualify as a `feat` or `fix`. the wip bot [treats it the other way around](https://github.com/greenkeeper-keeper/hapi-greenkeeper-keeper/pull/436#issuecomment-370653846) where `wip` is meant to mean that the commit is meant to be squashed or rebased away before merging. its not the only place i've come across the conflicting meanings, so i've considered using something other than `wip` but haven't yet since it still makes sense to my teams in the context of projects preferring continuous integration. i'm looking forward to the wip bot being [configurable](https://github.com/wip/app/issues/96) so that i can use it in a way that doesnt worry about commit messages.

while that detail is probably less important to my request above, it does highlight the benefit of flexibility that could be added by looking at a commitlint config. different users could assign whatever meaning they intend through such a config, without the bot being directly aware. you certainly wouldnt want to include options for this bot directly to enable all the variations of deviation from conventional-commits that people may want, but using an existing config file might make including the flexibility more reasonable.",NA,https://api.github.com/repos/zeke/semantic-pull-requests/issues/22/comments,https://github.com/zeke/semantic-pull-requests/issues/22#issuecomment-417078269,https://api.github.com/repos/zeke/semantic-pull-requests/issues/22

- Color contrast is very good but the yellow a bit flashy for me 🟡
- Using a circle is problematic with GitHub allowing .png with transparent background but force to use a white background anyway `style=""background-color: #ffffff""` (as seen as an action there is a white background and I do not like it very much due to the grey background surrounding the logo - check image below)
- The second logo is indeed not perfect for the GitHub action (the pen is not visible enough I think) - check image below

**Current logo used for the GitHub action:**
https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/in/9517?s=40&v=4

**Current logo display from the GitHub action:**

@zeke multiple questions here:

- [ ] Do you wish to keep the same colors?
- [ ] Do you wish to keep the logo as a circle?

**Thoughts:**
I like the ""PR schema"" in the logo I provided but adding to it the notion of ""this project check the semantic"" is very hard due to not having enough space 😭 
This idea could be provided with a color change (classical red/green to show that it ""validates"") but honestly I am not seeing this with a sexy eye.
I will provide another shot at this later but any advice is welcome 🙄 

I just crossed this issue and provided a quick logo but please do not feel the need to change the logo if you are not confident enough about these propositions.

For this fix what would you suggest to do:
1. fix the behavior of the handler when `titleOnly` option set to `true` in order to check by default the PR title, but in case there's only one commit then check the commit's message
2. create a `squashMerging` option to define the separate behavior

https://github.com/kentcdodds/validate-commit-msg looks pretty much perfect and fits all the needs of our project:

```
> validate_commit_msg('fix: something')
true
> validate_commit_msg('build: something')
true
> validate_commit_msg('build(foo/bar): something')
true
```

However that project is archived, and it is recommended to use `commitlint` instead. But `commitlint` seems to be designed primarily for use as a CLI, and trying to use it programmatically means navigating through a maze of numerous subpackages in the @commitlint scope...

I like the idea of following the spec outlined at https://conventionalcommits.org, so we have a common understanding of what we're adhering to.

I hate to say it, but maybe we should just hardcode this list for now?

https://developer.github.com/v3/pulls/#merge-a-pull-request-merge-button API can be used to explicitly set the `merge_method` to `squash`. This would work if the bot was merging the PRs. 
Humans could summon the bot to merge by either adding a label (e.g. `merge`) or with a comment (e.g. `/merge`). Note that in the case of using a comment, the bot would have to check that the commenter actually has permission to merge the PR.
