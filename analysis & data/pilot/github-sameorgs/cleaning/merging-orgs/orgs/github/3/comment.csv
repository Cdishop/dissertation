It might be a bit inconvenient to have to add `figaro exec` before every command. Plus, heroku is precompiling assets automatically, so, in order for this to work there, we'd have to override ""assets:precompile"" task to get ENV vars into webpacker/webpack. I'm not sure actually...

1. Defaults declared in the `Envfile`, i.e. `string :foo, default: ""Foo""`
2. Values declared in `.env.yml` files. Last declaration wins, overriding previous declarations of the same named variable.
3. `ENV` variables declared on the system.

With this in mind, I don't think `defaults` is a confusing method name. I'd suggest something that suggests the precedence of the files being loaded:

```ruby
source "".env.yml""
source "".env.test.yml"", if: -> { Rails.env.test? }

load "".env.yml""
load "".env.test.yml"", if: -> { Rails.env.test? }

provide "".env.yml""
provide "".env.test.yml"", if: -> { Rails.env.test? }
```

`defaults` makes it unclear what values will actually be loaded.

I think the strategy for loading really depends on if you expect value files to act like cascading stylesheets, where you can provide overrides in special conditions, then multiple DSL `source` calls makes the most sense. If you expect variables to be more mutually exclusive and independent, then I think a single YAML file with keys makes more sense. I have concerns in either situation.

- Environment files that depend on values previously declared in another environment file seems risky and unpredictable. Cascading is tricky if you don't see how things are being sourced. I'd rather see a single file that has all the overrides declared in them so there's fewer places to check to determine where something was sourced.
- A single env file that has keyed value sets is nice for seeing what's overridden where, but there's a good chance you might want to have overrides for one environment (`test`) in source control, but not from another (`production`). So in that case, I'd rather have separate env files for each environment I'd be loading.
- If you're using a single keyed environment file and passing the key in the `Envfile`, you miss out on cascaded loading unless you combine it with subsequent conditional loading, i.e.

```ruby
source "".env.yml"", key: :base
source "".env.yml"", key: :test, if: -> { Rails.env.test? }
```

I guess it all depends on what your goals are, but I think separating the idea of `defaults` and `sourced` variables is important for the clarifying the ideas in this discussion.",NA,https://api.github.com/repos/laserlemon/figaro/issues/266/comments,https://github.com/laserlemon/figaro/issues/266#issuecomment-312660960,https://api.github.com/repos/laserlemon/figaro/issues/266

To define the application environment (since Figaro will no longer be Rails-dependent), I'm adding the `environment` method to the DSL. For example:

```ruby
# env.rb
environment key: ""APP_ENV"", default: ""development""

defaults ""env.yml""

string :stripe_publishable_key
string :stripe_secret_key
decimal :price, default: ""9.99""
```

```yaml
# env.yml
stripe_publishable_key: ""pk_test_NlsxCBp2TPGWyQeHUFw4uj4L""
stripe_secret_key: ""sk_test_iHBheVvfdegliMwizMi2uiOe""

production:
  stripe_publishable_key: ""pk_live_uoExPgxfIG7bBXMAMyqHfB9b""
  stripe_secret_key: ""sk_live_KbhHZzgpzWIEsOoBOnatXUjo""
```

As for the `defaults` method naming, I hear you. I'm not sold on it either. I'm not sold on the alternatives set forth yet either. I'll keep rolling that one around.

When it comes to committing multiple default values for a given key, let's say for the `development` and `test` environments while keeping the `production` value out of source control, there are a couple of options:

1. Load multiple YAML configuration files, some committed and some not.
2. Allow environment-dependent default values in the envfile.

I'm not sure what to do about this one just yet either. I don't like the idea of multiple YAML configuration files because it's harder to track down what values are where. Plus it's more likely that something that's not supposed to get committed does get committed. Here's what option 2 might look like in practice:

```ruby
# env.rb
environment key: ""APP_ENV"", default: ""development""

defaults ""env.yml""

string :hello, default: { development: ""developer"", test: ""computer"" }
```

# Gemfile

gem ""figaro""
gem ""bonsai-elasticsearch-rails"", require: false
```

```ruby
# config/application.rb

Bundler.require(*Rails.groups)

module FooBar
  class Application < Rails::Application
    require ""bonsai-elasticsearch-rails""
  end
end
```

  # Configuration variables for JWT verification.

  #
  # JWT_PUBLIC_KEY
  #
  # JWT provider uses private key for encoding JSON Web Tokens
  # while public key is used for decoding by resources.
  #
  # For example, Barong is JWT provider, Peatio is resource accepting JWT.
  # Barong must have private key installed, Peatio must have public key installed.
  #
  # You can generate keypair by running:
  #
  #   ruby -e ""require 'openssl'; require 'base64'; OpenSSL::PKey::RSA.generate(2048).tap { |p| puts '', 'PRIVATE RSA KEY (URL-safe Base64 encoded, PEM):', '', Base64.urlsafe_encode64(p.to_pem), '', 'PUBLIC RSA KEY (URL-safe Base64 encoded, PEM):', '', Base64.urlsafe_encode64(p.public_key.to_pem) }""
  #
  # Copy the generated private key and put it's value to appropriate variable at JWT provider (for example, at Barong it will be JWT_SHARED_SECRET_KEY).
  # Copy the generated public key and put it's value to variable JWT_PUBLIC_KEY (at Peatio).
  #
  # Peatio and JWT provider should have the same keypair installed, or they would not understand each other.
  #
  # You may want to adjust key length or cipher.
  #
  # Development and test environments already don't include sample keys.
  #
  # You can generate valid JWT by running:
  #
  #   JWT.encode(payload, OpenSSL::PKey.read(Base64.urlsafe_decode64(ENCODED_PRIVATE_KEY)), ENV.fetch('JWT_ALGORITHM'))
  #
  # Replace ENCODED_PRIVATE_KEY with private key printed by previous command.
  #
  # You can decode JWT by running:
  #
  #   JWT.decode(token, OpenSSL::PKey.read(Base64.urlsafe_decode64(ENCODED_PUBLIC_KEY)), true, algorithms: [ENV.fetch('JWT_ALGORITHM')])
  #
  # To authenticate using JWT send it's value in ""Authorization"" header:

Since that work has already been done, I think a best approach to this problem is to create a `figaro:env_to_yml` command that takes in (perhaps from STDIN) a string of env variables and outputs an appliaction.yml file.  This saves us the step of having to conver `=` signs to `:` signs and such.  Ultimately the workflow would become:

```
my_app $  heroku config -s | figaro config:env_to_yml > heroku_application.yml
```

The reason I think to do it this way using pipes and such is that there are getting to be _many_ PaaS code bases out there and Figaro should probably try to be as agnostic and multi-purposed as possible.  

What do you think, and did you make any progress?  I'm thinking I might make a `figaro-config-addons` gem to add this functionality to figaro faster to allow time for review, discussion and bug fixing.  

It's important that we have a backwards and forwards compatible way (a way to set configs).  As it stands, `figaro heroku:set` automatically slurps up the application.yml file, converting it to an env format (without new line characters) and then sets the variables in heroku using herokutoolbelt CLI app (an explicit dependency).  Since Heroku is popular, this method is arguably helpful, but it isn't useful when the developer needs to import vars into dokku, Deis, etc, etc.  To this developer, an additional command `figaro config:yml_to_env` would be helpful.  I'll rewrite my PR... add tests... then see about pulling it into it's own figaro-config-addons gem and put it up for review.

> The behaviour of config vars in this case is due to the underlying Linux operating system being case sensitive. ""Behind the scenes"" config vars are just a way of managing Unix environment variables to be set on the dynos and as such, our handling of these is fairly minimal to keep them consistent with any other Linux based hosts - if we started adapting the case automatically you might find situations where it didn't work locally whereas it did on Heroku.

In your example it drops `rails_dev` for dev env and then drops `rails_dev` for test env.

The problem is that figaro respects [Twelve-Factor App](http://12factor.net), and Rails does not, it tries to be in two envs in a single run. Or does, in some way... Actually, if you set `RAILS_ENV` the things become clear.

Actually, there should not be environments in the `database.yml` when you're using figaro. Because ""environmental"" configs are defined by an explicit external set of environment variables. I'm hardly sure that Rails would like this.

Outside of that possibility, I'm at a loss. I'm going to close this but feel free to add more diagnostic information here and I'll try to help if I can. It would obviously help if we could identify what's happening in your workflow when the file disappears.

It may help if you were to make sure that `application.yml` is not checked in to version control in _any_ of your branches. If it is, switching between two branches where it is/isn't checked in could cause this behavior. To be clear, `application.yml` should never be committed to any branch.

Sure, my app is open sourced: https://github.com/rhannequin/funky-starter-plus-plus/tree/feature/unicorn. The exception is throwed from [`config/initializers/devise.rb`](https://github.com/rhannequin/funky-starter-plus-plus/blob/feature/unicorn/config/initializers/devise.rb#L7), where `ENV['DEVISE_SECRET_KEY']` is supposed to be defined from [`config/application.yml`](https://github.com/rhannequin/funky-starter-plus-plus/blob/feature/unicorn/config/application.example.yml#L34) (here example file). I found that `ENV` was also empty of my values (only usual environment variables but not from Figaro) in [`config/application.rb`](https://github.com/rhannequin/funky-starter-plus-plus/blob/feature/unicorn/config/application.rb). And as I said, when I replaced the `ENV` value in [`config/initializers/devise.rb`](https://github.com/rhannequin/funky-starter-plus-plus/blob/feature/unicorn/config/initializers/devise.rb#L7) to avoid the exception, my app launched properly and `ENV` was full of values.

This issue happens only on my web server after deploying with Capistrano, `config/application.yml` file is a symbolic link from the shared directory (and I checked, the issue is not from the symbolic link).

The next issue I had is the main reason I'm writting this comment. **If, like me, you decide to start your database password with an '!', things get really fun.** if you only use one set of quotes and try to embed from config/application.yml to config/database.yml

in application.yml
`
DB_PASS: ""!asdfadsf""
`

in database.yml
`
password: <%= ENV['DB_PASS'] %>
`

The quotes you put around DB_PASS in config/application.yml get stripped away and your left with

`
password: !ajdkfasdfdf
`

This is not what we want because starting a yaml variable with an '!' creates a yaml tag, http://www.yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#id2761292, and that will not get properly feed into your database.

In order to get around this issue, we have to nest double quotes inside single quotes to ensure there are still quotes around the value when it is parsed from database.yml.

config/application.yml
`
password: '""!adsfadsfadsf""'
`

 I hope this saves someone time in the future.

TL;DR
If your password begins with an '!', you must double quote it.
`
DB_PASS: '""!asdklfadjslfk""'

Here's the repo: https://github.com/fny/figaro_fail/commits/master

With a vanilla Rails 4.2 app (`rails new figaro_fail`) and a basic Figaro setup (say we've got a config key ""hello: howdy""), the following breaks upon running the app: https://github.com/fny/figaro_fail/commit/6f738b47567dc23a5bacccad8a164ee39f468225

And it's easily fixed by adding this line:

My test works because this is the code I test to ensure configuration is available immediately following application inheritance:

``` ruby
module Example
  class Application < Rails::Application
    config.foo = ENV[""foo""]
  end
end
```

This works. I'll get to why.

On the other hand, this code will not work:

``` ruby
module Example
  class Application < Rails::Application
    puts ENV[""foo""]
  end
end
```

The reason the first example works and the second doesn't is because the `before_configuration` hook (the earliest hook available) that Figaro ties into doesn't run until the new _instance_ of the `Example::Application` is initialized. Initializing the singleton application instance happens when the `instance` method is called on the `Example::Application` class. It just so happens that the `config` class method [delegates to `instance`](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/v4.2.1/railties/lib/rails/railtie/configurable.rb#L9).

So the fact that my example evaluates `config` before it evaluates `ENV[""foo""]` avoids the issue by initializing the instance _just_ in time. In your example, by the time you evaluate `ENV[""foo""]`, the `instance` has yet to be initialized.

Off the top of my head, I'm not sure how to get around this, outside of the `Figaro.load` workaround you've already come up with. Thoughts?

The problem you stated is exactly correct, the `before_configuration` hook is actually never run until `config` is called for the first time, which lazily loads a config instance. So, this actually works too:

``` ruby
module Example
  class Application < Rails::Application
    config
    puts ENV[""foo""]
  end
end
```

I'd say the smartest thing to do would be to add a note in the documentation and submit an issue about the regression to Rails.

The `figaro install` allows you to pass in the path, e.g `figaro install -p config/passport.yml` - but this only creates the file, and appends it to the git ignore. But then the gem will still look for the file at `config/application.yml`.

This works when used in an initializer:

``` ruby
# config/initializers/figaro.rb
Figaro.application.path = Rails.root.join('config', 'passport.yml')
Figaro.load

Next, I think this feature would be more useful if the user could specify _any_ path on the server, not just a path within `Rails.root`. But if that's the case, how would one easily specify a relative path within `Rails.root`? Would it even be necessary to supply a relative path, or will most (all?) deployment setups at least symlink the deployment to a predictable location such as `/app/foobarapp/current` so that an absolute path would suffice?

As for your concern. Joining an absolute path with `Rails.root` will return the absolute path. There's already a test for this in the [figaro/rails/application_spec.rb](https://github.com/zeeraw/figaro/blob/3f99353a3f29422e284533ca3b7df3f09b5e2d33/spec/figaro/rails/application_spec.rb#L31)

As for my rationale. I ran in to issues and came up with this feature trying to support defaults for different environments on different platforms in development.

For OS X defaults I would like something like this:

``` yaml
# config/application.osx+brew.yml
development: &defaults
  database_url: postgres://app@localhost:5432/dev?template=template0&pool=5&encoding=unicode
  redis_url: redis://localhost:6379/0
test:
  <<: *defaults
  database_url: postgres://app@localhost:5432/test?template=template0&pool=5&encoding=unicode
  redis_url: redis://localhost:6379/0
```

While something like `docker` + `fig` gives me `/etc/hosts` records in my application container using dockers internal network to communicate with the dependent service containers. In this case it would be cool if my defaults looked something like this:

``` yaml
# config/application.fig+docker.yml
development: &defaults
  database_url: postgres://app@postgres:5432/dev?template=template0&pool=5&encoding=unicode
  redis_url: redis://redis:6379/0
test:
  <<: *defaults
  database_url: postgres://app@postgres:5432/test?template=template0&pool=5&encoding=unicode
  redis_url: redis://redis:6379/0

The idea is that this warning may very well be telling you something that you don't know. Take this scenario:

A developer deploys his or her application to production with an `application.yml` file. The configuration file contains a key named `foo`. If the production server's `ENV` already has a `foo` key, the `foo` value from `application.yml` will be ignored. It's very possible that the developer was unaware that the server already had this `ENV` variable set. This is most common with generic key naming like `USER`.

This situation can be (and has been) very confusing for developers in the past because they can't readily see why the value in `application.yml` would not be respected.

Upon further thought, it seems as though you'd only get this warning if you have `ENV` variables set on Heroku _and_ have an `application.yml` as well. Can you confirm that that's the case? If so, it's advised to use either one approach or the other rather than both at once.

Please let me know if you have any questions about all of that :point_up:. I hope I'm making things clearer rather than muddying the waters!

I have another required variables which I'm setting defaults on application.yml.example. So for me I should use application.yml(which is copied from .yml.example) and override just the database and maybe some another CI related settings. And when you look at the CI logs, you're seeing the Warnings everywhere.

suppress is false, then they could see the warnings even in CI. This is
just my suggestion.

I'd like to be consistent with Figaro's use of `application.yml` in part to avoid as much breakage as possible during an upgrade to Figaro 1.0. Your other naming suggestions are great but I'm prioritizing consistency.

As for settingslogic using `application.yml` as an example file, those sorts of decisions are outside of my control so it's a slippery slope attempting to work around them.

I'm new to `config_for` but as I understand it, it will be mostly used for configuring external services. To use Rails built-in structure for app configuration, you'd probably use `secrets.yml`.

Thanks again for your suggestions. They're great but I'm prioritizing consistency for the time being.

I'll often have multiple rails projects on the same machine, but in different directories.  Some of them will use the same env keys, but with different values.  Rather than having to unpleasantly manage my actual environment variables, I depend on application.yml in an individual app directory to make every thing right.
An example: each app has FACEBOOK_APP_ID, etc, but unique values

I didn't see a very elegant approach to make an override.  I chose an env var FIGARO_OVERRIDE == ""true"".  When set, the skip function will always return false.

I thought about an initializer or class variable, but wasn't sure when that would execute vs figaro (eg would that be too late in the app startup process?)

Have you taken a look already? Did you see a way to solve the problem?

My last attempt was these changes: https://github.com/sealocal/figaro/commits/convert_to_string

`$ rake spec` breaks some tests:

``` console
Finished in 16.21 seconds (files took 0.41252 seconds to load)
89 examples, 5 failures

Failed examples:

rspec ./spec/figaro/application_spec.rb:245 # Figaro::Application#load allows nil values
rspec ./spec/figaro/application_spec.rb:197 # Figaro::Application#load merges values into ENV
rspec ./spec/figaro/application_spec.rb:237 # Figaro::Application#load warns when a value isn't a string

rspec ./spec/figaro/application_spec.rb:217 # Figaro::Application#load sets keys that have already been set internally
```

I believe the intention of the tests is covered by my changes, but I am hesitant to modify specs. For example, if I boot the app in `rails console`, then I do see a warning when a value isn't a string.

Of course, there may be a better approach. Thoughts?

If we only Spring.watch `application.yml` if a `config/spring.rb` exists, we would be affecting people who have customized Spring in this particular project.

If we're trying to target all people who use spring, we could search through their gemfile to see if the spring gem was in there, affecting anyone who had spring, regardless of whether or not they had configured it yet.

- A new gem just for this configuration seems over-the-top. 
- Generating config/spring.rb would insert a useless file in Rails < 4.1, or in applications that don't use Rails.  This seems like bad behavior for an install script.
- Ignoring Spring completely seems bad. Figaro should play as nice as possible with Rails.
- Passing in options to the install script would be a more viable option if the architecture were already in place, but setting up all that for a single options seems like overkill.  If another need to pass in options come up, then perhaps this would be a good move.  

I'm leaning towards: 
- Inserting a note about Spring configuration within the docs (I would probably have to make a new section, as the docs about the install command don't seem to be in `README.md` anymore?)
- If the application already has a spring.rb file, then the install command does any relevant configuration.

If Figaro is moving towards framework independence, then it shouldn't assume Spring's existence (as far as I know that assumption only holds for Rails > 4.1)

As far as spring goes: the default behavior should not assume the existence of Spring (unless config/spring.rb exists).  A user could pass in -s or --spring to have it configure spring for them.

I agree that documentation is important for Figaro configuration. This is something I haven't communicated well enough in the past or even now after rewriting the readme. Here's the pattern I've used:

I commit a `config/application.example.yml` file to the repo with `nil` values. Each key or group of keys that warrant explanation get a block of comments above.

``` yaml
# Pusher: realtime messaging
#
# Your Pusher app_id, key and secret are all application-specific. You can sign
# up for a free ""sandbox"" account and create a new application at:
#
#   https://app.pusher.com
#
pusher_app_id: ~
pusher_key: ~
pusher_secret: ~

# Stripe: payment processing
#
# You can sign up at Stripe for free and your credentials can be found at:
#
#   https://manage.stripe.com/account/apikeys
#
# Be sure to us the appropriate key pair (test vs. live)!
#
stripe_api_key: ~
stripe_publishable_key: ~
```

There are a few benefits to this approach:
1. YAML has great support for comments. These are easily written and read. Nicely formatted comments inside the `require` method call would require using heredocs. Plus, semantically, these really are comments that we're discussing.
2. Optional configuration keys get the same love when it comes to documentation as their required counterparts.
3. Configuration keys often travel in packs. Pusher has a few. Stripe has a couple. Rather than documenting each key individually, groups of keys can be documented at once without being redundant.

So far, we've had very little trouble using Figaro with this convention. The problems we did have were due to not having a way to require keys during boot time to alert a developer to their absence. The `require` method solves that for us now, as we simply hop over to the example file.

I agree with you that some sort of `figaro status` command like you describe would be pretty great, but the code cleverness that may be required to get there using an example file might not be worth it, not to mention the formalization of one example file convention.

I have had thoughts about expanding the ability of the `require` method to accept a hash as well, but my take is intended to be correctional rather than instructive.

``` ruby
Figaro.require(
  ""pusher_app_id"" => /\A\d+\z/,
  ""pusher_key"" => /\A[0-9a-f]{20}\z/,
  ""pusher_secret"" => /\A[0-9a-f]{20}\z/,
  ""stripe_api_key"" => /\Ask_(test|live)_[0-9a-zA-Z]{24}\z/,
  ""stripe_publishable_key"" => /\Apk_(test|live)_[0-9a-zA-Z]{24}\z/
)
```

This may actually make more sense as a separate `validate` method and would be used to prevent bungled values. Validation could still be run (allowing `nil`) on optional configuration keys. Matching would use either the `===` or `=~` method so a custom validator could also be used in place of any of the regular expressions.

Thoughts?

- When reporting an issue:
  1. Do a small search on the issues tracker before submitting your issue to see if it was already reported / fixed.
  2. The more information you give, the easier it will be to track down the issue and fix it.
  3. Include Ruby, Rails and Figaro versions. Here's a little table to help you out:

```
|        | Version |
| ------ |---------|
| Ruby   | 2.1.1   |
| Rails  | 4.1.0   |
| Figaro | 1.0.0   |

This will render as:

  - Link to [these guidelines](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html) for writing commit messages. This is the de facto standard, and I see links to it all the time.
  - Maybe reference the branch where pull requests should be sent to? I'd say most libraries use master by default (and GitHub does send pull requests to master by default) but I remember that that threw me off the first time I sent a pull request.
  - Mention tests?

I could do an alphabet hack to make it run as the first initializer, but application.rb seems more natural for initializer dependencies.

It works fine with the workaround above anyway.

I used to use nested config structures. We used our own internal gem that rolled yaml files such as your example into a nested structure of OpenStructs, deep-merging the default cofiguration with environment overrides that could also be nested.

Over time however I came to view this as anti-productive. In large apps the configuration files actually started to become too big to navigate a nested structure quickly. Also, when I was adding a new setting it was not always clear where in the structure it belonged so I would spend a little bit of time figuring it out, using up some of my decision-making-energy uselessly. 

Now I view the flat configuration file as more productive.

I'm assuming eventually secrets.yml will incorporate some of the Figaro

You could perhaps allow Figaro to point at secrets through a config option

At one point I had added hash style access to `Figaro.env` but it would only duplicate behavior of ENV so I don't see it as necessary. There's nothing wrong with just using ENV if you like hash access.

As far as _case-insensitive_ hash access, I think it's too surprising. The only reason the current `Figaro.env` proxy allows case-insensitive access now is so that uppercase ENV values would not require uppercase method calls.

In 0.7, `Figaro.env` is kind of a mutt. It represents a hash of the Figaro configuration values in `application.yml` but it also passes method calls through to ENV. In your case, `Figaro.env.to_h` is giving you the values that Figaro found in `application.yml`, but anything that actually looks into ENV will find your overridden value instead.

The forthcoming 1.0 release no longer gives `Figaro.env` a dual purpose. It will serve only to fall through to ENV with convenient method style access. Access to Figaro's configuration as it's found in `application.yml` will be available at `Figaro.application.configuration`.

I hope that clears it up. If you're looking for the values actually set to ENV, I recommend just using ENV directly.

I definitely agree with your arguments. I never believed this new feature to be a Figaro killer (just think of that cute mascot!). In fact, Figaro remains a strong gem choice because:
- Rails' approach does not use ENV variables.
- The `secrets.yml` file isn't automatically added to `.gitignore` (and it shouldn't, since clueless developers would deploy their apps to production without that file).

So at this point, I don't think Figaro really needs to change for Rails 4.1 . I, for one, will keep using Figaro.

We've put some workflow around the rake tasks (e.g., I have some tasks that ensure we have decrypted our latest application.yml prior to figaro running), and without that sort of extensibility, Figaro is of limited use to us.

I realize that I may be one of the few people who are actively using the fact that Figaro initializes as rake tasks right now, but there's a lot of power in being integrated into something that already manages dependencies for you.

We've done a couple of things in a local `lib/tasks/figaro.rake`:

``` ruby
task 'figaro:heroku' => 'config:decrypt' # This decrypts our application.yml.gpg
task 'figaro:heroku' => 'figaro:app'

namespace :figaro do
  task :app, [ :app ] do |_, args|
    %w(raw yaml).each { |var|
      Figaro.instance_variable_set(:""@#{var}"", nil)
    }
    $heroku_app = args[:app]
  end
end
```

The first added dependency (`config:decrypt`) is the main piece we can't live without that doing with Thor makes difficult. We want to force a decryption of our `application.yml.gpg` prior to pushing to heroku.

The second (`figaro:app`) is something that I think that Figaro could do as well, but I haven't made the changes for that locally (it would require bigger changes to the code and a local version of the Figaro gem; I was able to implement the diff/show capabilities inline to our `lib/tasks/figaro.rake` file. We use it like:

``` yaml
staging-app-1: &staging-app-1
  …

staging-app-2: &staging-app-2
  …

staging: &staging
  <<: *<%= $heroku_app || 'staging-app-1' %>
  …
```

This lets us have multiple staging environments without changing the Rails environment code (it still uses `staging`, but incorporates either `staging-app-1` or `staging-app-2` as provided, defaulting to `staging-app-1`). The caching of `@raw` and `@yaml` in Figaro is a problem here as you've already initialized Figaro to `development` by running `rake` at all—but clearing those values makes it work perfectly (and implementing the diff/show capabilities showed me that I needed to do that, because the diffs were much larger than they should have been).

(This is definitely advanced YAML, but once you understand it, it's pretty damned amazing.)

@jfelchner you should definitely look at the ref/deref capabilities of YAML and highlight them in [chamber](https://github.com/m5rk/chamber) documentation the way that I've shown above.

The first being that configuration setting are likely to be used inside other initializers so it would have to be a numbered initializer (yuk!) to ensure it happened first. Also by the time the initializers run `Figaro.load` has already been called so I'd need to call it again to get the new settings.

Example:

`config/initializers/00_figaro.rb`

``` ruby
Figaro.application.path = ENV[""FIGARO_CONFIG""] || Figaro.application.path
Figaro.load
```

My specific use case is being able to develop packaged applications that provide a `/etc/init.d/someapp` with a matching `/etc/someapp/application.yml` config file. The init script would set the FIGARO_CONFIG environment variable accordingly. However local development would still use the default config/application.yml file.

Perhaps there is a better way...

- no need have ENV var that might collide with some of the ENVs used by adapters, etc.
- keeps the convention that there's only one file (application.yml) that is being used by figaro gem

### Cons:
- need separate rules in config automation systems (i.e. Chef, Puppet) - might be cumbersome to set-up
- reliance on a filename convention is bad because it might collide with other gems
- some deployment systems might require re-running config after the deploy (imagine deploying with Capistrano that will create a new dir to store latest version of the app, but you use Puppet for the config -> You will have to re-run Puppet config after each deploy for no reason) -- @jbussdieker might have a few good points here

I don't think your statement justifies the argument against having highly customizable configuration library. To me it looks a like sacrifice worth making. Especially that there aren't any known additional adapters (apart from the built-in Rails one) that would have to use `ENV[""FIGARO_PATH""]` and couldn't use something else.

Out of all the libraries out there figaro made most sense to us. The only obstacle was the need for storing config in application.yml in the app's folder. So we forked it 5 months ago and it worked like a charm. Maybe our use case was too specific to justify the code change, but on the other hand I don't see the need to overthink the problem: it's a very lightweight library, not Rails.

This is a known issue. We use Rails' standard hooks to initialize Figaro before Rails initializes. Unfortunately, this hook apparently occurs after `database.yml` is read. Trying to circumvent the standard hooks and tie into Rails' initialization elsewhere introduces a host of new problems and makes it very difficult to account for every situation in which the Rails environment is loaded.

I'm afraid this falls into the ""won't fix"" bucket until Rails provides a better (and supported) hook that Figaro can tie into. In my apps, I Git-ignore `database.yml` like I ignore `application.yml`. Not ideal, but it seems like the best we can do for now.

I'm not sure if a small app would really capture how this app is setup. It's not massive but it is slightly unusual.

Here's some items of interest: I'm using Rails 3.2.13 with postgres. Fairly normal. I'm using Unicorn (in dev and production) with `preload_app true`. This means that in my after_fork handler I'm calling `ActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection`. Could this really be reloading the database.yml? I'd be surprised.

Additionally, I'm using the Apartment gem to switch postgres schemas based on the subdomain, which would also be changing the AR connection.

Do you know where in Rails database.yml gets loaded?

Figaro hooks into [`config.before_configuration`](https://github.com/laserlemon/figaro/blob/master/lib/figaro/railtie.rb#L6) but, I'm wondering, could Figaro be an initializer instead? Then you can specify that it should load before ""active_record.initialize_database""?

So, I did it: https://github.com/ideasasylum/figaro/commit/1eeb7a95e14f814401a5ee8123fe15b85a3a6e49

You can try this fork with `gem ""figaro"", git: 'https://github.com/ideasasylum/figaro.git'`. And if works then it can be pulled in.

And if you want to explore the Rails/Figaro/database initialisation process… [Here's a gist of a pry session](https://gist.github.com/ideasasylum/6328360#file-pry-rb-L252) I used to verify that the Figaro initializer was being loaded before the activerecord database initialization

Another option is to fail fast if the environment can't be determined, since I presume that would be a result of poor network conditions or a problem with the API.

All `ENV` values must be strings.

By putting an array in `application.yml`, you're effectively setting your configuration value to the result of `Array#to_s` (which has been known to change its behavior between Ruby versions).

Configuration values should be explicit. So if you want your roles' value to be the exact string: `[admin, user, VIP]`, your YAML should read:

ADMIN_NAME: ""Danny Van Hoof""

With a standard `database.yml`, as the one generated by `rails new app_name`, I think this problem does not appear.

However, I just had a similar problem on a different subject: I define the S3 bucket I use for [CarrierWave](https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave) in `config/initializers/carrier_wave.rb`. If I use the figaro way of defining an environment specific configuration, my test are run against my development bucket.

Apparently (at least with Rails 3.2), when you run `rake test`, the code in initializers is executed twice(!), the first time with `Rails.env == 'development'`, and the second time with `Rails.env == 'test'`. Both times Figaro gives the development value.

I guess this is a rather serious issue as it can lead to data loss. **I would recommend to make an immediate update to  `README.md`, mentionning that the environment specific configuration feature should not be used with `test` environment as it does not ensure (because of Rails) that default or development value is not used.**

I'm trying to think out and design a solution. We need (really want) Figaro to initialize itself automatically when loaded in the context of a Rails application, including a Rails application in development.

The process of running your tests is apparently booting your Rails application in development and _then_ switching `Rails.env` to `""test""`. Right off the bat, that seems strange to me and I don't experience that behavior as I mostly use RSpec and my `spec_helper.rb` boots Rails _after_ I set `ENV[""RAILS_ENV""]`.

But short of sequencing those steps differently, I wonder if a method like `Figaro.setup`, that you can run where/when you need to, might do the trick.

If not, then I feel like there might be some strange database configuration going on here. What does your `database.yml` look like? And your `application.yml`? While we're at it: your `test_helper.rb` too. Could you throw these into a Gist and add the link here? Of course, please exclude any sensitive information!

Thanks for the quick reply! I use RSpec as well, and as @eric-smartlove pointed out, this only happens when I run my tests using `rake spec`. If I execute the suite with `rspec` or `guard`, it runs fine. The reason I sometimes use `rake spec` is just that I'm used to it from other non-rspec projects.

For me it is weird as well that the env gets set to development during tests... Maybe this is a `rake` issue?

I dropped `figaro` from my Gemfile and now I'm manually loading application.yml into the environment instead, so this is not urgent for me.

Seems like it's a configuration-loading-sequence issue. It's possible that Figaro could prepend a task onto one (or more) of the Active Record rake tasks like `:load_config`, but that's just a hunch at the moment.

It does seem as though Figaro is loaded some time before `database.yml` is evaluated but that `Rails.env` hasn't yet been set to `""test""`. It could have to do with `rspec-rails` automatically prepending the `db:test:prepare` task before `rake spec`.

I don't have a lot of time to look into it at the moment, but please feel free to look into a solution and submit a pull request. Thank you again for the report and information.

Figaro's configuration ties into Rails' initialization process in a very standard way that apparently will not occur before the database is configured and connected. Monkey-patching Rails to make this work automatically will not be very maintainable across the multiple versions of Rails that Figaro works with, and it strays from Figaro's credo of simplicity.

That said, there is still a lot about the Rails and Active Record initialization process that I don't fully understand and there may still be an elegant and reliable way to solve this issue. If that ends up being the case, I would gladly merge a simple pull request.

I hope that helps explain the situation and please do feel free to investigate!

Part of that effort is to make Figaro more easily extensible so that it could be used in other Ruby frameworks down the road. I'm also interested in revamping the rake tasks.

As it is now, rake tasks are clumsy when it comes to passing arguments. I'm considering using Thor tasks instead.

``` bash
figaro heroku:push --environment=staging

But with Thor, I'm having a hard time writing namespaces tasks like this, and there's the issue of loading the Rails environment first (or avoiding the need). Eventually, I'd like to see a few tasks:

``` bash
figaro heroku:push # Push Figaro configuration up to Heroku
figaro heroku:pull # Pull configuration down from Heroku into Figaro
figaro travis:encrypt # Encrypt Figaro configuration to Travis configuration

However I like the Idea of ENV-vars overwriting the ones from application.yml. In my opinion precedence should be like this:

```
(default value <) application.yml < ENV
```

If Figaro then overwrites with values from ENV but **only if it's not an empty string** you can still do `UNWANTED_VAR= rails server` to get rid of unwanted vars in your ENV.

It gives 'production' by default (e.g., on my test Heroku instance). So people can include environment variable settings that differ between production and development, for instance.

Someone might set this differently, as in `heroku config:set RAILS_ENV=something`. Trying this, I received 'something' back (correctly) from `heroku run ""echo \$RAILS_ENV""`.

Some people may be using Heroku as their (only) development box, especially following (some) tutorials. It's certainly feasible to do this.

But those people (in their config/application.yml) wouldn't give any environment variable settings for Heroku that differ by Rails environment (such as between production and development), right?. So, although Heroku will report 'production', they can still develop on it.

The hardest part might be writing a test for this that monitors Heroku's actual behavior!

1. Access a (squeeze, maybe later) Debian system, either by:

a. Using the box of someone you know;
b. Installing Debian or Ubuntu on a box; or
c. Using a fresh Amazon instance, pre-loaded with Debian or Ubuntu.
1. Install the Heroku toolbelt on it, per the Heroku site's instructions for Debian.
2. `mkdir some-directory; cd some-directory`
3. `rails new .`
4. Add the Figaro gem to Gemfile
5. `bundle install`
6. `heroku create`
7. `bundle exec figaro:heroku`

EDIT: obviously, step 8 should be: `bundle exec rake figaro:heroku`

I tried another Debian computer, and it failed the same way. However, it only fails when the Ruby version is specified in Gemfile. (But sometimes that's necessary.)

As you may know, on Heroku, some apps must specify Ruby 1.9.3 in Gemfile, since (at present) Heroku's default is Ruby 1.9.2. For instance, the current mongoid gem fails without it.

I understand that YAML has far more features than Figaro needs and this makes it problematic. For example, many bugfixes are about escaping values which are special in YAML. But Rails is an opinionated framework and they have chosen YAML for configuration needs. It is a convention. As long as `figaro.gemspec` includes line `gem.add_dependency ""rails""`, YAML should be supported. And I see no any big win in adding support for an additional format which gives no real advantages. After all, those are nearly flat, clean-looking configs which are seldom edited.

If someone has very custom needs in configuration format and really cares about that, then most probably Figaro is not for him for other reasons too. It isn't well suited for storing binaries, data structures and so on. He'll write his own solution from scratch.

Because of the nature of this attack (remote execution), the attacker could have just as easily inspected `ENV` and thrown that into Pastie. Your app processes need access to your configuration, so if an attacker has access to those processes, it really doesn't matter how you're storing your configs.

If the concern were some vulnerability giving an attacker access to the filesystem rather than the Ruby process, then yes, Figaro's `application.yml` file would be a less secure option.

That said, what's great about Figaro is that if you prefer to throw your configs into your server's `ENV` rather than `application.yml`, that'll work perfectly fine.

I hope that makes sense and maybe even helps. Feel free to continue the conversation here, although I will close the issue.

That did the trick and the rake now completes.  Can't believe 2 spaces was the issue, I feel a bit of a numpty.

Now however I have another issue.  Heroku is not picking up the production set of values, it's using the default values.  I checked previous issues and can see code that looks at the RAILS_ENV variable.  Which strangely returned blank.  I set the value to 'production' and re-ran the rake command.  No change, still the default values are being used.

I'm using foreman and slanger in a project. When I boot up slanger, I need to pass in variables. Those same variables need to be in the `application.yml` file so that Pusher can actually connect to the correct server.

web:      bundle exec rails server puma -p $PORT -e $RACK_ENV
worker:   bundle exec sidekiq -c 100
slanger:  bundle exec slanger --app_id $PUSHER_APP_ID --app_key $PUSHER_KEY --secret $PUSHER_SECRET

  PUSHER_APP_ID: <%= ENV['PUSHER_APP_ID'] %>
  PUSHER_KEY: <%= ENV['PUSHER_KEY'] %>

My example application currently uses `sqlite3` - it's a noddy little application. Convention is that `sqlite3` files are found in `db/`:

```
$ ls -1 db/*.sqlite3
db/development.sqlite3
db/production.sqlite3
db/test.sqlite3
```

Now I currently deploy my application to [OpenShift](https://openshift.redhat.com). But OpenShift's deployment blows away the entire repo every time you `git push`. Files that must persist need be stored in `$OPENSHIFT_DATA_DIR` which is outside the repo tree.

In order to not have OpenShift specific `ENV['OPENSHIFT_XYZ']` references kicking around my code, the pattern I was hoping to use has the following structure:

``` yaml
# config/application.yml

PRODUCTION_DATABASE_DIR: <%= ENV['OPENSHIFT_DATA_DIR'] %>
```

``` yaml
# config/database.yml

production:
  adapter: sqlite3
  pool: 5
  timeout: 5000
  database: <%= ENV['PRODUCTION_DATABASE_DIR'] %>/production.sqlite3
```

This way, if I ever move to Heroku or CloudFoundry, the number of required changes is limited to 1 file (theoretically at least... there might well be other tweaks required).

Does this make sense? 

Or can someone suggest an alternative?

Incidentally, @laserlemon I'm a big fan of `figaro` - it's helped to [tidy up my projects no end](http://blog.myitcv.org.uk/2013/03/10/using-figaro-and-bash-for-a-smoother-development-config-environment.html)

My use case is using Pow with VMs.  We have several apps that work together, and need to know each other's URLs.  We put the URLs to the other applications in application.yml so that they become part of the environment.  I understand that this is not really how the library was intended to be used, but it's a nice library and we like the convenience of having everything in one place (several URLs from external vendors do have the credentials in the URL).

To finish how we use it, we commit an encrypted version of application.yml, so that the credentials are available to every member on the team (closed source project).  It's not a perfect system, but it works pretty well.  

At any rate, I am doing some script magic in .powrc to export a variable that lets me know if these apps should talk to each other at app.dev or at app.ip_adddress.xip.io.  (You use the latter form when hitting them from a VM).

If I could do ERB exansion, I could put a simple expression like:

Thanks for writing! I love the idea of loading in environment specific configs. I only have a couple concerns:

Determining the environment. While Figaro is currently built for Rails apps, there's nothing keeping it from being used for any old Rack app. This issue is certainly able to be overcome.

Next up: the difference between Figaro and Settingslogic is that Figaro's configs are _flat_. By that, I mean they'll be loaded into `ENV` which is just a collection of key/value pairs. Figaro doesn't support nested configs. So mashing the environment-specific configs into the top-level may be tricky. For instance:

``` yaml
airbrake_api_key: 932685345ee738a742210be4c2223864
development:
  host: example.local
production:
  host: example.com
```

In development, the mashed config would look something like:

``` yaml

airbrake_api_key: 932685345ee738a742210be4c2223864
host: example.local
production:
  host: example.com
```

Now that I'm writing this, I suppose Figaro could just ignore hash or array values post-mash.

Please feel free to take a stab at this. Just please don't be offended if I tweak for style! :smile: Otherwise, I can give it a shot when I'm able. Thanks again for the suggestion!

I guess a rather **simple** way to handle it, is any key that contains a hash would have to match the ENV (however you decide to try and detect that), and then would be deep merged on top of the top level hash.

For example:

``` yaml
airbrake_api_key: 932685345ee738a742210be4c2223864
development:
  host: example.local
production:
  host: example.com
```

would become, in 'production':

``` yaml
airbrake_api_key: 932685345ee738a742210be4c2223864
host: example.com
```

but in enviroment 'foo' would be

``` yaml
airbrake_api_key: 932685345ee738a742210be4c2223864

```

EDIT: realized this is exactly what you said.  Brain moving slowly today.  If I take a stab, it would work like the above.

I realize that might not be the most magical solution, but it would work to suite my needs :P

First, _no tests_! Actually, that's what's keeping me from putting out my own work on this. I'm having a hard time writing solid, real-world tests for it.

Secondly, I'm not sure yet if it would be better to call `system` or use backticks rather than calling `Heroku::CLI` methods directly. In that case, I'd want to conditionally add the rake task based on `defined?(Heroku)`. Thoughts?

I just had this task around that I use sometimes and think it would be cool to have this kind of feature..

``` cucumber
Given I add ""heroku"" as a dependency
And I bundle
And I run ""bundle exec heroku apps:create""
And I create ""config/application.yml"" with:
  """"""
  HELLO: world
  """"""
When I run ""bundle exec rake figaro:heroku""
Then the output should be:
  """"""
  Adding config vars and restarting app... done, v1
    HELLO => world
  """"""
```

This is how I started trying to test it and I planned on stubbing requests to the Heroku API using `webmock` but because the `heroku apps:create` call and the rake task are outside of the currently running Cucumber process, those stubbed requests are lost. :-1:

What I like about your approach is that it simply defers to a Heroku command and so it's much easier to assert that the proper command is run. My way, I could assert that the proper Heroku::CLI method is called with the proper arguments, but that is far more likely to change than the forward-facing interface.

Either way, without being able to access stubbed requests in the subprocesses that are fired up in the Cucumber context, this is feeling much more like a spec addition than a scenario.

Since addFilesToGist works but uploadFileToGist does not I compared their code.  The obvious difference is that add is just using readFile while update is using readFileSync.  Making a guess there is an issue with the blocking synchronous read I modified uploadFileToGist to use just readFile, built a new .vsix and tested it.  The upload works succesfully with my change.

Would it be sufficient to simply say that you want a front-matter title as well when generating new daily pages? Or would you want to be able to specify the entire front-matter block? I just ask because I could probably add a setting to allow generating a front-matter section for new page, that simply auto-generated the title based on the date.

This would make it practically frictionless to add new posts for my particular use case.

It would also be good to have a more generic solution, but this may be a bit more complex.

For instance, [Docusaurus's example post](https://docusaurus.io/docs/blog#adding-posts) has 9 separate fields:

```md
---
title: Welcome Docusaurus v2
author: Joel Marcey

description: This is my first post on Docusaurus 2.

hide_table_of_contents: false
---
```

Granted, it would be convenient to have certain static fields like `author`, `author_url`, `author_image_url`, and `hide_table_of_contents` automatically filled out for you when making a new post.

The generic solution would probably be more valuable to users that are making posts for a website with multiple writers or if there were repeating metadata when making new posts.

But again, it would be great to have the non-generic solution as well.",NA,https://api.github.com/repos/lostintangent/gistpad/issues/217/comments,https://github.com/lostintangent/gistpad/issues/217#issuecomment-808438484,https://api.github.com/repos/lostintangent/gistpad/issues/217

Then, whenever you create a new daily page, it would auto-populate the file with the contents from that template file.

In order to parameterize it, the template could support mustache placeholders (e.g. `{{foo}}`) that would be rendered properly whenever a page was created from it. To start, we could support a `{{title}}` placeholder, but we could add more over time. The nice thing about this solution, is that it would allow you to define the front-matter you want, but would also be quite a bit more flexible (and also interoperable with other note-taking solutions). It would also be similar to how GitHub enables issue/PR templates. Thoughts?

There's actually already a protocol handler for opening a repo, though it needs to be enhanced in order to make this E2E truly shine.

If you want this level of control over your gists, would it make sense to just clone them locally and make commits manually? If you right-click a gist, there's an option to clone it. I added that as a fallback for situations where folks needed more flexibility than GistPad could provide 👍

The commit-on-save behavior is one of the core reasons I built GistPad, so I'd love to discuss alternatives to adding a commit step. I'm still planning to expose revision history into the extension, at which point, I'd prefer to leave the commit-on-save as-is, and simply make it easier to view diffs and then revert then if necessary.

I submitted a pull request that fixes this for me on Windows 10. If someone hasn't tried my PR on Ubuntu by the time I am free later, I can set up a machine to try it.

---
I seem to be having the same issue on v1.46.0, Windows 10.

I didn't have any of the other extensions enabled that you mentioned, but it seems like basically all my extensions stop do anything, for the most part, once GistPad starts. Its like there is something synchronous being done that never completes.
- Git Source Control doesn't finish loading.
- None of the intellisense seems works.
- If I hover anything in the editor, such as a function, that shows comments or some other information, it just shows 'Loading...'.
- Can't save without canceling any saveOnComplete actions, because none of them can complete.

To see if it was just interrupting the startup, I started VSCode with GistPad disabled and made sure the problems I listed above were working as I expected. Then I enabled GistPad without restarting and the problems started. So, git stopped detecting any changes, intellisense stopped providing any code completion, anything I hovered in the editor just shows 'Loading...', etc.

I don't know how far the initialization gets, but it doesn't log in. None of the GistPad buttons or commands seem to do or log anything that I can see.

My problem seems to be more about the `GIT_ASKPASS` tool. It looks like the `GIT_ASKPASS` environment var isn't correctly set to use VSCode and instead is getting hung waiting for the username/password prompt to be inputed.

First I wrote a small nodejs script to see if `execSync` and `execFileSync` were using the same Git.
```js
const { execSync, execFileSync } = require('child_process')

console.log('execFileSync: where git')
console.log(execFileSync('where', ['git'], { encoding: 'utf8' }))

console.log('execFileSync: where git.exe')
console.log(execFileSync('where', ['git.exe'], { encoding: 'utf8' }))

console.log('execFileSync: where git.bat')
console.log(execFileSync('where', ['git.bat'], { encoding: 'utf8' }))

console.log('execSync: where git')
console.log(execSync('where git', { encoding: 'utf8' }))

console.log('execSync: where git.exe')
console.log(execSync('where git.exe', { encoding: 'utf8' }))

console.log('execSync: where git.bat')
console.log(execSync('where git.bat', { encoding: 'utf8' }))
```
Output:
```txt
execFileSync: where git
E:\Programs\depot_tools\git.bat
C:\Program Files\Git\cmd\git.exe

execFileSync: where git.exe
C:\Program Files\Git\cmd\git.exe

execFileSync: where git.bat
E:\Programs\depot_tools\git.bat

execSync: where git
E:\Programs\depot_tools\git.bat
C:\Program Files\Git\cmd\git.exe

execSync: where git.exe
C:\Program Files\Git\cmd\git.exe

execSync: where git.bat
E:\Programs\depot_tools\git.bat
```

So, with that I can tell why changing `execSync` to `execFileSync` worked for me. I have github credentials in the windows git, but not the depot_tools git. (I shouldn't even have the depot_tools version even on my PATH anymore, but I haven't been having any problems, so I forgot it was there.) Since `execFileSync` doesn't spawn a shell it must be skipping over my first git tool(`git.bat`) on my PATH and using the second(`git.exe`), which already had credentials, so the prompt wasn't needed. The NodeJS docs explaining why `execFileSync` would skip the batch file are here: https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_process_spawning_bat_and_cmd_files_on_windows

Fixing the `GIT_ASKPASS` environment var to correctly use VSCode as its AskPass tool is what I am thinking the correct fix may be. I have got it to return an empty string if credentials don't exist using `%LOCALAPPDATA%/Programs/Microsoft VS Code/resources/app/extensions/git/dist/askpass-empty.sh` from VSCode's Git extension. If it should allow the prompt to work, I have got it to use VSCode as the AskPass tool, but I haven't figured out how to make it consistently use it correctly.",NA,https://api.github.com/repos/lostintangent/gistpad/issues/153/comments,https://github.com/lostintangent/gistpad/issues/153#issuecomment-643555472,https://api.github.com/repos/lostintangent/gistpad/issues/153

From what I remember the environments spawned from VSCode inherit some of the VSCode specific vars by default, but I don't remember where I read that, so I am not positive. I think I had read it on something explaining how some scripts executed in the embedded terminal will try to use VSCode for things like the EDITOR if one hasn't been specified, but its been a while since I read about it.
There are at least three places the AskPass tool can be configured, based on the documentation(https://git-scm.com/docs/gitcredentials#_requesting_credentials). Looks like it checks `GIT_ASKPASS` environment var first, then the git config `core.askPass`, then `SSH_ASKPASS` environment var, then terminal prompt if nothing else is found.

Should this extension be trying to make the username and password prompts work or just treating the store as readonly as far as this extension is concerned? It looks like the VSCode Git extension uses `GIT_ASKPASS`, `VSCODE_GIT_ASKPASS_NODE` and `VSCODE_GIT_ASKPASS_MAIN`, which may be why I was getting inconsistencies only setting the `GIT_ASKPASS` var. https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/master/extensions/git/src/askpass.ts#L75

The environment vars being inherited must have just meant for the terminal.

thanks for your quick answer.
Indeed, I don‘t have a workspace open, just startet VSCode empty. But that is the same on every machine I use and gistpad works on the others fine. Funny enough, if I create a new gist, I can do this, but still, it is not shown on this machine (but the others).

I installed and used Code locally, but the only difference between the machines is, that I played with Remote-WSL extension on this machine (but deinstalled it later). Maybe I just reinstall vscode completely on this machine and start from scratch. I will let you know if this helps.

You've actually completely solved a use case I was thinking of about a year ago with these two extensions. Let me explain:

When learning from video tutorials, I figured out it was better to create my own notes rather than coding along with the video, and then do the projects from my own notes. It helped with retention and gave me something to refer back to, but was less time efficient due to double handling.

With GistPad/CodeTour though, it's a cake and eat it too deal. I can set up a tutorial for each course, and create a tutorial step for each video in the course (can simply duplicate the step once it's written then move onto the next one). Using CodeTour I'll write explanatory notes, and that way I've simultaneously coded the project and also written explanatory notes to refer back to, and in a really accessible format that doesn't require too much searching for what I'm after.

With either GistPad or CodeTour on their own, this wouldn't be that amazing. You could CodeTour a whole project but the tour would be impossible to manage or find anything. Likewise, the GistPad Tutorial Playgrounds on their own are great but each step can still be a whole video of content, which can be overwhelming and lacks a happy path.

Together though, in all seriousness, this functionality is an app that I would pay for. I expect it will decrease my learning time and increase my ability to execute my own projects afterward.

The fact that you can also export CodePens is serendipitous too since a lot of courses will have their first video using a CodePen to get people involved with the language before explaining how to set up a local dev environment later on.",NA,https://api.github.com/repos/lostintangent/gistpad/issues/138/comments,https://github.com/lostintangent/gistpad/issues/138#issuecomment-605603842,https://api.github.com/repos/lostintangent/gistpad/issues/138

I tested it, and if using the `Gistpad > Images: Paste Type` setting to `base64` does, in fact, paste the image correctly. But when going back to `file` breaks again.

I also tested this on both sides, Windows and WSL.

The settings sync extension doesn’t synchronize your keychain, which is good, since it shouldn’t ever do that!

Please keep the feedback coming :) Regarding your questions:

1. When you say ""local scripts"", do you mean a script that is located in the playground gist? Or a script that is on your local file system? Currently, playgrounds allow you to reference other scripts in the gist. So you can create a new script file in the file, right-click a local script and select `Copy File To Gist`, or right-click the gist and select `Upload File(s)` in order to upload a script. Is that what you had in mind?

We’re not doing any bundling in order to support modules. We’re simply setting the script’s type attribute to “module”.

1. I have an existing saved file and I want to add it to an existing Gist

However the scope of this item included a couple other stories:

2. I have an unsaved untitled file and I want to save it as a new gist and/or an existing gist, and have it reopen the file as the ""gist"" version (so that future saves go straight to the gist). It will prompt me for both the file name and the new gist name
3. I have a existing saved file I want to create as a new gist. It would prompt me for the gist description and use the file name that already exists.

Trying  story 2  with ""copy file to gist"" does nothing.

Also  story 1 typically is taking 3-5 seconds to open the drop down dialog, and initially I was thinking it wasn't working, any perf improvements that can be done here like just pull up a cached list of gists?

The `/gist` part is indeed required. Without it I'll get a 404 as result.

>
Kind of yes. There are a few extensions which require configuration of GHE. All a bit different.
I've maintaining `vscode-github`, the MS extension `github.vscode-pull-request-github` and yours at least are the ones that I know of.

I've discovered a wired effect in vscode. Its possible to load all the gists in the treeview but when I want to open a file, some of them contain the html from github enterprise for a logged out user.
Are the files cached in vscode? The strange thing is that API calls seems to work, otherwise the tree view should be empty.

So you could get your desired experience using the current version of GistPad.

That said, are you saying that you want to have a description for the gist, but that the name of the file is more descriptive to you? I’m only asking because the description is optional, since it’s meant to add more recognizable meaning to the files, _if_ the file name isn’t itself already meaningful on its own (e.g. index.html doesn’t mean anything without a description). So it seems like there are two potential solutions here:

1. People that want to see the file name vs. the description can simply not set a description when creating the gist. As I mentioned, this is the current behavior today

2. I could add a setting that allows users to choose between tree node label options, so they can control whether the gist node displays its description or the file name

#1 has the benefit of being config-free and responds to the user’s intent (e.g. you didn’t set a description, so you implicitly declared that you care more about the file name than the gist description). So it would be great to understand what your workflow looks like, and why you’re setting a description, but don’t want to actually see it.

Assuming #1 isn’t sufficient because you want to set a description, but still see the node using its file name, then I think #2 is the only option, that doesn’t force users into one specific opinion.

There still may be some value in having a preview display when opening a markdown file.  For example, it might be possible to open the file and the preview at the same time, controlled by a user option.  Or, add a ""Preview"" option in the right-click context menu in the Gist Explorer.

I would really benefit from being able to filter my Gists.  I program in multiple languages and being able to only have my Gists that match the project I am working on would be really helpful.  If I could only of the features from this set today it would be the ability to somehow tag and hide specific Gists that I own.  I use my Gists for more than programming and snippets (like configuration backup) and removing those non-programming Gists from the VSCode UI would be great.

One way that I came up with that would have the considerable flexibility and scalability would be to have the option of adding a GistPad JSON formatted settings file to each Gist.  This file would contain a set of defined flags/labels that the GistPad extension could read when it pulls the Gist to take specific actions like hiding, grouping, displaying based on the loaded workspace in VSCode.

The other way of course would be to save the settings within the extension settings on the host.

Long term would be the ability to set and remove the flags/labels in the UI.

I envision a user setting that, rather than opening the file in the ""ephemeral"" state it gets opened today, when doing an open action, it first gets copied to a temp filesystem and then opened from there in vscode, and when saved and closed, re-uploaded.

So, same transparent download as you mentioned, but then opened in vscode. Saving back changes I guess would be a secondary priority, but it beats my current workflow if I need to debug of:
1. Open file

Interestingly enough, this is also my context a lot of the time, but my preference would be different in that I want to be able to clearly differentiate between what is a swing and what is the existing project (different windows would do this for me easily).

> I'll also give some thought to how to easily allow opening the swing is a new window as well. Stay tuned!

1. `CodeSwing: New Scratch Swing...` command is renamed to `CodeSwing: New Swing...` to avoid confusion with the scratch language, and to prescribe the use of ""temporary"" swings as the main workflow
2. Added the new `CodeSwing: Save Current Swing As...` command, which allows you to save the opened swing in a specified directory. This pairs nicely with the previous addition, since you can quickly create new ""temporary"" swings and save them later if you want
3. Added a new `CodeSwing: New Swing in Directory...` command to create a new swing in a specified directory. This is just a shortcut for doing 1 and 2 at once, if you already know you want to create a swing in a specific location
4. Introduced a template MRU, so that when creating a new swing, the last 3 templates you used will show up at the top of the list
5. Introduced the `CodeSwing: New Swing From Last Template` command, that allows you to create a new swing, using the most recently used template

* When a new (JS) swing is generated, create a new `jsconfig.json` in the temp directory. I'm assuming this isn't difficult because other files (style.css, script.js, index.html) are generated so you just create it along with these.
* Populate the jsconfig.json file with:
```json
{
  ""typeAcquisition"": {
    ""include"": []
  }
}
```
* When a user selects a library, if they choose ""latest"", push the name of that library to `typeAquisition.include` then re-save file.
* This should trigger VSCode to download the types for that library.

I've been doing the above manually and it seems to work well. it's a quick win which gets you 90% of the way there. I couldn't see it being possible with the typescript plugin route.

I am actually teaching a course on React / React Native at UCF (among other courses). 

I was going to take a look later today at possibly submitting a pull request, as I'm very interested in providing my students a tutorial that is both in-editor and not a video.

I'm also working on a larger project that includes a content management frontend for canvas within a VS Code extension, which also includes integrated unit tests / etc for students. The student-facing extension would incorporate unit testing to assess whether a step of an interactive tutorial has been satisfied before advancing, while a server could handle additional unit tests.

It would be great if I could tie jest test results to the progression of the tutorial, as that way it could be integrated into more of an assignment.

I ran across this extension while I was experimenting with doing a more ""typing demo"" style approach, putting timed edits into the buffer. That could still work for hints or if a student has attempted the solution a number of times.

Additionally, CodeSwing exports an API for other extensions to use (e.g. [GistPad](https://aka.ms/GistPad)), and since there's no activation event for other extensions trying to use your API, these consumers would need to manually check if CodeSwing was activated, and if not, activate it. That's definitely not difficult to do, but I wanted to keep things simple since this extension is super new, and I'm exploring integrations with various folks.

Since the `onStartupFinished` event doesn't guarantee when it will be triggered, I was also a little hesitant to relying on it, since it could introduce seconds of latency when trying to open a swing workspace (depending on the extensions/etc. the user has). Once again, not the end of the world. But using `*` provides a couple of nice properties, that couldn't be fully emulated with other activation events.

Out of curiosity: are you seeing CodeSwing impact your startup time? Or did you just see the activation event in the extension details page? I'll do some profiling to see how to further streamline startup, since it should be pretty negligible.

I've been largely optimizing for end-users right now, and so the extensibility documentation is definitely lacking 😞 I can take a stab at improving those, but of course, any PRs would be extremely welcome (since you also have ""fresh"" eyes).

Regarding #1: which files do you want to be visible when you open a light swing? Just `index.ino`?I just ask since you mentioned `points.ts`, and I wanted to confirm if that was a file you expected users to edit, or if it was simply necessary for the built output. I think your request #1 below makes a lot of sense, and I just want to confirm that I fully understand the intended user-experience 👍

Regarding #2: would it be sufficient for now, to have the light swing extension declare an extension dependency on CodeSwing? That way, you could instruct users to install light swing, and they'd get CodeSwing automatically? I like the idea of the `codeswing.json` file declaring NPM packages that it needs, which could include a custom language compiler. However, there may also be benefits to you having a custom VS Code extension, since that might enable other custom experiences (e.g. you could expose a command to deploy the code to your device?).

I also noticed that you're using the ""input"" feature, which is cool to see. I created that as a bit of a proof-of-concept, and so I'd love to learn a bit more about your use case here. Does the index.ino file include the code to define the light animation, and you're using the input file to instruct the swing about the specific animation it should run?",NA,https://api.github.com/repos/lostintangent/codeswing/issues/16/comments,https://github.com/lostintangent/codeswing/issues/16#issuecomment-753655367,https://api.github.com/repos/lostintangent/codeswing/issues/16

I think for the swing it'd make sense for `index.ino` and `points.ts` to be loaded. Basically at-least for my own LED setups I would keep one CodeSwing for each one, and each of those has a different points configuration. It's basically equivalent of a stylesheet I guess... won't be edited often but useful to show it as an input. My ideal layout would be all the source files (.ino or .h) in the top left, the points layout (points.ts) in bottom left, and the display on the right.

The more I think of it I think the extension is actually the right way to go. It would be neat if I could have an extension requirement in the `codeswing.json` and have CodeSwing complain if those requirements aren't met. The inverse can be done with extension dependencies.

As for the input system, ""in production"" my lights function off events that are sent to the devices. I emulated that with the input system... but the code editor view is far from ideal. I think my ideal would probably be having an `input.html` that could have a more sophisticated form to send messages to the display tab. My main problem with the input system as it is, is that the displays typically start off and only light up when they receive an event... the current input system only sends it on change, so after every source file edit I need to manually trigger the event. I can hack that by adding the event to my codes `setup()` function but then need to remember to remove that before deploying.

Right now, if your swing has a `config.json` file, I'll load that and inject it into the preview as `window.config`. I could potentially add support for `config.js`/`config.ts`, that would execute the file, and expose its default export into the preview as `window.config`. Would you be able to make that work? I suppose you'd need to move some of the helper functions from `points.ts` to your stdlib?

Beyond that, I could add support for customizing the name of the config file, and defining that you want the config file displayed when opening the swing (both as settings in `codeswing.json`). That would allow you to call the swing `points.ts`, and have it be automatically opened when you open the swing.

Thoughts? If that proposal would work, it would be pretty straight forward to make the above changes 👍

Regarding the input system: I could make a change to send the input value whenever the swing is run? That would presumably address this issue?

Having it executed is _nicer_, but honestly the solution of just pre-generating a `config.json` with all the point x/y coordinates is an acceptable solution here too. I'd only want it opened up if it could be tweaked live as well.

That would solve the issue for me, but it would be nicer to build some basic UI around it. For my specific case I'd probably want a dropdown list.

It's something that could differentiate CodeSwing from the online versions... since it's already built into a full fledged IDE. It might be specific to my use-case, but I'd imagine there are many more cases where the live editing across multiple files would be useful.

Last (unrelated) question- part of the initial reason I was excited by the CodeSwing idea was the first screeshot/movie you have is of the whole thing operating inside of a browser.

If you look at the code that actually runs on the device, it's split into multiple files for readability: https://github.com/qix/light-swing/tree/main/particle-init

In order to work with code-swing I had to concatenate them into one giant file, and I usually just scroll down to the `#include ""main.h""` line: https://github.com/qix/light-swing/blob/main/test-swing/index.ino

If you want to open an existing swing, you can run the “CodeSwing: Open Swing” command, which lets you select a directory, and opens the swing editor for the respective files. Alternatively, if you open a swing directory directly in VS Code, then the swing will automatically open, since CodeSwing can recognize that the workspace is a swing. Could you try this command and see if it works as expected for you?

To prevent confusion, we could probably update the “CodeSwing: New Swing” command to check for an existing swing in the selected directory, and ask the user to confirm that they want to overwrite it. I’ll try to make that change this afternoon 👍

1. Directory for storing temp swings - By default, this could be a folder within the temp directory (e.g. $TMPDIR/codeswing), but it would allow users to specify their own custom location

2. Format string for naming the temp swings - This would define the naming convention for each temp swing's folder, and by default, could be set to the date and time

I'd also likely rename temp swings to ""scratch"" swings, since they'd no longer be technically temporary (since you could point them at a directory that you're maintaining).

I don't think it'll be related to that method call. The line in question is here in the code:

https://github.com/lildude/phpSmug/blob/c5dc8dbdae6c90d8bea453595b1f71103bc1635e/lib/phpSmug/Client.php#L124

The issue is the argument being passed in is an object but it needs to be a string.

This is a great question, although at its core it's really a SmugMug API question that probably is best asked in the Digital Grin forum at https://dgrin.com/categories/smugmug-api-support-integrations or directly to the SmugMug API team at api@smugmug.com. This GitHub issue tracker is intended for reporting problems with phpSmug's functionality.

However, to get you started off, perhaps we can point you in the right direction.  You are correct that SmugMug's API for the _User_ endpoint doesn't have a (documented) way to list a user's folders. 

However, there is a _FolderList_ endpoint that will return a recursive list of all your folders. Here is a demonstration using SmugMug co-founder cmac's account because it already appears in the API documentation: https://api.smugmug.com/api/v2/folder/user/cmac!folderlist  (Replace 'cmac' with your own username.)

If you remove _!folderlist_ from the Uri, you can see the other data you can query from the _Folder_ endpoint: https://api.smugmug.com/api/v2/folder/user/cmac!folderlist

Please note that all the folder-related API endpoints are listed as depreciated and could disappear at anytime, which is unfortunate because they are useful.  In their absence, you would need to look up your username's Node ID and use the node-traversing endpoints. It would require many more API calls to sort through all the child nodes to find the folders, so I'm not sure why they are depreciating the useful functionality.

Regarding the missing albums, do they all appear correctly when you use the _UserAlbums_ endpoint on the live API browser?  Again, an example with cmac's data: https://api.smugmug.com/api/v2/user/cmac!albums

It may be that some of your albums are not being returned due _count_ and _start_ arguments, which control the size of returned data pages. On the live API browser, SmugMug limits responses to 10 objects per page. Of the top of my head, I'm not sure how they break up JSON responses.

Best wishes!

The API itself suggests manual encoding of options is _not_ required so phpSmug passes this on to you and expects you to use the options _exactly_ as they're returned by the API.

So in the case of ordering, the API supports the following (taken from the JSON from `https://api.smugmug.com/api/v2/user/{username}!albums#json`):

```json
""Parameters"": {
    ""GET"": [
        {
            ""Name"": ""Order"",
            ""Required"": false,
            ""ReadOnly"": false,
            ""Default"": """",
            ""Description"": ""Order Albums By"",
            ""Type"": ""Select"",
            ""OPTIONS"": [
                ""Album Settings"",
                ""Position"",
                ""Last Updated (Descending)"",
                ""Last Updated (Ascending)"",
                ""Date Added (Descending)"",
                ""Date Added (Ascending)""
            ],
            ""MIN_COUNT"": 1,
            ""MAX_COUNT"": 1
        },
        {
            ""Name"": ""MinimumImages"",
            ""Required"": false,
            ""ReadOnly"": false,
            ""Default"": 0,
            ""Type"": ""Integer"",
            ""MIN_VALUE"": 0,
            ""MAX_VALUE"": 16777215
        }
    ]
},
```

From this output, you can see the ordering string is `Date Added (Descending)`. 

Use that exactly (I've removed default options)...

```php
$albums = $client->get(""user/{$username}!albums"", array('count' => 2, 'Order'=>'Date Added (Descending)'));

I hear you 😞. When I first switched to using Guzzle for the HTTP requests I did a little experimenting with caching with a few different Guzzle-compatible caching modules but found I needed to get hacky or overly loose with the caching as SmugMug's headers don't encourage clean caching. Using a local DB or storing the response in a local JSON file is probably the least hacky and most performant of all options at the moment.

Possibly. The [API docs](https://api.smugmug.com/api/v2/doc) have a wealth of info along with the [Live API Browser](https://api.smugmug.com/api/v2), though in this case I'm not sure it'll be more precise as according to the [API docs](https://api.smugmug.com/api/v2/doc/pages/concepts.html#status-codes), the 400 error code means ""Your request contained invalid parameters or was otherwise invalid"" so it may not be able to determine which parameter is at fault. It looks like this may be the case as it's returning what you'd get if your used `$client->options()` to query the params the endpoint takes.

Regarding the truncation, Guzzle, the library phpSmug uses for the HTTP requests, is what is truncating the response. You may find enabling debugging will get you the full response. Something like this:

```php
$options = [
  ""AppName""   => ""[Your app name]"",
  ""debug""     => true,   # This enables Guzzle's request debug output
  'OAuthSecret' => ""[Your OAuthsecret]"",
];

$client = new phpSmug\Client(""[Your OAuth token]"", $options);
$client->setToken('[your access token]', '[your access token secret]');
$response = $client->post('[path/to/new/album]', $options);
print_r($response);
```

That all said, I've seen this problem crop up when peeps JSON encode the params they're passing to methods like `$client->post()`, like in https://github.com/lildude/phpSmug/issues/37. 

Are you by any chance doing this?  If so, there's no need to. phpSmug will do it for you.

Are you able to successfully install phpSmug independently of your application using: `composer require lildude/phpsmug`?

As an example, here's a very quick run through I've just done:

```
$ mkdir foobar
$ cd foobar
$ composer require lildude/phpsmug
You are running composer with xdebug enabled. This has a major impact on runtime performance. See https://getcomposer.org/xdebug

```

At this point, I can create a simple `index.php` containing:

```
<?php
require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';
$client = new phpSmug\Client('bogusapikey');
print_r($client);
?>
```

... and running this works a treat:

```
$ php index.php

    [APIKey] => bogusapikey

If this works, it means there's probably a problem with your `composer.json` file (problem 1) and you're probably referencing the wrong directory in your application when calling the `autoload.php` which is causing problem 2.

Yes, this is expected as the example is very simple and does not store the returned authentication token for security reasons.

You'll need to save the authentication token returned by the API to some location of your choice and then use it as detailed in the docs at https://github.com/lildude/phpSmug/blob/master/docs/authentication.md

Of the two, I suspect it may be the latter, in which case the simple fix would be to change your other code or rename the class in phpSmug.

phpSmug 4 won't suffer from this problem as it now use Guzzle for the HTTP requests rather than including it's own request code.

There's also the complexity of the plethora of caching options out there. guzzle-cache-middleware has interfaces for Doctrine cache, Laravel cache, Flysystem and each of these have their own options for caching data.

Given that the SmugMug response headers don't encourage caching and the complexity involved for the various caching implementations, I'm not going to implement caching again directly into phpSmug. Instead I'll document how you can use guzzle-cache-middleware to implement caching with your choice of implementations.

To obtain the `AlbumID` and `AlbumKey`, you need to call `$f->albums_get()` which calls `[smugmug.albums.get](http://api.smugmug.com/services/api/?version=1.3.0&method=smugmug.albums.get)` which is done in all of the examples just before the `$f->images_get()` method call. For example, in [line 59 of the example-anon.php](https://github.com/lildude/phpSmug/blob/master/examples/example-anon.php#L59) example.  

All the examples pick the first album in the list returned by `$f->albums_get()` so if you know the album in the 3rd in the results, you could use:

``` php
$images = $f->images_get( ""AlbumID={$albums['2']['id']}"", ""AlbumKey={$albums['2']['Key']}"", ""Heavy=1"" );
```

If you're hard-coding the `AlbumID` and `AlbumKey` values, you won't need to perform the `$f->albums_get()` call when rolling out your code into production.

ProTip: phpSmug includes a [debug function](https://github.com/lildude/phpSmug/blob/master/phpSmug.php#L133) that you can use during development to review the results of any method call, for example:

``` php
$albums = $f->albums_get( 'NickName=<NICKNAME>' );
phpSmug::debug( $albums );
```

... would show the results of your `$f->albums_get()` call.

A couple of questions:
1.  Are you able to view the image if you copy and paste the URL into a browser window when you are NOT logged into SmugMug's website?
2.  Which authentication method are you using to obtain the list of images?
3.  Are the images password protected?
4.  Is the album that holds the images password protected?
5.  Is ""Privacy"" within the album that holds the images set to ""unlisted"" within the settings for this album?
6.  Is ""External links"" within the album's settings on SmugMug set to ""yes""?

View the page I linked to in my first response for details on how to change this within SmugMug.

You can actually check this from the API using `$f->albums_get(array('Extras' => 'External'));`

You'll get a response similar to:

```

            [External] => 1   <================= HERE

_It appears the host your running this code on can't actually communicate with the SmugMug API endpoint (api.smugmug.com)._ 

...and asked if you were behind a proxy or firewall.

As you can upload some images, I don't think this is an issue with your communication unless you have an anonymous proxy or firewall that is throttling your connections or blocking your access after a certain amount of data has passed through.  You'll need to check with your network admins to see if this is the case.

I'll do some testing to see if I can reproduce this issue (I'm not behind a firewall or proxy which limits me in anyway).

In the mean time, could you make sure your PHP has Curl support compiled in and enabled (you may need to just enable the extension) and try using Curl to upload by adding the following line just after your `$f=new phpSmug(""APIKey...` line:

``` php
$f->setAdapter('curl');

Note, this will only work if you actually have curl support in your php instance.

It appears sometimes api.smugmug.com is a little slow to respond and it doesn't send any data within the 30 seconds phpSmug allows it to respond.

At the moment, there isn't an easy way to increase this time out without modifying the source, but there are two solutions I've found:
1.  Do as per my previous note and use a foreach() loop to loop through the array of URLs without the refresh and allow SmugMug to pull the images in it's own time.  You may need to increase the maximum execution time for php scripts on your server to allow this, or break up the list of image urls into smaller chunks.  This may not necessarily resolve the issue though as the API could still be slow for one of your requests.
2.  Modify phpSmug.php and add `'timeout' => 60` to the `$this->req->setConfig()` in the `__construct()` method as follows (I've added it to the end of the line):

``` php
$this->req->setConfig( array( 'adapter' => $this->adapter, 'follow_redirects' => TRUE, 'max_redirects' => 3, 'ssl_verify_peer' => FALSE, 'ssl_verify_host' => FALSE, 'connect_timeout' => 60, 'timeout' => 60 ) );
```

If this last one works for you, I'll need to create a method to make setting this easier, or possibly just increase the default to 60 seconds.

In our case we serve a ""legacy"" and ""modern"" bundle in ES5 and ES7 respectively, using the ""Differential Loading"" pattern to only serve to clients that support either. Our polyfill file is handled in a similar way. Handling it via `import()` would be better, but muddies our code base with support conditionals, and our IE11 user base is tiny!

Just that your comments state:

```
// Using the `clipboard/text` build saves code size.
// This is recommended if you only need to copy text.

I realize that the specification considers `navigator.clipboard` to be `readonly`, though if it's falsy, chances are the browser hasn't implemented it, and it's very likely just `undefined`.

Overwriting `navigator.clipboard` in such browsers is useful to avoid extra logic on call sites where your code assumes the presence of `navigator.clipboard`. So, the intention was not to unconditionally overwrite the native binding, but rather to set it in the first place in case it's missing.

Basically, while this is most definitely not possible due to the specification:

```js
navigator.clipboard = await import(""clipboard-polyfill"");
```

this should work as expected for older browsers:

```js
if (!navigator.clipboard) {
	navigator.clipboard = await import(""clipboard-polyfill"");
}

Indeed, most browsers expect you to copy directly in response to a user gesture, and you should expect the copy operation to fail if you introduce any significant delay.

There's nothing that a library can do to help with this, although I recommend keeping up with the new clipboard API developments for potential delayed copy operations.

Safari compat is quite annoying to repro, since Safari releases are tied to OS releases.

> I will note that the WebKit devs were pretty confused by `copyUsingTempSelection`, both by what it's trying to do and why it's considered necessary for desktop Safari.

`copyUsingTempSelection()` exists because `document.execCommand(""copy"")` does not trigger in WebKit (and only WebKit) if there is no selection: https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=156529

Our code tries `copyUsingTempSelection()` before `copyUsingTempElem()` because adding an element to the DOM has side effects (e.g. triggering mutation observers), and I would like to avoid unnecessary side effects as much as possible.

Unfortunately, it seems that iOS and desktop diverge on the bug you're describing: https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=177715

If you're still in contact with the WebKit devs, I'd appreciate comments on the two bugs I've linked in order to convey the impression that this is preventing things from working in Safari. :-)

(There are more bugs, but these are the two major ones. See https://github.com/lgarron/clipboard-polyfill/blob/master/experiment/Conclusions.md if you're interested in more details.)

In here I attempted to:

- Get rid of Webpack, it is a module for commonJS so just transpiling with TSC is enough. To cover uglification I added [uglifyjs-folder](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uglifyjs-folder)
- Get rid of the `Makefile`. We're writing a JS lib here so lets not mix it with C/C++ stuff. NPM Scripts does just fine for all purposes
- Replace all tests with the Jest framework to run them
- Cleanup folder structure
- Some minor fixes in the lib that I stumbled upon while compiling (these are not covered prior because you weren't using the TypeScript Compiler itself. Very odd.
- Cleaned up the `package.json`


Anyway the reason why I haven't PR'd from that branch is because these reasons:

1. When I now run the `browser-star` test it prints ❌ and I honestly have no idea how that test is supposed to function at all (note: my browser is Vivaldi which is Chromium based)
2. Jest throws a lot of ""navigator"" and ""window"" being undefined, for obvious reasons since Jest isn't being ran in any browser. An initial thought I had was that this may be resolved by using something like jsdom but I have no experience there at all. Maybe you got some ideas,
    - Note that as temporary solution I have suppressed all UnhandledRejections but this should really not stay to be honest because monkey patching tests is as good as not having tests at all imho.
3. I wasn't sure if you wanted the changes as listed above at all

This only changes what is pulled in when people do `yarn add clipboard-polyfill` / `npm i  clipboard-polyfill`. After a adding it through a package manager editing the source has major downsides:

1. For JavaScript devs they'd have to transpile it before being able to use it. They may not even know how to do this.
2. Edits to files in node_modules are entirely lost upon the next `yarn install`, `npm install` or when taking whatever project is being worked into a production environment. Especially for this library which targets webdevs you can be assured that everyone who takes this lib into a production environment has that environment off-site hosted somewhere; be that a VPS or something like Google Firebase.
  - And especially in the case of the latter these edits made cannot be re-applied.
3. Actual edits that other people want to do can be done through forking the github repo and doing `npm install GitHubUsername/Repo` (or, yarn add again). They could even publish their own fork to NPM, doing so doesn't void neither this package's license nor NPM's rules.

I could probably come up with a few more if I would put in the time for it but I need to focus on work too.

> * Get rid of Webpack, it is a module for commonJS so just transpiling with TSC is enough. To cover uglification I added [uglifyjs-folder](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uglifyjs-folder)

I don't like the idea of using `webpack`, but it seemed like the most common option at the time (and it still took significantly more work than I would like). I'd prefer to avoid revising the build system unless there is a benefit other than simplicity.

> * Get rid of the `Makefile`. We're writing a JS lib here so lets not mix it with C/C++ stuff. NPM Scripts does just fine for all purposes

I know that Javascript now has standards for this, but I'd be pretty insistent on keeping a `Makefile`. I maintain projects in a lot of languages, and using `Makefile` for all of them helps me context switch with minimal frustration.

(That said, I'm perfectly fine with turning individual `Makefile` actions into trivial wrappers around `npm` commands.)

> * Replace all tests with the Jest framework to run them

No strong objections to this, as long as it's easy to run tests in all typical configurations.

(Current ""tests"" are a mess because real tests require user interaction. I don't think there's is a good solution that doesn't involve manual testing, although an end-to-end test with UI automation in a Docker container might be worth the effort.)

> * Cleanup folder structure

I prefer my source files in the top folder (putting them in a source folder always smells like ""configuration creep"" to me), but I'm open to some restructuring!

> Get rid of Webpack, it is a module for commonJS so just transpiling with TSC is enough. To cover uglification I added uglifyjs-folder

There is actually a golden rule emerging these days that says `Rollup for libraries, Webpack for apps`. This golden rule was spearheaded [when React switched their build process to Rollup](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/9327) and you can read the ""why"" in that PR. Rollup can directly process TypeScript, I've created a single library myself with Rollup so far. Oh and [here is a medium article on the topic](https://medium.com/webpack/webpack-and-rollup-the-same-but-different-a41ad427058c) (can't share this lib as it's private-to-work)

> Get rid of Makefile

I can see where you're coming from here. The problem is that on a barebones system (especially Windows) `make` is not available as a command while, since we're doing NodeJS, `npm` is which is why I promoted the switch to npm scripts. On the topic of ""middle grounds"" and ""status quo"", what we could do is first move all the actions that makefile currently does to NPM scripts and then in the Makefile we call those scripts. That way you can continue to use Makefile the way you always have and other users can just use the NPM scripts.

> Jest framework stuff etc

Jest is primarily for unit testing. For E2E testing there are libs such as [Google Chrome's Puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer) or [TestCafe](https://github.com/DevExpress/testcafe). Admittedly I haven't explored either yet although I do have an open story on my work's tracker board to do so, so I expect that I can say more about this in a couple of months .... hopefully. Regardless, for unit testing Jest already makes it all a LOT easier since it requires basically no setup at all as opposed to some of the alternatives. This being because it's a framework as opposed to a library (like Mocha, which requires Chai for assertions and Sinon for stubbing for example).

Every time I look into this, I get really frustrated with the state of Javascript module compatibility. My understanding is that based on how you're doing this, either of `import clipboard from 'clipboard-polyfill'` or `import * as clipboard from 'clipboard-polyfill'` might work or fail, but the former is ""the right way"" to import a default export.

- works with the same import statement everywhere, and
- does not break backwards compatibility,

```sh
npm version <patch|minor|major> #depending on the version increase
git commit -s --amend --no-edit
``` 

Explanation:

`npm version <patch|minor|major>` bumps the package.json version by whatever you specify while adhering semantic versioning. For example `major` from `2.72.89` would go `3.0.0` or minor from same `2.73.0`. It then creates a git commit of `v<whatever_new_version>` and a matching tag (both that `v` and the tag creation can be configured) 

`git commit -s --amend --no-edit` amends the commit that was just created. `-s` specifies that you want to add a `Signed off by AUTHOR <EMAIL>` wherein AUTHOR and EMAIL are the ones you configured in `~/.gitconfig` (`%USERPROFILE%/.gitconfig` on windows) (or through `git config --global user.email` etc) and finally `--no-edit` specifies that it shouldn't open the as-configured default git text editor to edit the commit message.

Naturally you can also automate all of this with a bash Function:

```sh
#!/bin/bash

function librelease() {
  if [[ $1 == major ]] || [[ $1 == minor ]] || [[ $1 == patch ]]
    then
      npm version ""$1""
      git commit -s --amend --no-edit
    else
      echo ""Please provide either major, minor or patch as first argument to this function""
  fi
}
```

Ah, there's the issue! This isn't specific to `clipboard-polyfill`, but you have make sure that `clipboard.writeText` receives `clipboard` as its value for `this`:

    // Explicit `bind`:
    somePromiseThatReturnsAString.then(clipboard.writeText.bind(clipboard))

    // Arrow function
    somePromiseThatReturnsAString.then(text => clipboard.writeText(text))

    // `await` (requires being in an async function)
    clipboard.writeText(await somePromiseThatReturnsAString)

This isn't obvious, because many browsers now bind functions like `console.log` for convenience so that you don't have to do this – but it's necessary in the general case. If you try it in Chrome, you'll see that `somePromiseThatReturnsAString.then(navigator.clipboard.writeText)` also fails.

At the moment, there is not. Browsers require specifying the data to be copied synchronously at copy time (and the copy action must be triggered in direct response to a user gesture). If you absolutely cannot have your data ready synchronously, I suggest having a button to generate the data, which then reveals an actual copy button when the data is ready.

Make sure to call `clipboard.writeText()` directly in an event handler for a user gesture (e.g. a click). If you wait for an AJAX call to respond, then the browser won't consider your copy action to be triggered by the last user gesture, and block it. (Chrome has a 1-second grace period for this.

as far as I know, you can only iterate over the `items` object within the `DataTransfer` instance. You already have the `m` object. Why not simply add the additional `items` object as an `Array` and in case of `setData`, after `this.m[type] = value;` simply call `this.items.push({type: type, value: value})`. Of course it's not that easy, because you should handle the case if an existing type gets overridden so the items entry must be removed accordingly.

Cool, thanks for opening this. A few thoughts:

* Can the callback receive information about what was actually copied, for it to inspect? I guess a `ClipboardPolyfill.DT`.
* If a copy was not user-initiated, I wouldn't want the callback to happen at all. The point of `interceptCopy` is to intercept user-initiated copies--why would I need to intercept a copy I initiated myself? Maybe it should even be called `interceptUserCopy`. (If a copy was not initiated by the user, then presumably it was initiated by `clipboard-polyfill`, right? It should be possible to know when an event is due to the library itself.)
* I don't quite understand what the semantics of an asynchronous callback would be. What if the user did a paste before the async action was completed? They would get the original, un-intercepted copy data, right? I think synchronous is fine--I wouldn't expect to be able to do time-consuming things in event handlers anway. (If you need to do an additional async call to `execCommand` under the hood because of browser bugginess that's fine, as long as there's a very short window in which the user could potentially sneak in a paste and get the wrong result.)

> As documented in https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=156529 , Safari doesn't allow document.execCommand(""copy"") when there is no selection.
> It is possible work around this bug by creating a temporary selection: https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=156529#c4
> 
> However, this workaround is broken on iOS. After the temporary selection is selected, document.queryCommandEnabled(""copy"") returns true and a function registered using document.addEventListener(""copy"", ...) fires. *However*, `event.clipboardData.setData()` has no effect.
> 
> Consider the following sample:
> 
>     <script>
>     document.addEventListener(""copy"", function(e) {
>       e.clipboardData.setData(""text/plain"", ""This is plain text."");
>       console.log(e.clipboardData.getData(""text/plain""));
>       e.preventDefault();
>     });

>     function copy() {
>       var sel = document.getSelection();
>       var range = document.createRange();

Conceptually:
- This unnecessarily muddles levels of abstraction.
- One presumably wouldn't write a Javascript function to the clipboard. Passing it in the same way as a regular value would be confusing (personally, I would expect that to convert the function to a string or some serialized format, not to run the function).
- The API currently provides an imperative functions, not listeners. It is not normal to accept functions as arguments unless they are callbacks. Since both callbacks and Promise-based APIs are still in common use, I would prefer not to add a new _kind_ of function that you can give to the API.

So it seems clear to me that running a function on behalf of the caller is ""not the job"" of a library like this.

However, I'm not against adding it here if it provides strong practical convenience.
Are there cases where `clipboard.copy(fn)` is useful in addition to `clipboard.copy(fn())`, and where the developer cannot be reasonably be expected to handle it themselves?
Are there other precedents?

> I initially assumed I could pass a function and was surprised it wasn't in there!

I'm curious to know why; would other developers perhaps also think that?)

Forgot to mention: no, I don't think the documentation gives this impression. It just seemed like a common idiom to me, as a full-stack programmer, to pass functions into other functions in JS.

Also, it didn't occur to me simply to slap `()` onto the end of my inline function declarations in order to pass the result in. That will certainly do the trick.

Thanks for putting the library up, btw. I like its methodology and how lightweight it is.

In HTML, `&amp;` encodes `&`, so this copies the markup as it was specified.
I don't think it's appropriate to try to add extra layers of escaping for your use case – it could lead to unexpected behaviour for other use cases (ones that do rely on unescaping markup characters), and trying to cover cases across all browsers could lead to an unending game of whackamole.

As a workaround, you could either copy plain text, or find a workaround in LibreOffice ([this](https://help.libreoffice.org/Writer/Turning_Off_AutoCorrect) or [this](https://help.libreoffice.org/Common/Replace#Replacement_table))?

I already filed a bug ticket over there, but I doubt that it will be fixed because rich text link copying works from all programs that I have tested so far. Only  clipboard.js fails because it cannot generate a valid http query url. By the way W3C requires that an ampersand character must be http-encoded if it is ambigous. All major browsers follow this recommendation by http-encoding the ampersand in query strings when copying a link in rich-text-mode with the effect that LibreOffice is able to correctly interpret the url.

The way it is, clipboard.js cannot be used to reliably generate URL Links that can be used in LibreOffice and possibly other programs as well. Simply passing strings in a 1:1 manner and not trying to decode anything would solve all these issues at once.

It seems to me that you're passing a string meant as ""unencoded HTML"" to an API that takes encoded HTML. If you write an HTML document and would like `http://example.com/index.php?oid=1&amp;pid=2` to show up as text on the page, you will have to [write it in the source as `http://example.com/index.php?oid=1&amp;amp;pid=2`](https://jsfiddle.net/d1y9115g/1/).

> Simply passing strings in a 1:1 manner and not trying to decode anything would solve all these issues at once.

`clipboard.js` itself does not attempt to decode anything. If you specify that a string containing `&amp;` should be interpreted as `text/html`, then I only see one correct behaviour.
In order to support what I think you're asking for, we'd have to _add_ (un)decoding where there is currently none.

If you need to copy rich text containing strings with escape characters, would it be sufficient for you to create the rich text in via DOM APIs?

Doubtful, as `document.execCommand` [isn't supported](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/execCommand) by IE8.

If you consider how much that browser sucks, and combine it with the fact that Microsoft will drop support for it in less than a month, I'd say there isn't much point in trying to do better. Anyone wanting programmatic copy/paste in IE8 should look into ZeroClipboard or something similar.

My best guess is that `TEMP_MASK_IMAGE` is either incorrect, of that `temp_folder` is not created.

Could you add

```
print(""TEMP_MASK_IMAGE:"", TEMP_MASK_IMAGE)
```

before `subprocess.check_call` on line 171, and add

```
print(""temp_folder:"", temp_folder)
```

on the line after `temp_folder = tempfile.mkdtemp()` on line 239?

I get the following output:

```

Could you check that:
1) `temp_folder` has a sensible path,
2) the folder is actually created by `tempfile.mkdtemp()`, and
3) the correct value for the created folder is passed to `create_iconset` and used to calculate `TEMP_MASK_IMAGE`?

It is more readable to use hard indents, and then mnify your code for
production.

Human readability is more important during development, and simple
minification like Grunt solves any specific issues for production.

> Comma-separated values should include a space after each comma.
> 
> Don't include spaces after commas within rgb() or rgba() colors to differentiate color values from CSS properties that allow multiple values that are already separated by a comma and space. Also, don't prefix values with a leading zero (e.g., .5 instead of 0.5).

These two guidelines go hand-in-hand. The goal is to make `rgb()`, `rgba()`, `hsl()`, and `hsla()` values appear as a single meta value within your CSS. Multiple values, like those of a box-shadow, should have a space after the comma. Color values, however, shouldn't, as a means of differentiating the two.

Here's a longer example of both these rules combined:

``` css
/* With the space after commas within color values. */
.element {
  color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.75);
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
  box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 3px, 6px, 0.15), inset 0 1px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
}

/* Without the space, but with the space between multiple values. */
.element {
  color: rgba(255,255,255,.75);
  background-color: rgba(0,0,0,.5);
  box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0,3px,6px,.15), inset 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,.5);
}
```

That's a rather extreme example, and honestly one that doesn't make that much sense color-wise :laughing:. However, it demonstrates the difference in how the scannability of CSS is affected by too much spacing within property values.

And yes, that section should probably be updated to include these other color options and the `rect` value.

I always use this ordering:

I feel that the first ones are the most important/relevant for defining the element, get less specific as you go along; therefore `class` is at the end as the least relevant.

But yes, from quick testing, this is the least bad approach (fundamentally, because of the use of `<iframe>`, this will always be more verbose than strictly necessary, but assuming that pages will use these sparingly, it's not as bad).

as an example of convoluted/verbose behavior, on MacOS/Chrome when encountering an iframe, VoiceOver will have two separate stops when you navigate with reading keys (CTRL+ALT+cursor left/right): one for the ""group"", and then one for the ""frame"" (and then the user has to actively say they want to navigate into the iframe, and then they'll get to the link inside). For the frame, it seems Chrome does expose/use the `<title>` of the iframe itself (no other browser/AT combo I checked does this though, so uncommon).

The old/current iframe is thus experienced like this

Star twbs/bootstrap on GitHub, group
Star twbs/bootstrap on GitHub, frame

With this PR, it at least limits this a bit to

GitHub, group
Star twbs/bootstrap on GitHub, frame

MacOS/Safari is less verbose with VoiceOver, and only announces the frame itself (using the `title=""...""`).

The old/current one is announced as

Star twbs/bootstrap on GitHub, frame

With this PR, it's

GitHub, frame

Windows/Chrome and NVDA only announces the frame (no extra ""group""), so here the announcement is similar to MacOS/Safari. If navigating by TAB, it currently announces quite verbosely, when jumping to a link inside the iframe from outside the iframe:

Star twbs/bootstrap on GitHub  frame, Star twbs/bootstrap on GitHub  visited  link

With this PR, it limits it to something more manageable

GitHub  frame, Star twbs/bootstrap on GitHub  visited  link

Another thing, do we need the Emoji fonts? Also, I'd use the font stack we use in Bootstrap v4, minus the emoji fonts. `-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, ""Segoe UI"", Roboto, ""Helvetica Neue"", Arial, ""Noto Sans"", sans-serif`. We should also split the font and not use the shorthand, like we do in Bootstrap. **EDIT**: done

**EDIT2**: I keep hitting the GitHub API rate limit when developing locally because the unauthenticated limit is 60 requests per hour. I need to figure out how to bypass it with a personal token otherwise it really slows me down 😛

**EDIT3**: I bypassed the API rate limit but I had to use `curl` to check the API responses. Apparently there's no way to access this info from the user API AFAICT, for example check out the result of  `curl -i https://api.github.com/users/mdo`. @mdo feel free to ask internally if it's possible and let me know. If it's not possible let's clean up the code.

Actually, my point wasn't about duration, it was about the ability to isolate one axis instead of having to pass all the values at once.

If you could just change one axis without affecting the others at all, that would be something I would find very useful.

First thing I noticed is that your animations are note set properly. They have to look like this

``` js
item[3]
  .animate({
    translate: [vectorSize, vectorSize, 0]
  },  animSpeed, 'ease-out-quart');
```

so the second argument is not an object but an integer (animations time in milliseconds).

Then there are several ways to solve you `world.stop()` problems. First, you don't really have to stop the world. But if you really like to, you can add `world.start()` at the beginning of your `animaHandler` to make shire it's started and then `setTimeout(function () { world.stop() }, animSpeed * 2)` at the end of your `animaHandler`. So your final code should look like this.

``` js
function animaHandler() {
   //here are all necessary calls and variable definitions
   world.start() // only in case you haven't started it yet

  item[0]
    .animate({
      translate: [-vectorSize, -vectorSize, 0]
    }, animSpeed, 'ease-out-quart');

  // other animations

  setTimeout(function () { world.stop() }, animSpeed * 2)
}
```

But as far as they all have the same animation length, something like

``` js
  item[0]
    .animate({
      translate: [-vectorSize, -vectorSize, 0]
    }, animSpeed, 'ease-out-quart')
    .end(function () { world.stop() });
```

should work

I hope that helps.

The solution with setTimeout has solved the problem. In my case the object[x].animate(...).end(...) would stop the element x from being animated.

I have shortly read about requestAnimationFrame and I must say that this way to handle animations is pretty decent. And as you stated I wouldn't necessarily have to stop it in most cases. The reason behind it is I am tweaking some heavily scripted theme and I wanted to make my inclusion as lightweight as possible. 

Anyways :+1:  and thank you for help

it like item3 will record previous animation, do again , then do new animation.

Thanks for your prompt reply.

Besides animation, can I set css style to the item using css(""property"",""value"")?

What I like to achieve is :

item.animate(…).css(…).animate(…).attr(…).function(){

});

Is it possible to do this kind of flexible chaining? Or I have to use Animation events of Anima.js?

Thanks!

Chaining fixes are excellent but ... this still doesn't completely solve this use case. I want to move the ball to the right based on an event, without the wiggle ever stopping. Very hard to do!

This obviously doesn't work:
http://jsfiddle.net/N2v6H/6/

Of course I can hardcode it, breaking down each increment of the wiggle into four sequential steps and adding up the translate values in advance:

http://jsfiddle.net/N2v6H/9/

This works, but it is really tedious, inflexible and error-prone, even for a very simply animation like this one. For example, what if I don't know whether the wiggle animation is running at the time that the click event happens? There would need to be some math here getting the exact properties at the time of the animate call, and re-expressing the animation as a new sequence of animations. This is always the place where smaller js anim libraries seem to break down.

So it will override any values of `transform`, that were set with other library, but it shouldn't override any other property or strip the `style` attribute.

If overriding `transform` is your case, this behavior will be fixed in future versions. If it really strips off `style` attribute, I'll take a closer look at this issue. Thanks
