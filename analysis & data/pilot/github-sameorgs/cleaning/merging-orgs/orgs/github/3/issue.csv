I not found any proposals on this. Is it possible to introduce herarchical structure? Currently we in able to make linear list of settings/variables (excepting environments).

I think it will be helpful to be able to avoid repeating for some settings like:
```yml
database_host: localhost
database_name: postgrdb
database_user: postgrusr
database_pass: 111

# or

deploy_user: root
deploy_port: 2121
deploy_server: example.com
deploy_dir: /var/www/domain
deploy_branch: master
```
It might be look like this:
```yml
database:
  host: localhost
  name: postgrdb
  user: postgrusr
  pass: 111

# or

deploy:
  user: root
  port: 2121
  server: example.com
  dir: /var/www/domain
  branch: master
```
This is only for definition things. I think it's need to be merged into single string variables as well as previously: `deploy_user` (although it may be available and by the new way)

In this case the first level keywords like `development`, `production` or `test` can work as previously - to define environment.
```yml
production:
  database:
    user: prod_user
    pass: prod_pass
```
This feature will especially helpful for some developers who uses variables prefixed with an app name, like:
```yml
app_database_name: db_name
# ...etc.
```

Thanks for Figaro.

I'm thinking about moving one of my apps from Heroku to Elastic Beanstalk on AWS.

Figaro seems to be Heroku-focused. As far as I can see, I have a few options to make Figaro work on Elastic Beanstalk.

1) Copy the environment variables into my Elastic Beanstalk environment one-by-one.

I'd like to avoid doing this if possible because I have a lot of them and it is bound to be error-prone.

2) Just remove application.yml from the gitignore file.

I haven't tested this yet but this seems like the route of least resistance. It obviously undercuts the whole purpose of using Figaro in the first place though.

3) Generate a remote configuration file

You mention this is in the docs but I can't see any examples. I'm not sure what this means. Could you elaborate a bit on how Figaro could retrieve a file from an S3 bucket, for example?

I'd like to be explicit about what's being loaded and avoid hidden conventions. Think about Bundler and how you `source ""https://rubygems.org""` at the top of every `Gemfile`. The Bundler team could have made that the default source since it is 95% of the time, but they opted for clarity.

Unfortunately, when testing the engine using a tool like [Combustion](https://github.com/pat/combustion), we see that the Railtie to load figaro is added immediately after the definition of `Figaro::Rails::Application`. 

This can (and sometimes does) mean that the `before_configuration` block of that Railtie is immediately executed. At this point, the `Figaro.adapter` is still `nil`, so it is lazily created as a `Figaro::Application`. The Railtie then calls `Figaro.load` on it, and it blows up as `default_path` throws a `NotImplementedError`.

The solution is to set the adapter to a `Figaro::Rails::Application` as soon as possible, and before the Railtie is created.

Though I'm listing `bonsai-elasticsearch-rails` above `figaro` in my `Gemfile`, the `application.yml` file is not parsed before Bonsai Elasticsearch Rails is loaded, and causes Bonsai Elasticsearch Rails to not find the environment variable.

I believe this is because `Figaro.load` is kicked off in Railties here: https://github.com/laserlemon/figaro/blob/master/lib/figaro/rails/railtie.rb#L5, and that this takes place after the gems are loaded.

So even explicitly calling:

```
require 'figaro'
require 'bonsai-elasticsearch-rails'

we have two very similar instances of our application (staging and production) which are both based on the `production` environment.

Problem is we have to set different env variables for these two instances. As explain in https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/deploying-to-a-custom-rails-environment, it is not recommended to create a `staging` environment since we want to keep production and staging environments as close as possible and it adds complexity.

My suggestion would be to consider an additional env variable such as `FIGARO_ENV` for the `application.yml` file so we can have:

``` yml
production:
  S3_BUCKET: 'my-bucket-production'

staging:
  S3_BUCKET: 'my-bucket-staging'

But only one Rails environment. What do you think about this?

``` ruby
group :development, :test do
  # Call 'byebug' anywhere in the code to stop execution and get a debugger console
  gem 'byebug'
  gem 'figaro'
end
```

Then it installed the version `1.1.1`. When I tried to access the `ENV['user_name']` it returned `nil`.

To fix this I had to fix my version to `1.0.0` explicitly.
Now its fixed..

So could you please find out what the problem is?

Figaro is really useful, thank you.

I'm using Heroku, and when I display the config vars:

```

... some are defined more than once.

Heroku' advice is to set all vars with uppercased keys.
From https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/add-ons:

> Alias names must always conform to the same naming conventions as config vars.They must begin with a letter and can only contain uppercase alphanumeric characters or underscores.
### 1

So... when we execute `figaro heroku:set --remote staging -e staging` for example, why Figaro doesn't automatically set the keys to uppercase?
### 2

What to do next?
Must I set the vars in `application.yml` with mixed keys like:

```
staging:
  <<: *default
  app_name: 'someapp (staging)'
  SENDGRID_USERNAME: app123456@heroku.com
  SENDGRID_PASSWORD: 123456
  WEBSOLR_URL: 'https://index.websolr.com/solr/0e1122334455'

I've noticed that the [Figaro::ENV#get_value](https://github.com/laserlemon/figaro/blob/master/lib/figaro/env.rb#L40) method uses a loop to find the variable every time.

This is very slow, especially when the size of `ENV` is very large. The [ENV](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/ENV.html) is a hash-like variable that allows us to do a O(1) lookup.

I think we can change the method into something this:

``` ruby
def get_value(key)
  ::ENV[key] || ::ENV[key.upcase]
end
```

I also noticed #189 mentioned the possible memory leak of current code. If we change to the code above, it should avoid the issue too.

I've recently moved from Heroku to Dokku, but love Figaro's approach to configuration management, so I've added some initial support for Figaro to push configurations to a Dokku app.

The rake db:\* tasks run twice in the dev environment when RAILS_ENV is not set:

The following configuration:

application.yml

```
development:
  MYSQL_DATABASE: rails_dev
  MYSQL_USER: rails_dev
  MYSQL_HOST: 127.0.0.1
  ...
test:
  MYSQL_DATABASE: rails_test

  database: <%= ENV['MYSQL_DATABASE'] %>
  username: <%= ENV['MYSQL_USER'] %>
  password: <%= ENV['MYSQL_PASSWORD'] %>
  host: <%= ENV['MYSQL_HOST'] %>


test:
  adapter: mysql2
  database: <%= ENV['MYSQL_DATABASE'] %>
  username: <%= ENV['MYSQL_USER'] %>
  password: <%= ENV['MYSQL_PASSWORD'] %>
  host: <%= ENV['MYSQL_HOST'] %>
```

results in rake tasks being run twice when RAILS_ENV is not specified:

(assuming one's db does not have rails_dev and rails_test defined)

```
$ bundle exec rake db:create --trace
** Invoke db:create (first_time)
** Invoke db:load_config (first_time)
** Execute db:load_config
** Execute db:create
rails_dev already exists
```

This is more obvious in the case when you are trying to drop the dbs:

```
$ bundle exec rake db:drop --trace
** Invoke db:drop (first_time)
** Invoke db:load_config (first_time)
** Execute db:load_config
** Execute db:drop
Database 'rails_dev' does not exist

$ bundle exec rake db:drop --trace
** Invoke db:drop (first_time)
** Invoke db:load_config (first_time)
** Execute db:load_config
** Execute db:drop
Database 'rails_dev' does not exist
Database 'rails_dev' does not exist
```

This behavior is caused by the active record lib/active_record/tasks/database_tasks.rb trying to be super-extra helpful and setting environments to an array containing both development and test, instead of leaving it alone:

```
  def each_current_configuration(environment)
        environments = [environment]
        # add test environment only if no RAILS_ENV was specified.
        environments << 'test' if environment == 'development' && ENV['RAILS_ENV'].nil?
```

Net result is that the rake tasks are run twice due on development environment when RAILS_ENV is not specified, due to how figaro is hooking into rails.

A workaround is to specify RAILS_ENV on the command line or in your environment, but what sane person would do that:

```
$ RAILS_ENV=development bundle exec rake db:create --trace
** Invoke db:create (first_time)
** Invoke db:load_config (first_time)
** Execute db:load_config
** Execute db:create
$ RAILS_ENV=development bundle exec rake db:drop --trace
** Invoke db:drop (first_time)
** Invoke db:load_config (first_time)
** Execute db:load_config
** Execute db:drop
```

So there you have it. I haven't looked into figaro's internals to figure out whether or not this is fixable. 

Hopefully this report will save folks some time and hair from being pulled out in frustration.

I think it would be nice if Figaro had an easy way to change the name or method of accessing the env variables. You can't just do 

```
config = Figaro.env
```

So as a workaround you can do something like this in the config/initializers/figaro.rb

```
#Rename Figaro to be something meaningful.
module Config
  extend self

  def respond_to?(method, *)
    Figaro::ENV.respond_to?(method)
  end

    def method_missing(method, *)
      Figaro::ENV.send(method)

#Now you can access the value via
Config.stripe_api_key

I am trying to deploy my project on a private server with Capistrano. I am using [capistrano-figaro-yml](https://github.com/ChouAndy/capistrano-figaro-yml) to automatically upload my `application.yml` file as a shared file, but that's just a detail. I am not sure my issue is a real issue of Figaro, but I am looking for help.

My issue is that the object `ENV` is empty of my values from `application.yml` when I try to launch Rails as server or console. I tested the content of `ENV` in both `config/initializers/devise.rb` and `config/application.rb` files.

**Edit**: another strange behaviour, I edited my `config/initializers/devise.rb` to avoid the exception from Devise, `rails console` launches and my `ENV` values are available. Is it a normal behaviour in Figaro not to have the values inside initializers but only once the application is properly launched?

What I don't understand, is that it works perfectly on my laptop, in both development and production environments. I removed the symbolic link created by Capistrano to write my own `application.yml` file to check if it wasn't the symbolic link that didn't work, but no changes. I can access `Figaro.env` so Figaro is properly loaded, but keeps being empty from my values. I installed the last versions of all my gems to be sure, nothing happened.

I looked deeply (at least I think I did) on the Internet to find anyone with my issue, but as I don't find lots of answers, I guess the issue is from me, but I really can't find where.

Do you have an idea of why `ENV` would be empty? Thank you. And btw, thank you for your amazing job with Figaro, that helped me so much these past few months.

The gems for the console application are segregated via Bundler group, and it is the console application we're interested in using Figaro with, i.e.:

``` Gemfile
source 'https://rubygems.org'

gem 'rails'

group :console do
  gem 'figaro'
end
```

When our console application starts, it uses Bundler.require(:console) to bring in figaro (along with its other gems), and that ends up doing a `require 'rails'` from `lib/figaro/rails.rb`. Under normal circumstances this would probably be ok (the require would just fail), but since we have rails in our Gemfile, the require succeeds and rails is inadvertently loaded.

This unfortunately breaks some other gems our console application is relying on which guard against Rails-specific behavior by explicitly checking whether or not the `Rails` constant is defined.

I believe the fix for this is straight-forward, instead of explicitly requiring rails, we can check whether or not Rails is defined in `lib/figaro/rails.rb` and initialize the railtie and set the default adapter appropriately.

I suspect that it has to do with the fact that they keys no longer match the keys that were there previously.

Unfortunately, I see nothing in the documentation for Figaro that talk about changing the keys. Everything I've seen in my searching has to deal with proper indentations, but I know the indentation is proper because it was working just fine before changing the keys.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

### Profiling results 2 (improved Figaro::ENV#get_value)

I am not 100% percent sure how to interpret those results, but my testing revealed that https://github.com/laserlemon/figaro/blob/master/lib/figaro/env.rb#L41 is causing the leak. I replaced the implementation of the method with

``` ruby
def get_value(key)
  ::ENV[key.upcase]
end
```

and the profiling results were looking much better:

### How to proceed?

Obviously, a direct lookup in the `ENV` hash is much more memory efficient than iterating over all keys and downcasing them. Since Figaro allows case-insensitive access to environment variables, this change would break this feature. I am not into the development plans for figaro, but are there any plans on fixing this? Perhaps figaro could hold an internal representation of the environment allowing accessing it as a hash instead of iterating over all values? This should also be a big performance gain...

I've recently moved from Heroku to Dokku, but love Figaro's approach to configuration management, so I've added some initial support for Figaro to push configurations to a Dokku app.

This pull request includes code, specs and documentation updates - hope this is useful. It's my first rodeo with Thor so I've based it on your Heroku code, and I'm sure there are improvements to be made.

Say your deployment process require you to have your configuration at a certain file path or that you want to provide defaults for different platforms in development.
You can achieve this by using an environment variable to tell Figaro where to look for your yaml file.

``` bash
$ docker run -e FIGARO_PATH=./config/application.docker.yml my-container rails s
```

``` bash
$ FIGARO_PATH=/storage_device/configuration/my_app_variables.yml rails s
```

If you're not using rails or if you want to determine the file path by other means, set the `Figaro.adapter.path` to your desired value.

``` ruby
require ""figaro""
Figaro.adapter.path = ""/my/config/file.yml""
Figaro.load
```

---

Now you can get your environment variables using environment variables

At some point in the recent past our application was updated to figaro 1.0.0.rc1 from 0.7.0.

This change introduced some logic that lets figaro set environment variables it ""owns"", but skips loading them otherwise:
https://github.com/laserlemon/figaro/commit/ac00b48025d38819615c926ad394a23948d6f914

Since our application updates are done via USR2 signal to Unicorn, it seems that even though we've brought in the new figaro gem, the skip? logic is preventing it from replacing/updating those variables which had previously only existed without the _FIGARO_ prefix. 

The fix was either:
1) do a downtime deployment of the application (cold restart)
2) patch the lib/figaro/application.rb file to ""return false"" from the skip? method as a one-time fix so that it properly set the prefixed environment variable names, deploy the code, then undo the patch and deploy as normal

Huge fan of this gem, and have been using it for some time, but have always wondered about the best ways to share the application.yml file as it's updated. The file is correctly ignored by git for security reasons, which leaves us to other methods of sharing it that aren't as accommodating for multiple people updating it. I live in fear of the day that we accidentally overwrite one of our api keys because changes aren't merged together.

Has anyone found a good, secure way of sharing an application.yml file amongst a team that doesn't have the same danger of overwriting changes?

1. Give special treatment to any environment named 'test' so that environment variables are overridden even if they are present.
2. Introduce a `Figaro.reload` command which can be called in the spec/test helper. This could potentially clear out any figaro-set environment variables and reload application.yml

I struggled with writing a test that would test whether Spring actually loads that file into it's watched file list.   Loading up Spring within the context of the Aruba sub-rails application in a test proved difficult.  

![Inception](http://media0.giphy.com/media/yAOjunY81Trjy/giphy.gif)

It could be argued that such a test isn't necessary - Spring is now a part of Rails, and should be expected to perform as described - a test should cover that we interface with their system correctly, not test their system.  

Regardless, if such a test is implemented, it should test whether Spring.watcher.files includes config/application.yml

I spun up a new rails app, and pointed the figaro gem to my fork - Spring successfully watched config/application.yml upon figaro installation without any further user input. Pictures of such are below.

and it does indeed work with Rails v.3.2.13

```
  username: <%= ENV[""POSTGRES_USR""] %> 
  password: <%= ENV[""POSTGRES_PWD""] %> 
```

Realize Rails 4 has a similar solution to Figaro, but you still may wish to update README. 

Cheers,

This results in the following productivity leaks around configuration:
1. Someone adds a setting, but forgets to add it to `application.yml.sample`. Later another developer has an error that is difficult to understand until they remember to check for a missing setting.
2. Someone adds a setting and does add it to `application.yml.sample`. But this is part of a bunch of other changes and later when another developer pulls they don't notice it, and they lose some time until they realize there's a new setting.

In theory there should be communication happening of course, but it doesn't always, so I propose an OPTIONAL feature to figaro to make it **noisy**:
1. an `application.yml.sample` is required.
2. When you use a key in development or test environment that is not in **both** the `application.yml` and `application.yml.sample` figaro logs a warning (perhaps optionally it raises)
3. When your `application.yml` does not contain a key that is in `application.yml.sample`, figaro logs a warning at initialization time
4. For `rake`, `rails console` & `rails server` (and maybe also `foreman`) this warning should be prominent & colored

What are your thoughts? Is this something you would consider accepting, or would I be better off doing a `noisy_figaro` fork?

1. `git update-index --assume-unchanged config/application.yml`, but it requires un-checking each time I want to modify `application.yml`
2. Using `dotenv` gem at the same time as figaro. This way variables unset on figaro have fallback on `dotenv`, so I can set appriopriate values on un-committed `.env` file. It still feels weird to include two gems for env management.

What about supporting `.env` in `1.0` as fallback to `application.yml`. It would be change compatible with `dotenv` gem, easing the transition, and would allow such awesome feature I described. Hm?

I am working on a project with Rails 4 and Capistrano 3 and I am using Figaro to handle the configuration variables.

When I try to access Figaro variables from a Capistrano task I have found this caveat:

To use Figaro.env I have to load Rails first (which capistrano 3 is not doing by default). I do so like this:

ENV[""RAILS_ENV""] = ""staging"" # This is necessary or Rails.env will be ""development"" and Figaro will use development vars instead of staging.
require File.expand_path('../environment',  __FILE__) 
```

Is there a way to make figaro do its thing (make variables for a certain environment accessible as ENV[""blah""]) without loading Rails?

Isn't it possible to expose the functionality in a public method and then if the gem is used by Rails, call this method in the hook as you do now?

``` ruby

I'd attach code with pleasure but I wanted to discuss it first. I consider this change as a breaking one. I believe I'm not alone in using `Figaro.env` syntax to force crash when env variable is not provided and all those people would have to introduce changes in their applications.

However I have the impression that there is no proper way of using optional configuration variables.

When a configuration variable is not defined, `Figaro.env.my_optional_variable` raises. We can still use `ENV[""MY_OPTIONAL_VARIABLE""]` or `Figaro.env.respond_to?(:my_optional_variable)`, but the first solution does not allow stubbing, and the second solution does not allow to simulate (in test) the case where the optional variable has not been set.

I see 4 solutions to this problem. Depending on the preferred solution, I may try to implement it, and make a pull request.

**First solution**
Let `Figaro.env.my_optional_variable` return `nil` when the variable is not defined. This is consistent with `ENV[""MY_OPTIONAL_VARIABLE""]` but I wonder what `Figaro.env.respond_to?(:my_optional_variable)` should return. Always `true`? Anyway, this could be considered as a breaking change.

**Second solution**
Implement a method `Figaro::Env#set?(method)` that returns true if the variable has been set and is not blank:

``` ruby
# Returns true if configuration var has been set to a non blank value
def set?(method)
  respond_to?(method) && send(method).present?
end
```

Developper should use this method to test if an optional configuration variable has been set. Contrary to `respond_to?`, we can simulate an undefined configuration variable by stubbing `Env#my_optional_variable` to return `nil` (or an empty string).
Example with [Mocha](https://github.com/freerange/mocha):

``` ruby
Figaro::Env.any_instance.stubs(my_optional_variable: nil)
```

Note: I stub `Figaro::Env.any_instance` instead of `Figaro.env` because the later doesn't seem sufficient in some cases. It may be related to #57.

**Third solution**
Modify `Env#method_missing` so that calling `Figaro.env.my_optional_variable?` is equivalent to calling `Figaro.env.set?(:my_optional_variable)` as described in the second solution.

**Fourth solution**
Let Figaro use a file with default values for configuration. All optional configuration variables would be defined here with an empty string, so we can test if a configuration variable is missing with `Figaro.env.my_optional_variable.blank?`.
This is a bigger work, but would also respond to #50 and #49.

development:
  HELLO: developers

I am aware that [README](https://github.com/laserlemon/figaro#how-does-it-work-with-heroku) suggests setting RAILS_ENV.

Already, Heroku's RAILS_ENV is set correctly (to 'production'), so this value should be accessible:

```
$ heroku run rails console
> ENV['RAILS_ENV']
=> ""production""
```

Oddly, `bundle exec rake figaro:heroku` works correctly, after doing `heroku config:set RAILS_ENV=production`.

Even without that, doing `bundle exec rake figaro:heroku RAILS_ENV=production` instead will also work.

But IMO these ways aren't as good, and shouldn't be necessary.

A tiny (Rails) test [app](https://github.com/MarkDBlackwell/try-figaro/commit/e4e767bb50c83d43658fba994d0cd79af1c5b559) fails.

Rubygems.org [figaro](https://rubygems.org/gems/figaro) doesn't specify Ruby 1.9.2, nor does [README](https://github.com/laserlemon/figaro/blob/master/README.md).

It doesn't get the error if the Heroku app is running Ruby 1.9.3, but Ruby 1.9.2 is running locally.

EDIT: It doesn't get the error when Ruby 1.9.2 is running locally, and the Heroku app is running Ruby 1.9.3.

The workaround for now is to do the following:

```
AGS_DB_DATABASE: """"
AGS_DB_USERNAME: """"
AGS_DB_PASSWORD: """"
AGS_DB_HOST: """"
AGS_DB_PORT: """"

```

Is this an expected functionality for the 0.6.X if it is just close the issue.

I have this config:

```
NAME:         ""ØVERBYE""
ENGLISH_NAME: ""OEVERBYE""

Ø is a Norwegian character.

The problem is that it will be escaped when accessing `ENV['NAME']`. So firing up my console gives:

```
1.9.3 (main):0 > ENV['NAME']
=> ""\xC3\x98VERBYE""
1.9.3 (main):0 > ENV['NAME'].encoding

```
1.9.3 (main):0 > ENV['ENGLISH_NAME']
=> ""OEVERBYE""
1.9.3 (main):0 > ENV['ENGLISH_NAME'].encoding
=> #<Encoding:UTF-8>

This is important because usually we deploy our configuration to staging/production server. Allowing Figaro to fetch particular environment will be huge benefits to securely export configuration based on environment. Say you have `capistrano` task:

```
namespace :deploy do
  task :config do
    run_locally %Q(rails runner 'puts Figaro.env(""#{stage}"").to_yaml' > _application_.yml)
    transfer :up, '_application_.yml', ""#{shared_path}/application.yml"", via: :scp
    run_locally 'rm _application_.yml'

Now we have specific `application.yml` on each server without contains any other environment configuration.

It would be nice to have a `rake figaro:travis` Rake task to add the `env` configuration to `.travis.yml`. Currently, Travis only supports `env` configurations in the clear but there's a [pending pull request](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-core/pull/45) that would allow you to encrypt them.

I added to your cucumber suite, and did a bad thing by putting another class in your railite. :/

I am more than happy to move it out, as well as write unit tests, but seeing as rspec/minitest/whatever was not set up, I figure that would be something we could manage later.

First, thank you for this.  We see this problem a lot with Diaspora and deploying to Heroku, but also all of the other crazy ways people deploy the app.

I think this would fix many of the problems we are having.  One feature I really like from SettingsLogic is support for overrides in each rails enviroment

ie you can put things in a :development or :production name space, and they are mashed into the top level settings, overriding any nonspecific setting with the same name.

I'd be in to contributing, or getting one of our contributors to make it happen.  Would you have any preferences to how this feature could get coded?

Please describe.**
Currently, when clicking on the calendar icon in VSCode, a new markdown file is autogenerated and added to a configurable directory.

The filename is the current date, and the same date is used to populate the first header in the generated file:

**`2021-03-25.md`**
```md 
# March 25, 2021
```

I really like how one click gets you to immediately writing a new note for the specific date.

**Describe the solution you'd like**

I would like it if it was possible to change the generated content in the markdown file to include some basic frontmatter metadata so that it would look something like this:

**`2021-03-25.md`**
```md 
---
title: March 25, 2021

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
I can just write in the required frontmatter text every time, but it kind of goes against the spirit of clicking on the button and immediately getting to writing.

Please describe.**
Opening a public repo with GistPad to read code could be faster. 

The current process is:
1. `⌘+Shift+P`
2. `> GistPad: Open Repository`
3. Type repository name

As a point of comparison, github1s is a very fast way to view a GitHub repo's codebase from inside a web-based version of Visual Studio Code, e.g. [https://github**1s**.com/codespaces-contrib/gistpad](https://github1s.com/codespaces-contrib/gistpad) – you just add `1s` to the URL in your browser tab.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
If there was a ""Open in VSCode"" button on GitHub repo pages, I would click that button often – specifically for reading/searching code quickly. The simplest way to enable that would be a link handler URI scheme.

A URI scheme would be broadly useful. For example, it would let `README.md` for boilerplate repos add a `Open in VSCode` button, which would be faster than pasting `git clone` into your terminal and opening the repo in a local folder 

I would be happy to make a ""Open in VSCode"" button as a very simple Chrome extension (it would just add a button with the link in a good spot on repository pages). 

I do have access to Codespaces, but I don't currently use it because for writing code, I would rather use my own editor/environment.

Please describe.**
Out of the box, the setting `gistpad.playgrounds.autoSave` defaults to `true`. Many a times, this leads to accidental edits being persisted to the github gists. 

I now have to visit `gist.github.com` to see the gist's revision history and figure out how to undo these accidental changes.

Most of the times, I simply wish to open my gists for reading/viewing only.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
The setting `gistpad.playgrounds.autoSave` should default to `true`. Let the users choose to explicitly persist changes (if any).

I use a small number of repositories for daily note-taking (non-work, work) and having to pick them out of the repository list can be frustrating, especially when I have a lot of repositories tracked from organizations which come before my github username, 

e.g.
- Acme/somerepo
- ...many Acme repos...
- taddison/garage-wiki (the repo I want at the top)

**Describe the solution you'd like**
I'd like to specify one or more repos to appear at the top of the repository list.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
I could change my GitHub username to be aaaddison 😅?  And then name any daily repos to be named such that they'll always appear at the top.

I just like this extension and can see it being a part of my workflow)

**Describe the bug**
There is a big list of keyboard shortcuts (filter the list by `gistpad`), which are all unassigned by default.

I wanted to rename gists using F2, like you can with files in the explorer.
There's a command for this, `gistpad.renameFile`.
When I run this though, I get the warning, `Cannot read property 'path' of undefined`.
I've tried focusing different things in case it requires a specific 'When' case.

As far as I know, this actually applies to all of them, so perhaps it's just not fully implemented :smile:

**To Reproduce**
1. Open keyboard shortcuts
2. Filter the list by `gistpad`
3. Assign shortcut to any of these
4. Try using them.

**Expected behavior**
They should do carry out the specified action

Scratch notes are named with the current date in a format such as `November 19, 2019.md`.
I like to write in here, then move to a 'real' gist with the same name (and an appropriate tag) when I'm sure I won't scrap it.
Personally, I'd prefer not to have a comma in the filename, and be something like YYYY-MM-DD for sorting (if I'd need to).

**Describe the solution you'd like**
I'd like to be able to specify the naming convention.

In order to enable this SEO enhancement, we just need to update categories in `package.json`. I would also suggest we add Snippets since gists can be viewed as short code snippets in loose terms.

I'd like to use some more exotic packages and currently there's a limited set of packages available through cdnjs. I know you can paste in urls from the likes of jsdelivr and unkpkg but I'm just not sure how to use some packages like this. I think they have to be designed with these services in mind.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
A solution could be to use snowpack which is developed for ""Unbundled Development"" which is something that gistpad seems to be designed for.

Since this seems to be enough to use up the rate limit over time, it'd be nice if it at least warned that that's happening when you're not signed in, or somehow cached the results or perhaps even blocked entirely until signed in?

When this extension GistPad of version 0.1.8 and/or the extension `:emojisense:` of a recent version is enabled, string autocompletion in Markdown will be suppressed.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

0. Make sure GistPad of version 0.1.8 and `:emojisense:` of any version disabled or uninstalled
1. Enable autocompletion in Markdown with below settings
   ```json
   {
       ""editor.quickSuggestions"": {
           ""comments"": true,
           ""other"": true,
           ""strings"": true
       },
       ""[markdown]"": {
           ""editor.quickSuggestions"": true
       },
   }
   ```
2. Open any Markdown file, and the autocompletion works as the first screenshot shows, where GistPad is of version 0.1.7
3. Install or enable GistPad of version 0.1.8. Alternatively, install or enable `:emojisense:`
4. The autocompletion is now suppressed and broken, like in the second gif screenshot. You can see the string completion is suppressed almost immediately

**Expected behavior**
Autocompletion should remain intact and completions should not be suppressed.

**Desktop (please complete the following information):**

- VS Code Version v1.47.2
- GistPad Version v0.1.8

**Additional context**

1. I rely on autocompletion heavily when writing Markdown
1. Since `:emojisense:` is shipped along with this extension and can also be the culprit, it is mentioned too
3. Annoyingly, the extension ""GitHub Pull Requests and Issues"" can also be the culprit under some circumstances.

Please describe.**
I have been using gists a lot lately and GistPad helps me manage all that without leaving the editor. I embed these gist URLs in my blog posts and reference them at several places. With the GUIDs embedded into these gist URLs, they tend to be very long. I am, at the moment, using git.io to shorten these urls and then embed into my articles. 

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Having a context menu option to ""Copy GitHub short URL"" will be quite useful.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
I am using a [PowerShell module](https://github.com/rchaganti/PSGitIo) that I published for this purpose.

Get ""TypeError: Cannot read property 'sha' of undefined"" when click just created `[[wiki link]]`.

**To Reproduce**
1. I created a repo using [foam-template](https://github.com/foambubble/foam-template)
2. I added the repo into GitPad repositories
""Open Today Page"" works just fine
""Add new file"" works just fine
If I add a new wiki-link, and press 'enter' a new file creates just fine
3. If I add a new wiki-link, and **without hitting enter** open the link using ""option + click"", I get an error.

I expect that clicking at new link will create a file.

This changes `execGitCredentialFill` to set the `GIT_ASKPASS` environment variable to the `askpass-empty.sh` script from the VSCode git extension when calling `execSync`. By making AskPass use `askpass-empty.sh`, the credentials prompt should be skipped when credentials are not set and return an empty string for the the password. So, it should make `execGitCredentialFill` a readonly function instead of getting hung when `git credential fill` tries to ask for credentials.

**Additional context**:
When `git credential fill` is executed and there are not any credentials, it tries to request credentials from the user. Unless the AskPass tool is configured correctly, `execSync` gets stuck when there are no credentials, because it is waiting on input, but `execSync` didn't get any output yet. So they both just sit there waiting on a response from each other, without knowing each other is waiting.",NA,TRUE,https://api.github.com/repos/lostintangent/gistpad,https://api.github.com/repos/lostintangent/gistpad/issues/156/labels{/name},https://api.github.com/repos/lostintangent/gistpad/issues/156/comments,https://api.github.com/repos/lostintangent/gistpad/issues/156/events,https://github.com/lostintangent/gistpad/pull/156,https://api.github.com/repos/lostintangent/gistpad/pulls/156

_Originally posted in https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/99688_. The comments panel is always appearing even when I am not in any GistPad project. I explicitly hide the comments panel since I don't use/need it, but on reload it keeps appearing.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Open panel
2. Hide ""Comments"" view
3. Reload
4. Comments view re-appears

**Expected behavior**
If I hide the comments view, do not make it re-appear. Would be better to have a setting to disable comments all together.

Gist works fine, I have put in my access token and I can open gists fine. But when I go to the GistPad extension and try logging it just says 'activating extension' at the bottom, but nothing ever happens.
I already tried uninstalling Visual Studio Code and starting from scratch, but that didn't help.

Any idea as to why it won't sign me in? I can't see any error messages.

I am using GistPad + Gist + Visual Studio Code successfully on a Windows machine. And I did the same, first downloaded Gist, signed in an created a profile with an access token. Then started using GistPad - works perfectly.

**Steps to Reproduce:**

```
1. Create a text file with some content either locally or directly in the Gist.
2. Refresh GistPad so that the file resides in both locations.
3. Check that you can view the file.

Try steps 4.x or 5.x

4.1 Rename the file locally by adding a backslash to the file name.
4.2 Refresh GistPad.
4.4 Check that the file was updated in the Gist
4.5. Try to view or rename the file locally.

OR

5.1 Rename the file in the Gist by adding a backslash to the file name.
5.2 Refresh GistPad.
5.2 Check that the file was updated locally and is visible in the tree.
5.3. Try to view or rename the file locally.
```

I ran across this today when trying to view a file from a Gist that stores configuration files.  The Gist files are named by prefacing their filename with their path, and on a Windows system that includes a backslash.

If I go into the Gist and change or remove the backslash character it works. If I rename a local file from a Gist by adding a backslash it does rename the file and push it back into the Gist but after that all other attempts to read or rename the file again to remove the backslash fail.",NA,FALSE,https://api.github.com/repos/lostintangent/gistpad,https://api.github.com/repos/lostintangent/gistpad/issues/128/labels{/name},https://api.github.com/repos/lostintangent/gistpad/issues/128/comments,https://api.github.com/repos/lostintangent/gistpad/issues/128/events,https://github.com/lostintangent/gistpad/issues/128,NA

The goal is to make it easier for users to try out the playground experience, and then gradually onboard to regular authenticated users.

This PR needs some more work before it can be merged, for example
- [ ] alert user that saving the gist is not saving it to their accounts, and prompt them to sign in
- [ ] one click action to fork when the user signs in
- [x] there's a ""description undefined"" error that shows up right after the playground is created
- [ ] default templates are not available if the user is not authenticated

It happens with 0.0.17 and later.

Reproduce by trying to open a markdown file in a gist from the explorer window.  A preview pane appears instead of an editor.

I suspect this may be caused by this new code in commit f9d9c08c2f9e13b5c71bd873e36da1371390f507:

```typescript
export async function openGistFile(uri: Uri) {
  const extension = path
    .extname(uri.toString())
    .toLocaleLowerCase()
    .substr(1);
  let commandName;
  switch (extension) {
    case ""md"":
      commandName = ""markdown.showPreview"";
      break;
    //case ""ipynb"":
    //  commandName = ""python.datascience.opennotebook"";
    //  break;
    default:
      commandName = ""vscode.open"";
  }
```

It looks like it is intentionally doing a preview for a markdown file.  This makes it impossible to locally edit markdown files in a gist.  I admit to not reading all the code to fully understand this, but it looks suspicious.

I've tried disabling all markdown extensions with no improvement.  And I'm not certain if I am doing anything wrong, so please let me know if that's the case.

In retrospect, this might seem obvious, but I think the biggest issue is that the VS Code Interface doesn't mention that it's been zoomed in/out. I've been caught off guard with the actual website turning out to be a scaled version of what I expect.

Ideas on possible fixes:
 - Have a setting that allows you to keep the preview window at 100% regardless of your VS Code scaling (but does anyone really need a scaled version of a website you're prototyping?)
 - If it's not possible to change the preview window scale separately from the interface scale, maybe there can be a warning on the console warning the user that the interface has been scaled, so they aren't caught off-guard.

Some other strange-feeling behaviors:

3. You can close the Swing file without the preview tab closing. There could be a UI state where you have the old preview tab still around, but unrelated files in the existing project open.
4. If you close the preview tab, it closes all other files (also unrelated ones)
5. If you start a new Swing in an existing project with some files open, it will try to close those files (and lead to confusing, seemingly unrelated warnings such as `Are you sure that you want to close <unrelated buffer tab X>?`

Right now, these are the steps:

1. <kbd>cmd</kbd>-<kbd>shift</kbd>-<kbd>p</kbd> -> `CodeSwing: New Swing...`
2. Get thrown into a file selection window, which is confusing and distracting, figure out that you need to choose a folder for the files to go
3. Create a new folder in this dialog, with no good suggestion for a default folder name (""untitled folder"" is the default on macOS)
4. Get a long list of options that the user needs to choose from (if the user <kbd>cmd</kbd>-<kbd>tab</kbd>s away from VS Code, this disappears, leaving the empty folder behind)
5. Choose one of these options
6. Start coding

1. Visit https://codesandbox.io/s/new?file=/src/App.js

1. <kbd>cmd</kbd>-<kbd>shift</kbd>-<kbd>p</kbd> -> `CodeSwing: New Swing...`. This will automatically create a folder with an auto-generated name to hold the Swing files within some VS Code directory, which can be customized afterwards if the user wants.
2. Get a long list of options that the user needs to choose from (this stays, even when user <kbd>cmd</kbd>-<kbd>tab</kbd>s away from VS Code). The last-used templates are listed at the top in reverse-chronological order.
3. Choose from the list of templates
4. Start coding

Suggestion 2: And something even faster, for those who know what they want:

1. <kbd>cmd</kbd>-<kbd>shift</kbd>-<kbd>p</kbd> -> `CodeSwing: New Swing with Last Template`. This will automatically create a folder with an auto-generated name to hold the Swing files within some VS Code directory, which can be customized afterwards if the user wants.

This may be a long shot but worth asking.
Is it technically possible to get completions for libraries added in the ""script.js"" pane? I can imagine this isn't easy but would be awesome if doable.

So ""jQuery"" for example. Its added in my ""scripts"" array. Can definitions be pull down on the fly and used by VSCode? 

## Automatic Type Acquisition
We can rely on VSCodes  [Automatic Type Acquisition](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/nodejs/working-with-javascript#_typings-and-automatic-type-acquisition) it sounds like we can force this in a jsconfig.json file and VSCode does the rest. Just auto generate the file and place it in the same directory as the script.js. Below ive done it manually.

Before:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/936006/106065197-d95c7780-60f2-11eb-8591-33fc4df2cd8d.png)

Then in the same folder I add `jsconfig.json`
```
{
  ""typeAcquisition"": {
    ""include"": [""jquery""]
  }
}
```

After:

That works well!
The only downside here is we can't force a specific version. I think VSCode just grabs the latest.

> Automatic type acquisition will always download the declaration file for the latest version of a library. If you're using a different version, there may be mismatches between what's shown in Intellisense and what's actually available at runtime

## skypack 
I just found that Skypack supports typescript declarations in its CDN. It sends the path in its header response. More info here:
https://docs.skypack.dev/skypack-cdn/api-reference/lookup-urls#typescript-declarations

jQuery: https://cdn.skypack.dev/jquery
jQuery Type: https://cdn.skypack.dev/-/jquery@v3.5.1-GJsJJ2VEWnBDZuot9fRf/dist=es2020,mode=types/index.d.ts

I'm not sure how easy it is to traverse those types and download them

It would also be nice to point directly to type declarations but I don't think that's possible right now.
https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/28985 might be a blocker

@FredKSchott  can Skypack/Snowpack be utilised here in anyway?

- Create a new CodeSwing in a subdirectory with either multiple steps or with subdirectories.
- Record a codetour, annotating the files.

Firstly thanks for your work here! This project is _very_ close to what I've been looking for as I try build out an editor for some of my LED projects. Since uploading to the wall takes ~30 seconds having the emulator makes it much easier to build out patterns. Here's an example one I built for the new year: https://www.facebook.com/509819936/videos/10160610832109937/

I managed to get everything hacked together and working in CodeSwing. The code (both a swing and the extension that implements `codeSwingCompile`) is here: https://github.com/qix/light-swing

It required a bit of reverse engineering since there were no actual examples and the documentation was often misleading. I'll send a pull request with some tweaks there, but an example extension would be super handy as well.

In order to make this really great I have two feature requests that are intertwined. I'd be happy to help work on them but realize it may be quite a deviation from your plans so would be worthwhile to have a discussion first:

a) Support for multiple files.
At the very least for this project I would like two files. The lighting script (which is currently the `index.ino` file) and the coordinates of the LED lights (which is currently hard-coded into the extension, `src/points.ts`). Since these two files would need to be combined to form the output page the current API for `codeSwingCompile` would not work. I _might_ be able to hack it having the `points` file compile down to CSS, but that's not really ideal.

b) Support for `codeSwingCompile` inside the swing
This one is not as major if you're strongly opposed, but I would much rather have my instructions be *Install the codeswing extension* and *open this workspace*. The actual `light-swing` parsing and compilation would be put into a normal JS package, which `codeswing.json` might reference.

I'd imagine the API to be:
`codeSwingCompile(files: { filename: source }): { html, css, script, input }`. That API would also allow multiple input `.ino` and `.h` files. If everything matches what is already displayed only the `checkInput` method is called. Since this is an advanced use case obviously some of the other features such as CodePen export would no longer work.

Thanks again!

<h2>v1.11.0 / 2021-01-03</h2>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<h4>Faster, more reliable installation: Native Gems for Linux and OSX/Darwin</h4>
<p>&quot;Native gems&quot; contain pre-compiled libraries for a specific machine architecture. On supported platforms, this removes the need for compiling the C extension and the packaged libraries. This results in <strong>much faster installation</strong> and <strong>more reliable installation</strong>, which as you probably know are the biggest headaches for Nokogiri users.</p>
<p>We've been shipping native Windows gems since 2009, but starting in v1.11.0 we are also shipping native gems for these platforms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Linux: <code>x86-linux</code> and <code>x86_64-linux</code> -- including musl platforms like alpine</li>
<li>OSX/Darwin: <code>x86_64-darwin</code> and <code>arm64-darwin</code></li>
</ul>
<p>We'd appreciate your thoughts and feedback on this work at <a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/2075"">#2075</a>.</p>
<h3>Dependencies</h3>
<h4>Ruby</h4>
<p>This release introduces support for Ruby 2.7 and 3.0 in the precompiled native gems.</p>

_Notice: Undefined property: stdClass::$Album in /opt/bitnami/apps/wordpress/htdocs/smugmug/index2.php on line 54
Notice: Trying to get property 'Uris' of non-object in /opt/bitnami/apps/wordpress/htdocs/smugmug/index2.php on line 54
Notice: Trying to get property 'AlbumImages' of non-object in /opt/bitnami/apps/wordpress/htdocs/smugmug/index2.php on line 54
stdClass Object ( [Uri] => /api/v2/user/gktwvillage!albums?count=1 [Locator] => Album [LocatorType] => Objects [Pages] => stdClass Object ( [Total] => 0 [Start] => 1 [Count] => 0 [RequestedCount] => 1 [FirstPage] => /api/v2/user/gktwvillage!albums?count=1&start=1 [LastPage] => /api/v2/user/gktwvillage!albums?count=1&start=0 ) )
Notice: Undefined property: stdClass::$AlbumImage in /opt/bitnami/apps/wordpress/htdocs/smugmug/index2.php on line 57
Warning: Invalid argument supplied for foreach() in /opt/bitnami/apps/wordpress/htdocs/smugmug/index2.php on line 57_

2) After reading the transcript of someone else's issue on this forum, I thought that the reason for the above errors was that all of our albums were private; so, I took the answer provided to that user and attempted to use the oAuth example, where I get this error:

_Fatal error: Uncaught Error: Class 'phpSmug\Client' not found in_

Can you offer any suggestions as to how to fix this?

Thanks,
Matt

Our app, which was working fine for most of the year up to last week, now refuses to play due to a 404 error when trying to access /user/ouraccount!albums

Bizarrely:
    - if I change ouraccount in the above to a different Smugmug account, it works;
    - if I change !albums to another endpoint like !featuredalbums, I get no 404; and
    - if I copy the 404'd URL from the app's logs/terminal and paste it into a browser, it sometimes works

I've stripped it down to the code to its bare minimum and here's the offending bit:

    $client=smugmug_instantiate();
    $repositories = $client->get('user/********!albums');
    foreach ($repositories->Album as $alb)
        {
        print ""Album: "".$alb->Name.""\n"";
        }

Literally, if I change our account handle in the above to the name of another account, I get a list of their albums. If I put it back to ours, I get a 404. I even tried changing the name of our Smugmug account temporarily, but got the same behaviour as above with the new name.

The whole of the script I'm testing with is only 16 lines long including the above bit and the instantiate function. If I move it to a different computer on a different network with a fresh phpSmug installation, I _still_ get the same behaviour.

The actual error when run in the terminal looks like this:

```
$ php tryme.php 
PHP Fatal error:  Uncaught GuzzleHttp\Exception\ClientException: Client error: `GET https://api.smugmug.com/api/v2/user/*******!albums` resulted in a `404 Not Found` response:

Is there some reason that should't work? 

My code is extremely simple and initially looked like this:
```php
<?php
ini_set('display_errors', 1);
ini_set('display_startup_errors', 1);
error_reporting(E_ALL);

// This file is generated by Composer

$client->setToken('MY OAUTH TOKEN', 'MY OAUTH SECRET');
# THIS IS THE POINT WHERE IT BREAKS TO START WITH
print ""<br><b>Getting list of repositories:</b><br>"";
$repositories = $client->get('user/MYUSERNAME!albums');
# THIS IS THE POINT WHERE IT BREAKS WITH SECRET IN OPTIONS
print_r($repositories);
...

That fails at the first point shown by my comments above, and gives me a: 
""Fatal error: Uncaught exception 'phpSmug\Exception\InvalidArgumentException' with message 'An OAuthSecret is required for all SmugMug OAuth interactions.' in /var/www/other/smug/vendor/lildude/phpsmug/lib/phpSmug/Client.php:389 Stack trace: #0 /var/www/other/smug/index.php(19): phpSmug\Client->setToken('MY OAUTH TOKEN...', 'MY OAUTH SECRET...') #1 {main} thrown in /var/www/other/smug/vendor/lildude/phpsmug/lib/phpSmug/Client.php on line 389""

First I would like to thank you for your work, which is really helpful to use Smugmug :) !

I have successfully used those functions from the API: loggin/oauth, fetch any kind of element, post a folder, edit a folder, delete a folder, ...

Basically everything is working well, but I'm now trying to upload something, but nothing is working until now (I have a symfony4 environement, last PHP, last version of your library).

**For the Local upload** (as it is mentionned option is optionnal, I removed everything inside):
```
$options = []
$response = $client->upload('album/7Wwsdk', ""/Users/antoinenedelec/Documents/Photos/IMG_0375.JPG"", $options);
```

I then have this response:

> object(stdClass)[1065]
>   public 'stat' => string 'fail' (length=4)
>   public 'method' => string 'smugmug.images.upload' (length=21)
>   public 'code' => int 5
>   public 'message' => string 'system error' (length=12)

I did tried to chmod 777 my file, nothing will do.

**For the external upload:**

```
        $image_allow_insecure = true;
        $image_uri = 'http://lasoundbox.fr/img/app_bg.png';
        $image_cookie = '';
        $image_title = 'test';
        $image_caption = 'Caption';
        $image_hidden= false;
        $image_file_name = 'test.jpg';
        $image_keyword = '';

        $options = [
            'AllowInsecure' => $image_allow_insecure,
            'Uri' => $image_uri,
            'Cookie' => $image_cookie,
            'Title' => $image_title,
            'Caption' => $image_caption,
            'Hidden' => $image_hidden,
            'FileName' => $image_file_name,
            'Keywords' => $image_keyword,
        ];

        $response = $client->post('album/7Wwsdk!uploadfromuri', $options);
```

And i get this response:

> {""Response"":{""Uri"":""/api/v2/album/7Wwsdk!uploadfromuri"",""UriDescription"":""Upload a photo or video from elsewhere on the web"",""EndpointType"":""UploadFromUri""},""Code"":404,""Message"":""Not Found""}

I did checked that my ""7Wwsdk"" element exists, and is indeed a folder.

I think i'm probably doing something wrong here, as everything else is working but couldn't fint what yet ? Maybe because i'm in local for the development (using Symfony built in local server) ?

Any idea ?

When certain unusual URI queries are passed to phpSmug, we sometimes receive the following error:
> PHP Notice:  Undefined offset: 1 in /vendor/lildude/phpsmug/lib/phpSmug/Client.php on line 139

This is caused when contiguous '&' characters appear in the query statement, effectively creating empty arguments, as seen here between _arg1_ and _arg2_:
> ...?arg1=value1&&arg2=value2

The PHP notice can be corrected by stripping out these empty arguments, by inserting the following at line 137 in _phpsmug/lib/phpSmug/Client.php_, just before the `foreach` loop:
`$pairs = array_diff($pairs,['']);`

Here is the context:
```
# Cater for any args passed in via `?whatever=foo`
if (strpos($url, '?') !== false) {
  $pairs = explode('&', explode('?', $url)[1]);
  $pairs = array_diff($pairs,['']);   // remove empty args caused by adjacent &s in $url
  foreach ($pairs as $pair) {
    list($key, $value) = explode('=', $pair);
    $this->request_options['query'][$key] = $value;
  }
}
```

 I'm sorry I can't formally fork and unit test this right now, although this fix is working in my project.

For example, if I upload ""foo.jpg"", the FileName as stored on the SmugMug site ends up being ""foo.jpg, foo.jpg"".

I believe this is because the X-Smug-Filename header is being duplicated.  In particular, this bit of code:

```
   /* Optional Headers */
    foreach( $args as $arg => $value ) {
        if ( $arg == 'File' ) continue;
        $upload_req->setHeader( 'X-Smug-' . $arg, $value );

will cause X-Smug-FileName to be set a second time.

I changed the code like this:

```
   /* Optional Headers */
    foreach( $args as $arg => $value ) {
        if ( $arg == 'File' ) continue;
        if ( $arg == 'FileName' ) continue;

lildude,phpSmug,https://api.github.com/repos/lildude/phpSmug/issues/14,1856653,MDU6SXNzdWUxODU2NjUz,14,I want to add Authorization Header while accesing the images,237063,closed,FALSE,627280,NA,9,2011-10-09T15:36:19Z,2011-10-15T05:22:54Z,2011-10-15T05:22:54Z,NONE,NA,"Hi, 

I am getting blank images when I try to access the images using   $images = $f->images_get(""AlbumID={$albums['0']['id']}"", ""AlbumKey={$albums['0']['Key']}"", ""Heavy=1""); and I am able to see the image url but it just displays the blank image and the same image url which is accessed through code can be  accessible through browser. 

When I approached the smugmug team they suggested to add the Authorization Header while accessing the images some thing like this 

This is excerpt from Oauth 1.0 soecs regarding authorization header. You should include this header, with your values naturally, to the request for images. 

5.4.1.  Authorization Header

The OAuth Protocol Parameters are sent in the Authorization header the following way:

```
Parameter names and values are encoded per Parameter Encoding.
For each parameter, the name is immediately followed by an ‘=’ character (ASCII code 61), a ‘”’ character (ASCII code 34), the parameter value (MAY be empty), and another ‘”’ character (ASCII code 34).
Parameters are separated by a comma character (ASCII code 44) and OPTIONAL linear whitespace per [RFC2617].
The OPTIONAL realm parameter is added and interpreted per [RFC2617], section 1.2.
```

For example:

```
            Authorization: OAuth realm=""http://sp.example.com/"",
            oauth_consumer_key=""0685bd9184jfhq22"",
            oauth_token=""ad180jjd733klru7"",
            oauth_signature_method=""HMAC-SHA1"",
            oauth_signature=""wOJIO9A2W5mFwDgiDvZbTSMK%2FPY%3D"",
            oauth_timestamp=""137131200"",
            oauth_nonce=""4572616e48616d6d65724c61686176"",
            oauth_version=""1.0""
```

I tried to add this my code as below and my idea is to access the images with header but it is not working. How best we can add the header 

$albums = $f->albums_get('Heavy=false');  
$sig = $f->generate_signature( 'Get', array( 'FileName' => $albums['0']['Key'] ) );
$f->setHeader( 'Authorization', 'OAuth realm=""http://api.smugmug.com/"",
                oauth_consumer_key=""'.$f->APIKey.'"",
                oauth_token=""'.$f->oauth_token.'"",
                oauth_signature_method=""'.$f->oauth_signature_method.'"",
                oauth_signature=""'.urlencode( $sig ).'"",
                oauth_timestamp=""'.$f->oauth_timestamp.'"",
                oauth_version=""1.0"",
                oauth_nonce=""'.$f->oauth_nonce.'""' );
        // Get list of public images and other useful information

I am trying to upload 100 images each of size 3 MB,  When a page is loading, the authentication occurs with the API and upload 10 images at  a time. then there is meta refresh tag added at the bottom of the page to reload for processing the next 10 images. This is the way i implemented to upload the images 10/100 per cycle

Please advise me what did i wrong here?

> ## v4.5.3 - November 18th, 2019
> Bugfixes:
> 
> - fix: add ""no-prototype-builtins"" eslint-rule and fix all occurences - f7f05d7
> - fix: add more properties required to be enumerable - 1988878
> 
> Chores / Build:
> - fix: use !== 0 instead of != 0 - c02b05f
> - add chai and dirty-chai and sinon, for cleaner test-assertions and spies, 
>   deprecate old assertion-methods  - 93e284e, 886ba86, 0817dad, 93516a0
> 
> Security:
> 
> - The properties `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__` and `__lookupGetter__` 
>   have been added to the list of ""properties that must be enumerable"".
>   If a property by that name is found and not enumerable on its parent, 
>   it will silently evaluate to `undefined`. This is done in both the compiled template and the ""lookup""-helper. 
>   This will prevent new Remote-Code-Execution exploits that have been
>   published recently.
> 
> Compatibility notes: 
> 
> - Due to the security-fixes. The semantics of the templates using
>   `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, `__defineSetter__` and `__lookupGetter__` in the respect that those expression now return 
>   `undefined` rather than their actual value from the proto.
> - The semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are  enumerable, as in:
> 
> ```js
> {
>   __proto__: 'some string'
> }
> ```
> 
> - The change may be breaking in that respect, but we still only 
>   increase the patch-version, because the incompatible use-cases
>   are not intended, undocumented and far less important than fixing
>   Remote-Code-Execution exploits on existing systems.

When we pass a text string to `writeText`, it works on every platform/browser except iOS, where it instead copies an empty string (it doesn't just fail to copy, it actually writes an empty string to the clipboard).

I don't have a simple repro to give you, but I debugged this together with a couple of Apple's WebKit engineers at WWDC and wanted to share observations.

The issue occurs in the ""Fallback 1 for desktop Safari"" branch, where it calls `copyUsingTempSelection`.

I think this problem is permissions, which are not supported in Opera clients.
All Opera clients are based on Chromium, but it seems that Chrome is handling those in some other way (probably has own implementation for permissions).

I've tested it on https://garron.net/code/clipboard-polyfill/
What works for Opera Mobile:
* Markup
* DOM node

What doesn't work:
* Plain Text
* Paste Text

As Opera has a quite nice usage on Mobile Phones I think it's worth to consider to add library-support for it.

Just thought I'd share some of my observations.  There is way too much nuance to getting data to the clipboard with the existing, broken APIs.  Thank you for documenting so many of the details!  I wish I'd found your polyfill before finding similar solutions.

1. Chrome crashes with an ""aw snap"" if you try to call e.clipboard.setData(""text/plain"", data) with data.length > 60MB.  Firefox/Edge don't crash.

2. Chrome/FF/Edge have a watchdog timer.  I've measured this at a 1s on Chrome.  Formatting 6MB of ascii text (from an SVG) takes around 30s.  So if you generate an export, pass the string to a hidden textArea, and then select() that.  Ignoring the time to export (which can be many seconds) leaves you with an always failed execCommand('copy') afterwards.

You have to perform the export and setData() calls within the 'copy' listener.  Then the watchdog timer doesn't seem to apply.  So run execCommand as quickly as possible, then take your time.

3. Formatting a hidden text area with 100MB takes around 100s.  This freezes up the browser while this happens, and users think the web app has crashed. 

There doesn't seem to be a way to:
  a. can't provide progress 
      the export and setData have to occur in the listener, 
      anything else gets killed by the watchdog timer
  b. can't use setTimeout (or it's no longer user-initiated)
  c. can't defer evaluation of clipboard data until client paste
     (key to apps on OSX/Windows/Linux)

The problem is that inside the click event listener I call the function that perform the AJAX request but the returned data are processed inside a callback function (ajax success) that is no more inside the original click event listener, thus the copy fails.
The only walk around that make copy works is to make the ajax call synchronous (async: false jQuery option).

The callback would specify whether the to overwrite the data on the clipboard event, and with what.
Ideally, we would pass a parameter to the callback to tell them if the event was user-initiated, but I don't think there's a nice way to do this without e.g. swizzling `document.execCommand` (Fields like `event.isTrusted` don't help.)

Should the callback be synchronous?

- A synchronous callback allows us to modify `event.clipboardData` in the event listener itself.
- A synchronous event listener does not allow the callback to make asynchronous calculations.
- In some browsers, synchronous modification of `event.clipboardData` may be buggy.
- In some browsers, we may be able to trigger `document.execCommand()` an additional time, either inside the initial handler, or using `setTimeout()`. This may be buggy in different situations.

### 什么是hack？
行业中存在各种浏览器，典型的浏览器包括 IE 、火狐、谷歌等等；同样种类的浏览器，也存在着不同的版本，如  IE6、IE7…等。
不同浏览器对 CSS 解析机制并不是完全相同，因此会导致不同浏览器中，页面的效果各不相同。
此时可以针对某种浏览器进行样式设置，从而达到所有浏览器显示的效果一致，这种标识不同浏览器的方法就是 hack
简单地说就是可以通过 hack 技术，只针对某一种或几种浏览器进行样式设置.

However, HTML5 standards say that attributes can be written even without quotes, but it should be mentioned that they are recommended because of stricter languages like XHTML demand quotes.
Sometimes it is necessary to use quotes. This example will not display the title attribute correctly, because it contains a space:
``<p title=About W3Schools>``
Double quotes around attribute values are the most common in HTML, but single quotes can also be used.
In some situations, when the attribute value itself contains double quotes, it is necessary to use single quotes:

The Code Guide reads: 

> Don’t omit optional closing tags (e.g. </li> or </body>).

I think it would be good to either give a very good reason or otherwise remove this statement. The HTML 5.1 (and probably the previous ones) explicitly say the closing tags are not necessary in certain precise circumstances, and even give examples of HTML code where the implicit closings tags are not written. I am not aware of them recommending against this practice, it rather looks like they are encouraging it since they do omit them in some code examples (although some other code snippets of the specification do not omit optional closing tags).
Besides, this makes the code lighter and much easier to read. Just compare the two:
```
…
<tr>
  <th>Price in 2017
  <td>78,50
  <td>79,50
  <td>82,50
  <td>86,00
  <td>107,50
  <td>87,00
  <td>100,00
  <td>90,50
  <td>90,50
  <td>82,00
  <td>88,00
  <td>99,00
<tr>
…
```
With the closing tags: 
```
…
<tr>
  <th>
    Price in 2017
  </th>
  <td>
    78,50
  </td>
  <td>
    79,50
  </td>
  <td>
    82,50
  </td>
  <td>
    86,00
  </td>
  <td>
    107,50
  </td>
  <td>
    87,00
  </td>
  <td>
    100,00
  </td>
  <td>
    90,50
  </td>
  <td>
    90,50

  <td>

  <td>

  <td>

Now I know that I am not obliged to put the content of the `td` elements on a new line, but if I had HTML elements nested inside `td` elements (which I do on several of my projects), I would have to anyway.

The declaration order says [“Box-model” comes first](https://github.com/mdo/code-guide/blob/dabd68d00bd8f10f588c3aec986a7c8776f68831/_includes/css/declaration-order.css#L10), and [“Visual” later on](https://github.com/mdo/code-guide/blob/dabd68d00bd8f10f588c3aec986a7c8776f68831/_includes/css/declaration-order.css#L22). This is cool. Nothing to say on the sorting.

What surprises me is to find `border` in the “Visual” section, when it is part of the box-model.

I've code guide, and also searched it using the term ""mixin"", but have not found any guidance on this topic yet. Given that there's other Less and Sass remarks I've assumed it's at least worth considering adding preprocessor-specific guidance.

I appreciate this can be hard, as I can already off the bat think of several different situations:
1. **Single Property**. Mixins to DRY up variables. E.g.:
   
   ```
   @mixin deep-shadow($color) {
       box-shadow: 2px 2px 4px $color, -2px -2px 4px $color;
   }
   ```
2. **Single Property, vendor prefixes**. Mixins that are semantically one thing, but solve cross-browser things. E.g.
   
   ```
   @mixin border-radius($radius) {
       -webkit-border-radius: $radius;
          -moz-border-radius: $radius;
           -ms-border-radius: $radius;
               border-radius: $radius;
   }
   ```
3. **Multiple Properties**. Mixins that combine multiple properties in a logical group. E.g.:
   
   ```
   @mixin prime-floaty-boat() {
       display: inline-block;
       float: right;
       width: 200px;
       height: 100px;
       background-color: pink;
       border-color: gold;
       box-shadow: 2px 2px 4px #faa;
       opacity: 1;
   }
   ```

And there's probably others I forgot?

I guess **options 1 and 2** can be placed where the actual property would go, even though with most syntax highlighting styles that might be visually offputting (at least to me).

**Option 3** (and other complex options I forgot about) is a bit harder. Should it be placed where the _first_ property would appear? In the ""Misc"" section? Or at the start?

Note: I'm a Sass user, and not very familiar with Less. I've assumed, perhaps erronously, that they are highly similar in this regard. Perhaps someone more knowledgeable can chime in on this?

http://codehunt.io/sub/code-guide-by-mdo/

**TL;DR** Code Hunt helps programmers discover and discuss awesome code.  

This pull-request adds a ""vote"" badge to your README.md:   

[![CodeHunt.io](https://img.shields.io/badge/vote-codehunt.io-02AFD1.svg)](http://codehunt.io/sub/code-guide-by-mdo/?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge)   

I _really_ respect your work @mdo, and totally understand if you reject this PR. I figured I would submit it on the off chance that you might add the badge just for today, then remove it tomorrow - but I know you're crazy busy so if you just want to flat out ignore this PR that's totally cool.

Happy coding!

I think this is meant to say that the whole HTML document (or all documents?) should appear written by the same person, however it implies that only each individual line should appear written by the same person.

I.e. each line could have a different standard, but as long as each line appears written by the same person it's ok.

I'd suggest changing it to something like this: 

""Every line of code in your HTML documents should appear to be written by the same person, no matter the number of contributors.""

But there are non-perf-related reasons to avoid them too, right? Like why we're trying to avoid them in Bootstrap going forward?
e.g. They're unnecessarily constraining in some cases. Maybe my component uses an `h2` today, but tomorrow I might want it to use an `h4` instead, so it's annoying if the component's CSS relies on this aspect of the DOM.

A note about the 'IE compatibility mode' section. It's a great idea to include it, however, in order for this tag to work as you expect, it needs to come before all other elements in the `<head>` excluding the `<title>` and other `<meta>` elements.  Unfortunately, the location of the tag totally changes the behavior.

I really like your this project since its good to have some well-known standards when developing web applications and I would like to contribute.

You write on your website that for every contribution, an issue should be open... I would like to translate your project into Czech since there are few well structured guidelines in my language. Is it ok if I do so?

I often run into problems when describing the content of a CSS file and until a couple years ago I didn't know most of these terms by heart either. Documenting the most common ones with examples seems like a good idea, but it's a lot of new content.

Here's how it looks currently with just a few items stubbed out:

![Nomenclature](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/98681/2338786/767c46b2-a4ad-11e3-87f3-dcd4108c579b.png)

Some things I'd like feedback on:
- Should nomenclature be it's own section, split from the main HTML and CSS ones? Perhaps as a glossary?
- What level of detail is too much? Should we do into every type of selector?
- Is there another format that would serve this better?

When JavaScript is disabled, the buttons don't work at all.

I think that adding progressive enhancement would be a good idea.

The code would consist of two parts:
* A link e.g. `<a class=""gh-button"" href=""https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap"" data-type=""star"" data-size=""large"" data-count=""true"">Star twbs/bootstrap on GitHub</a>`
* A script e.g. `<script src=""https://ghbtns.com/buttons.js"" async></script>`

And here is how the progressive enhancement would work:

* If JavaScript is disabled in your browser, the link would be used as a fallback.
* If JavaScript is enabled in your browser, the script will first detect if your browser supports shadow DOM. Shadow DOM is a replacement for iframes that is faster than iframes.
    * If the browser you're using doesn't support shadow DOM, then all links with the `.gh-button` class would be read by the script and replaced with iframes.
    * If the browser you're using supports shadow DOM, than all links with the `.gh-button` class would be read by the script and replaced with shadow DOMs.

Code scanning looks for vulnerabilities, such as XSS, SQL injection, etc., in your code. If it finds any new vulnerabilities it surfaces them in the PR as check annotations, and blocks the build until they’re fixed or marked as false positives. If it finds any on the repo’s default branch it displays them in the [security tab](../security/code-scanning).

For now you also need to be feature flagged individually to see results in the security tab (as well as having write permission on this repo) - if you drop an email to jhutchings1@github.com I can get anyone you need added.

---

Highlights:

- **NEW**: Added sponsor button (pass `type=sponsor`)
- **NEW**: Updated the font stack to a more modern one
- **BREAKING**: Dropped ancient CSS vendor prefixes and IE < 10 support; the button will still work on IE9, but it won't look perfect, IE < 9 no longer works.
- **ENHANCEMENT**: Reduced filesize: approximately **-20%** off the uncompressed github-btn.html's size (6849 -> 5419 bytes)
- **ENHANCEMENT**: When `count=true` is not passed, we now don't make any GitHub API request which should significantly improve page load times

---

- Improved button's accessibility:
  - counter is hidden with `aria-hidden` if it's empty
  - a title is added in the `iframe`
- Improve button's HTML
  - add `doctype`
  - add `lang`
  - add `charset`
  - add `rel=""noopener noreferrer""` for external links
  - remove `aria-label` since we set it via JS
- Improve button's CSS:
  - the embedded SVG is no longer base64-encoded (-45% off the uncompressed SVG)
  - the embedded SVG is optimized with SVGO (approximately -25% off the compressed SVG, -28% off the uncompressed SVG)
  - the CSS is streamlined
- Improved button's JS:
  - we no longer make unneeded GitHub API calls, for example if you don't pass `query=true`
  - add a few fail-safe checks
  - switched to `Node.textContent` since we weren't adding HTML
  - wrap the code in an IIFE so that the minifier mangles the variables properly
  - switch to strict mode
- Build:
  - it should be generally easier to work on the project locally; `npm i && bundle i` to get started
  - replace gulp with npm scripts
  - add CSS/Sass linting with Stylelint
  - and JS linting with xo
  - add a watch script
  - update Jekyll to v4.0.0
  - add CI for tests and docs deployments
- Docs:
  - the docs are HTML5 valid
  - the docs are WCAG2AA valid
  - add `link rel=canonical`
  - add `meta generator` tag
  - switch to Sass
  - inline the docs CSS

TODO:

- [x] Update Sponsors URL
- [x] Replace follower count with sponsors count, if possible, or drop the count
- [x] Update colors and fonts to match latest of GitHub
- [x] Adjust docs a bit to incorporate the above
- [x] Mention more of the changes in the changelog above and remove references to PRs since most of the patches have changed since the PRs
- [x] Adapt docs iframes width (check macOS)
- [x] Reduce docs sponsor iframes width
- [x] Fix ToC tap targets being too close (maybe adding padding/margin should do it)
- [x] Add a `PERSONAL_TOKEN` secret in the repo for deployments to work

I made my own version of this that I use on my github pages. It only has support for the Star button with the large size. The only thing you can customize is the repo.

- https://github.com/stefansundin/superf4/blob/gh-pages/js/github-btn.coffee

Then add the button like this:
- https://github.com/stefansundin/superf4/blob/gh-pages/_includes/footer.html
- `site.github_repo` is `stefansundin/superf4` in this case.

Example:
- https://stefansundin.github.io/superf4/#credits

Just want to put this here in case anyone wants to copy it.

This takes #48 and fixes a few things:
- Watching is now pointing to subscribers from the API, not the stargazers/watchers values
- Stars properly uses stargazers counts
- Removes a stargazers count function
- Cleans up the display of the page

Should be good to go, I think. I'll mark this as v2 once merged. My only concern is folks who have used `watch` to previously mean Star. They'll have to change all their embeds, and that's not so good.

Thoughts?

One such affected project is @stolksdorf's [Parallax JS demo page](http://stolksdorf.github.com/Parallaxjs), so you can head over there (at the moment) to see this redirect in action. (PS, heads up @stolksdorf!)

Though this is obviously something that @github is doing intentionally to avoid people serving framed github pages, in this particular instance it appears to break the websites of anyone who is using github-buttons in their blog or project site, etc, and hasn't yet updated the URL to refer to ghbtns.com.  I'm not sure if the solution here is more evangelism about the URL change, or putting up the old GH pages again, or something else, but I just figured I'd drop in to let you know that at the moment, there are some really averse affects for anyone who uses the project and hasn't updated in the last month.

This is a really small change. Here's the idea: I'm working on my personal site, and think I'll have audiences that are interested in checking out the code behind a project but aren't super-familiar with github and/or don't want to watch the repository. Since all the ""watch"" button really does is take a user to a repository's page, I added a 4th type of button with the same functionality whose text instead reads ""View Source on GitHub."" I think that might make it more friendly to casual audiences. Let me know what you think, and if you like it I'll send the same pull request on gh-pages and update the docs.

I propose to provide a <code>Uri.encodeQueryComponent</code> in the following method of class <code>Response</code>:

```
Response cookie(String name, String val, [Map options]) {
    var cookie = new Cookie(
             Uri.encodeQueryComponent(name),
             Uri.encodeQueryComponent(value),
     );

     final cookieMirror = reflect(cookie);

    if (options != null) {
      options.forEach((option, value) {
        cookieMirror.setField(new Symbol(option), value);
      });
    }

    _response.cookies.add(cookie);
    return this;
  }
```

Also a <code>Uri.decodeQueryComponent</code> should be made in the <code>cookies</code> getter of <code>HttpRequest</code>.

For example like this:

```
  List<Cookie> get cookies {
      return _request.cookies.map((Cookie c) {
        c.name = Uri.decodeQueryComponent(c.name);
        c.value = Uri.decodeQueryComponent(c.value);
        return c;
     });
  }

}).animate({  
    translate : [-10,0,0],  // back to origin
    duration: 500

and then later, responding to some event, I want to move the whole object a defined distance to the right, without the left-right wiggle ever stopping:

<pre>
myButton.onclick = function() {
  myObject.animate({

This doesn't work right now:

Instead, the ball goes careening off the screen. Re-expressing the wiggle in parallel at the time of the second call doesn't fix things, either:

<pre>
ball.stop().animate([{  
   translate : [100,0,0],  // to the right
   duration: 1000

}]);

(This is also throwing an error because the stop method isn't chainable as it stands, another issue.)

I think it's pretty clear that the existing behavior isn't useful in any real world context. My sense is that the cleanest solution might be to add an argument to the animate function, specifying whether it adds to existing animations or overwrites them.

First, about the docs:

1) How about some clarification in the docs on why to choose js versus css worlds, other than client support?

2) How about a browser support chart?

3) Why don't you use semicolons in your demonstration code?  I don't mean to start a debate here, but it really helps make your code accessible, especially to beginners. (At the very least, it's necessary for minification.)

4) A few typos:

should be

""transformations’ values are relative to the last known Item state, its initial state..."" (no apostrophe)

""You can call .infinite() at the end of you .animate’s chain,""
