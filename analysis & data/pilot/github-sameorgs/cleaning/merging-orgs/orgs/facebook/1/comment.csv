Thanks for your reply.  I ended up switiching my emulator to Snes9x, tested my roms and they work.  For some reasone Retroarch failed on me, wouldnt even recognize the roms.

Ice recognizes everything, including the Roms. When I load up steam, the roms are there, however, still get shortcut failed but now I get a windows popup to select the rom, when I do on my comp it loads rom.  so the issue is getting the short cut to launch the rom so i can play it on steamlink.

Attached it a screenshot of the properties for one of the roms to try and figure out where the error is and if I have to manually fix each shortcut.

You just extract the contents of its zip archive to a folder and run it from there. So, you have it as installed as it can be.

I'm guessing you edited the [Steam] section of the config.txt file. I would first try leaving that entire section commented out (put the ""#"" in front of each line in the section) so that Ice ignores it. That part of my config.txt is commented out and it works fine. It seems that Ice already has a pretty good idea of where to look for Steam. If you do REALLY need to use that section, if it cannot find your Steam directory, then it looks to me like you mistyped the directory location.

1.  Windows computers use the backslash (""\"") for file paths.
2.  I'm not sure about case sensitivity, but I always specify file paths on all operation systems with exact case sensitivity, so unless you changed something, yourself, ""program files"", ""steam"", and probably the drive letter ""c:"" should all be title capped.

So the file path it is trying to access should read ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam..."" (ignore the ellipses ""..."")

I also don't know why after ""steam"" it then switches to double backslashes. I'm assuming that's all added on by Ice and would work if the section of the path up through ""steam"" were corrected. But if you did type that whole file path in, I'd be curious where you entered it and why you used double backslashes.

Saw a topic where someone had the same issue and fixed it by changing a slight error in the txt files, apparently a # was missing, however I can't seem to find the problem in my txt files.

I don't know if this will help, but prior to this issue Ice could not find any of my emulators, and only downloaded grid images, once I switched to retroarch it closes by itself the moment I open it up

here is my txt. files

p.s it creates ROMs file at C:\Users\Firas\ROMs even though I have given it another directory.

# The path to place your ROMs Directory. This can be in any drive or anywhere,

# as long as the full path is specified. Use ~ to represent your home folder

# (for example, C:\Users\Scott)

#

# Set a directory where the ROMs are stored.

# If no directory is provided, ""~/ROMs"" is used.

[Grid Images]

# The website listed should provide the grid images used by Ice. This URL will

# most likely need to be provided by the website itself, as it is fairly specific.

# The default is ConsoleGrid (consolegrid.com/api/top_picture)

This is my first time ever working with python, but I feel like I should be able to figure this out. The error obviously states that it cannot find the `pysteam 1.0.0-beta2` package. So, I figured I could just install it myself by cloning `https://github.com/scottrice/pysteam` and running `python setup.py install`. Terminal seemed to do some stuff, so I'm guessing it installed the pysteam package. Tried re-installing the `Ice` project and, unfortunately, it yielded the same error message.

`Could not find suitable distribution for Requirement.parse('pysteam==1.0.0-beta2')`

I found this error message in [a discussion on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/3yipkk/rsteam_weekly_community_support_thread/cyee7tv) and they suggested editing `requirements.txt` to the following (I used `sudo nano requirements.txt` from the cloned directory):

`appdirs==1.2.0
pastebin==1.1.0
psutil==2.1.1
pysteam>=1.0.0-b1`

The only notable change was the last line that defines the requirement for `pysteam`. After making this change, I was able to go back and complete the install of the Ice project's setup script. I ended up getting a permissions error when actually running the Ice program, but the setup did complete.

Because of my unfamiliarity with python, I'm not sure if this is a change that should make it into the master. Seems like the `>=` should automatically get the latest version instead of hard-coding a specific one, right?

Open `cmd.exe`, `cd` into the directory with Ice, and run `Ice.exe pdebug`. Alternatively, you can right click on `Ice.exe`, hit ""Create Shortcut"", then on the resulting shortcut right click and hit ""Properties"", and under ""Target"" where it says `C:\Path\to\Ice.exe` just add `pdebug` afterwards (so it says `C:\Path\to\Ice.exe pdebug`). Then you can double click the shortcut instead.

Anyway, from looking at what you've posted so far, it looks like you have your consoles/emulators set up correctly (we can see that Ice has detected them and mapped them), so my guess is that its having trouble actually finding any of your ROMs. Can you explain to me what your ROMs directory looks like? You mention its `D:\Steam ROMs`. Inside there should be a subdirectory for every console (in this case, an `NES`, a `Gamecube`, and a `PS2` directory), what are the contents of those directories?

Is this the goal of the task, to put them in a location thats writable? Ah, that makes sense, since you guys are bundling Ice its probably sitting in a read only directory right now isnt it.

That seems totally fine to me, although if you guys dont have a preference then I think I will probably put them in `paths.application_data_directory()`, which (if I understand the `appdirs` module correctly) would cause it to be places in `~/.local/share/Ice`. Does that seem reasonable to you?

Your commit references pastebin module additions, but I don't see code to write logs to an area that the steam user can reach. I would say logs should be written to a central location users can get to, not in the running directory as it still seems above.

Be careful though - the reason this check exists is because Steam writes its shortcuts.vdf file on close, so if Ice is run while Steam is open when Steam closes (which will need to happen to view shortcuts) it will overwrite anything you did.

On the other hand, one of the big features that I REALLY want to add is to allow you to update Ice from Steam. Like, you have a shortcut which is basically ""Run Ice"" that will close Steam, run Ice to sync your shortcuts, then open Steam again. I have a feeling that running //after being launched from Steam// will present its own challenges - I doubt I can just close Steam while running a Steam shortcut, but I have nothing to back that thought up and havent investigated at all. Still, in the meantime I bet I can figure out how to make Ice automatically stop and restart Steam.

The skip steam check is great, which i'll have to run some tests on. If the Ice shortcuts then go away if ran while Steam is open, then closes, we won't likely use it, but it is _very_ useful for testing, so I appreciate it from a debug standpoint.

You're right that I removed `src/ice.py` in order to rearrange my code structure. The new way of running it (as @futurepr0n alluded to) is `python -m ice`. I commited f415c277f4bff03cec1dfa21eb9af0e85b39ca1f to fix the issue.

For @andrewowen, thats actually an issue with pysteam that I fixed for my work locally but which I hadn't pushed to Github. I just pushed 6878314668b23e1b21eaf6ef21a24d51107ed100 to fix that though, so if you run `python setup.py install` again then you should be able to run Ice as normal.

I included my config files for reference and you may want to symlink your rom directory to somewhere where the path will not contain spaces (I keep mine in my Google Drive folder and thus the normal path always contains spaces so it is symlinked to the root of my C: drive)

As for a breakdown of what all is changed in case scott wants to implement any as all my changes help any users that like to use underscores instead of spaces and will have no impact on users that use spaces:

Line 46 in rom.py is changed to 
appname = str(self.prefixed_name()).replace(""_"", "" "") 
so that the name displayed in steam is devoid of any underscores

After line 42 in local_provider.py
      filename = rom.name.replace('_', ' ') + extension
      path = os.path.join(img_dir, filename)
      if os.path.isfile(path):
        return path
So that the search for local images is run both with and without underscores incase people went back and forth about using underscores. This change could be made to the console grid provider but is unnecessary since their search algorithm already accounts for this.

Lastly I implemented a TODO I found so that the data directory is the same place as the setup.py (One above the working directory) so that that way your config files do not have to be in that location in your app data. Line 36 in configuration.py is changed to
        path = os.getcwd()
        path, src = path.rsplit('\', 1)
        path = str(path)
        return path

Any questions feel free to ask. 

As a bonus I built to script that will change all spaces for underscores  for you recursively down in whatever directory you give this as a command line argument for this .bat file which can be found here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9REw3RFcAtgUk1OeDVRRHZlRlE/view?usp=sharing

And if the word recursive did not scare you (If it did then dont worry about this section) as a warning careful how you run it. I keep mine in my rom directory and as a precaution it will not just run you will have to run it from command line and give it the argument of the path that you want it to run in (ROM directory). I would never run it in admin mode and of course it can not be undone (Well it could undo most of it but would then get rid of any underscores if you ran it again in reverse). Do not hold me accountable if you screw something up with that because you stumbled upon this in a google search and do not know what you are doing

This has actually already been fixed in the current source of Ice (which means if you dont want to delete the `anonymous` folder you can always just run that), but the `.exe` file was built before the fix went in so it still has this bug.

At first I was considering just modifying the current system to work as you described in your example. This has a couple problems though, like what happens if the nicknames don't match up? Plus there is the issue that every time I expected to get a single value for something (like 'nickname') I could instead get a list of values. This would require a pretty decently sized architecture change to Ice.

After contemplating it a bit more, I think the real issue here is that _consoles.txt mixes information about how the ROMs are **displayed** with how they are **executed**_. It feels weird to have an option like 'icon' in the same file as an option like 'extensions'. I think what really needs to happen here is a third configuration file, one that describes some way of finding files (a directory, extensions, whitelist, etc). These files can then be associated with an emulator used to play them and a console used to display them.

My one worry here is that we are adding more complexity to the app. I already feel pretty ridiculous that I am asking people to go and hand-modify two different configuration files. I think this task will have to wait until after I make a GUI for Ice.

You will need to run `python setup.py install` first though, and unfortunately there is a bug right now that means you need to have py2exe installed if you want to run that command on Windows. I'm working on fixing it, but it will take me a while. So that leaves three options:

1) Install py2exe. This will let you run `python setup.py install` without a problem and you can run Ice.
2) Wait for me to fix the py2exe bug, which will let you run the source.
3) Wait for me to make another executable.

Those are basically in order of how quickly they will happen too. 1 you can do yourself ([download link](http://sourceforge.net/projects/py2exe/files/py2exe/0.6.9/py2exe-0.6.9.win32-py2.7.exe/download)), 2 and 3 should happen in a week or so.

Edit: Randomly on the 2nd or 3rd try it worked (after waiting a couple of minutes), but i can't reproduce it, and i have like 2 entries of each game now.

Edit 2: I removed all the rom/iso folder, and ran the old (Executable) version of ICE, which removed the old games, then did the same with the new python src/ice.py thingie, and apparently deleted the others.
I launched Steam, and confirmed all games were gone, closed it and ran python src/ice.py again, which added all the games (with their respective icons, custom images and folders) pretty much instantly. 
Thanks for the help Scott, kinda messy but that did the trick, I'm leaving my solutions in case someone gets the same problem.

Edit 3: i have to run the old ICE version to remove the old games if i want to run the python version and not get stuck. Also some consoles it adds the custom images (on my pc) super fast, while others it takes a good 30sec per image, still looking forward to the new executable :)

Also, how feaseable would it be to add the feature to add the backdrop image you get when you take a screenshot automatically from the same image packs, like this:

Could you make an equivalent issue on that repo? http://github.com/scottrice/pysteam/issues

As for the issue itself, I consider that out of the scope of Ice. Ice has one job - to add your ROMs as playable games. Library organization should be handled somewhere else.

That being said I've been thinking for a while that a general library-management tool for Steam could be useful. Things like automatically adding banners to games that you mark as 'played' or adding/removing tags from large numbers of games at once. That will have to be another project though, I want to keep Ice focused. On the bright side the code for the difficult problems I had to solve for Ice (reading/writing `shortcuts.vdf` and setting grid images for non-Steam games) all exists in pysteam, so theoretically it should be pretty straightforward to build on top of that.

It doesn't go and find special icons for every game in the same way it does grid images (mainly because there isn't nearly as much artwork out there for game specific icons and its pretty low visibility), but it does let you set custom icons for games of a given console. So all of your Gamecube games would have the same icon, all of your SNES games would have the same icon, etc.

To do that, there is actually just a field in consoles.txt that you can use. Just set

```
icon=C:\path\to\icon.png

I'm assuming the issue here is that `retroarch` is not a file that exists in the current directory, but it is something that resolves when you use the `$PATH` variable.

So the quick fix for you would be to use `location=/usr/bin/retroarch` (or whatever the absolute path to retroarch actually is). For Ice I need to make it resolve paths using the `$PATH` variable, but before I do I need to make sure Steam would understand it.

Are you running the .exe file or the source code? If its the source, then a backup should exist. Unfortunately that functionality isn't in the current exe file I think.

Anyway, on to your actual problem. It seems like you have a Genesis game that has a special character in the name. A common one that gets people is the é in Pokémon, although I doubt that is the case for a Genesis game. Either way, take a look at your library and see if you find something that stands out to you.

Once you have removed that character give Ice another go and see if it works.

As for deleting the shortcuts file, that should definitely not happen. I imagine it has to do with the path again, Ice saved some path to the shortcuts.vdf file and then couldn't read it the next time. Probably was a garbage character too which made Steam unable to parse the file. Overall bad times, this is definitely something I need to look into.

The issue is that ConsoleGrid relies on the nickname of your console, and if its something it doesn't understand it will stop Ice.

The easiest way to fix it is to change the nickname in consoles.txt to the one that ConsoleGrid expects. For Playstation 2, that would be `PS2`. Super Nintendo is `SNES` and Gameboy Advance is `GBA`.

Try changing the nicknames of your consoles and see if it works.

Basically, if you have a console in your `consoles.txt` that ConsoleGrid doesn't know about Ice will just halt. I know, its terrible, its a side effect of a well-intentioned change.

Unfortunately the only way to deal with it right now is to remove that console from `consoles.txt`. The source of Ice has a fix for this issue (if ConsoleGrid complains Ice just skips the ROM as opposed to stopping), but running the source isn't as easy as it used to be. If you want to give it a shot let me know and I can try to help you debug, but I will hopefully be putting up an updated .exe file in the near future so you could also wait for that.

They are used by ConsoleGrid to figure out which system you want your images for (so that if you have a game named `Zelda` in your NES folder ConsoleGrid won't give you back an image for `Zelda II - The Adventures of Link`). Unfortunately there is a bug with ConsoleGrid right now that will throw an error when it doesn't understand the nickname you have entered, and Ice misunderstands that as thinking that ConsoleGrid is down

To fix your issue, replace your nicknames with what ConsoleGrid thinks they should be. Luckily you are only using Consoles that exist on the site, so it shouldn't be too bad. You can find the nicknames that ConsoleGrid is expecting by going to http://consolegrid.com and clicking on the `Consoles` link up top. The text that comes after the `-` is the nickname.

To save you the trouble though, this is what your `consoles.txt` should look like

The problem is that I require users to manually enter commands, which means I need to take steps to help them avoid simple mistakes. Unfortunately that means putting quotes around the rom names, since any sane program would expect it.

My plan is to no longer ask the user to provide the command, and instead get them from a central repository somewhere (that I would most likely manage). Until that happens though, we are stuck with this.

I realize none of this helps fix your immediate problem, but I had the same issue when I set up Project64, so I wrote a tiny little program that just takes a ROM file (with quotes) and opens Project64 on the same file (without quotes). You can find it [here](https://github.com/scottrice/Steam-Emulator-Launchers/tree/master/Windows/Project64). To set this up, drop the executable into the same directory as `Project64.exe`, then change your `emulators.txt` for Project64 entry from `location=C:\Path\to\Project64.exe` to `location=C:\Path\to\Project64-launcher.exe`.

Steam is weird in that I have seen both missing shortcuts.vdf files and shortcuts.vdf files with no shortcuts in them. My guess would be that a fresh Steam install starts with no shortcuts.vdf file, and then as soon as you add a single shortcut the file is created and never leaves.

Either way, the latest commit should fix the issue. Let us know if you have any more problems.

I also just tried setting a custom image for one of my steam games, which changed the image in grid view on the host PC, but this change did not show in the library on the steam os device. I rebooted the steam os device after this change as well, just to verify it didn't need a reboot/relaunch to pull the image.

I'm thinking the way it is set up through steam is that each device uses its' own grid image/icon settings, so in order to get this working I'm probably going to need to download the grid images on the steam OS device and then set each one manually inside Steam OS. 

Not really seeing another way to do this unless steam supports UNC path for image graphics. If it did, might be able to set something like:
\PCNAME\grid-images\grid-image-tile.png

Of course, that's assuming that the 'host' steam computer is communicating the image path to the 'client' steam os device at all. Which probably isn't the case =.

I've also been having issues getting xbox 360 controls streamed to any emulator aside from PPPSP (though that really doesn't have anything to do with Ice :D)

Steam lets you manually assign custom grid view images to streamed-only games from a client side, so there should be a way to access that in the code.

Ah, interesting. I have a theory on how this is working, and if I'm right then it should be totally doable to set grid images from a client machine. I won't elaborate too much more though because I haven't looked into it at all and I'm really just guessing.

The bigger problem is - how do I get Ice on the client to know about the Ice that is running on the server? Ice wasn't really meant to handle that use case. I could provide a way to keep Ice running in the background and provide an API for a client to read the list of games (and even the images from the host!)  but connecting the client Ice to the server Ice will be hard.

Once I get a streaming box of my own set up I'll try to work on some basic support for Steam In Home Streaming.

For Ice to correctly sync ROMs, it has to figure out which shortcuts in Steam are managed by Ice and which aren't. In the exe, it just checks to see if a shortcut references the ROMs directory to figure out whether Ice was the one who made it. I think Ice is getting confused  because there were PC games in the same directory. The good news is that the source code shouldn't have this problem, as Ice is stricter about which directories it checks now. Instead of looking just for the ROMs directory, it checks for either `ROMs/SNES` or `ROMs/PS2`, so your games in `ROMs/PC` wont be confused so long as you don't have a console named `PC`.

Since the issues are fixed in the source, I am going to close the issue, but if you have any more questions about running from source feel free to post here.

Specifically, you just have to add an `images directory` option to the console you want, and Ice will check that directory for custom banners before it goes to consolegrid. The banners need to be named the same thing as the ROM.

So, for example, it might look like this:

```
C:\
 | Games
   | Super Nintendo
     | ROMs
       | Mega Man X.sfc
     | Images
       | Mega Man X.png

# consoles.txt
[Super Nintendo]
nickname=SNES
roms directory=C:\Games\Super Nintendo\ROMs
images directory=C:\Games\Super Nintendo\Images
```

With the above setup, Ice should add `Mega Man X` to Steam, and should use `Mega Man X.png` as the grid image

Thegamesdb does a much better job of organizing games by their platforms than consolegrid does. Unfortunately thegamesdb doesn't support steam banners. Steam requires images to be a very specific size (460x215), and thegamesdb doesn't have a section to upload just steam banners.

I was in contact with the owner of the site a while ago to work on making this a reality, but I haven't heard from him in a couple months. If that functionality gets added to thegamesdb then I will definitely move Ice over.

But I've been working on getting the latest version of Higan working with Ice. 
Higan **needs** to have the folder containing the Super Nintendo Roms named _""Super Famicom""_ and Ice **needs** it to be named _""SNES""_ (in order for ConsoleGrid to work). After carefully editing the names of the Higan generated "",sfc"" folders so that ConsoleGrid will recognize their names, AND generating a folder filled with the same .sfc's as files instead of folders. The only way to get them to play nice now, is to run Ice with the \SNES*someNameHere*.sfc files, then delete the folder and files, and create a Symbolic directory link from "".\SNES\"" to "".\Super Famicom\"".

I decided to invest my afternoon into this and got it working from the Steam Forum link.

Biggest issue was around what directories to set the variables in the python script too (latest script here: http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=XFWnf5W4)

Key considerations:
- mame.ini for Mame64.exe has correct `romdir` setting, so test mame64 itself is working and finding roms
- ICE rom directory should be different to your MAME rom directory, so it can create some folders for itself
- Run ICE after you've updated the console.txt and emulator.txt files, this will create relevant folders for below points
- python script: set `rompath` to the same directory as `romdir` in mame.ini
- python script: set `linkpath` to the directory ""Arcade"" created inside ICE's Rom directory
- python script: `mamepath` and `mameexe` are self explainatory

This is not an ideal script, but can confirm it does work.

The second case is the one that is giving your problems, as the way Ice determines whether a ROM has been 'deleted' (since it cant tell if the file ever existed at all) is to look at the target string and see if it looks like something Ice would generate. If it does, and the file doesnt exist there anymore, Ice will get rid of it. This logic has given people issues in the past, so I am curious of your thoughts on how to go forward.

The way I see it, there are two options:

1) Don't delete games that Ice has added.
2) Figure out some better way of telling that a file was deleted. I'm open to ideas on how to do this one.

I've made some progress.  Games are now populating in steam. The emulators aren't launching the games though. I'm using the presets defined in http://scottrice.github.io/Ice/emulators/
I""m assuming it's a command line argument problem perhaps, but those emulators all work outside of steam so that is another issue I'll put aside.

It's just as you thought, and it makes perfect sense, you need to do it from the steam account.

Here is what I had to do, there could be an easier way but this was what I did;
This is all assuming you've manually added the debian repositories back to sources.list so you can apt-get the desired emulators.

After you've run post_logon.sh The system should restart, you may get a boot error, if so just restart, the next boot should take you into Big Picture Mode.

Go to settings and under interface options; enable linux desktop. 

Choose exit/power options and exit to the desktop.

Open a terminal window, you need to login as root and then do the following;

nano /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf

scroll down to where is says ""user-session=steamos"" and change it to ""#user-session=steamos"" 

under it find ""autologin-user=steam"" and change it to ""#autologin-user=steam""

You will have to go past the entry that says #autologin-user= to see it

Close the file with ctrl-x and save it

Enter the command;
service lightdm restart

The system should either go black or glitch out an then go black with a blinking text cursor.

ctrl alt del to reboot.

When it comes back up you should have a login screen. change the session to gnome, enter steam as the user name (there should be no password for it.

From this point as long as ice is configured correctly it should work without any problem.
You just need to go nano into lightdm.conf again as root and remove the pound signs that were added , do another lightdm service restart and reboot.

At the very least all the games ice could find should be listed, and as long as the command arguments in emulators.txt are correct. the shortcuts should allow the games to launch. Though I am having trouble with that at the moment, i believe it's a command argument issue, and nothing to do with ice.

Pour the champagne, play the Final Fantasy Victory Fanfare, do a dance.

Edit:  As a side note;  I did not know linux outside of a GUI before I started working with SteamOS and ICE and I've had to spend a lot of that time in the terminal or console.  It has been interesting and I'm quite pleased at having learned something new.

I had trouble with artwork at first, but re-ran ICE to correct that. ZSNES was a bit trick too install and not mess up the SteamOS-specific session, but I carefully installed all I could from the Alchemist repo without specifying the -t option until I had to install ZSNES (which obviously isn't in there).

Games launch fine from the desktop, but not within Steam. They launch ok, but seem to ignore all the settings I made on the desktop ZSNES program.

There is a plugin for xbmc called romcollectionbrowser which does something similar to Ice (in that it allows a frontend to launch games). romcollectionbrowser also allows people to add emulators and specify the commands with which it is launched. Instead of the 'command' setting that emulators have on Ice, romcollectionbrowser does 'Emulator Params', which is just everything following the emulator in the command. They also have an interesting syntax to specify different values to be substituted into the command.

You can find a list of the options available to here

https://code.google.com/p/romcollectionbrowser/wiki/EditRomCollectionLaunchGames

I'm not sure how many of those options will be useful to Ice (like there is no differentiation right now between the name of the game and the filename, though that could come later), but I think it would still be good to implement support for that style of command so all of the information currently out there about how to launch emulators from XBMC can be applied to Ice.

In practice, I imagine this will just be another setting (`emulator params`?) in emulators.txt

```
[ZSNES]
location=/Path/to/zsnes
emulator params=-m %rom%

I'm trying to get this going under Steam OS.

I have not had to even touch the config.txt file before thankfully but steam OS moved the install of steam to 
/home/steam/.local/share/Steam

On a 'normal' install of linux, it's located at
/home/.local/share/Steam.

I had thought I could edit the config.txt file with;
[Storage]# /home/steam/.local/share/Steam
or
[Storage]# ~/steam/.local/share/Steam

Another possible interpretation is putting it after '=>'  

These do not work. 

I've come up with parsing errors, the 'Roms directory' error. however I deleted everything other than the [Storage]# part since the rest seemed like it was example text.

The formatting of the config.txt file makes id almost impossible to tell where to edit something and what to edit, because there's no formatting. It's just one long line.
It seems so far like absolutely any edit to this file at all causes a 'Roms Directory' Error

When I am on windows I normally use [notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/) and that displays it correctly. You mention you are setting it up on SteamOS, have you tried any of the linux editors?

As for why this is happening, I believe Windows ends all of their lines with the characters '\r\n'. On Mac (where I do all of my development) and Linux, lines are normally ended with just '\n'. Notepad I think expects every line to be finished with '\r\n', which doesnt show up anywhere in config.txt, so it displays everything in one line.

I do plan on fixing that specific issue in the future though, as notepad is the default .txt editor on Windows and having config.txt display incorrectly on the default editor is not ok.

You can't get an emulator from the software manager because you can't add repositories.
You can download something like zsnes but for some reason linux programs never come in nice immediately usable packages, so you have to attempt to compile from the console - which will fail.

Steam OS splits everything between two accounts.  The primary UI is under the SteamOS account, which has steam in big picture mode and absolutely no desktop functionality. 

You can get into an administrative desktop but need to manually copy the roms across accounts so steam can launch them without an access error, let alone even see them and list the games.

This is very much a problem with how Steam OS is configured. ICE works fine on windows, and it works fine on a normal installation of linux.

It's probably entirely doable on Steam OS, but it's going to require a ridiculously complicated amount of work.  I've been at his for days. It's time to stop. 

Thank you both for your help. I look forward to hopefully seeing ICE work on Steam OS in the future. It probably technically does. It's just an epic nightmare to set up.

The issue is that, when I made ConsoleGrid, users couldnt add their own consoles to Ice. That meant I had a very short list of possible consoles to go by, and I was able to ensure that the nickname for the console was the same nickname that Ice used.

This changed when I added the ability to do custom emulators and custom consoles. This meant that Ice was sending a console nickname that ConsoleGrid had never heard of, and ConsoleGrid was sending back an error because of it. Ice also detects if ConsoleGrid is down by seeing if it returns 500 errors after a request. Ice saw the 500 error from sending it the Nintendo DS nickname and assumed ConsoleGrid was no longer operational, so it stopped making requests.

The fix to this is to either A) Make Ice just skip the console if it gets a 500 or B) Make ConsoleGrid handle nicknames it hasn't heard of more gracefully. I think I will probably do both.

I talked to the guys over at thegamesdb.net and they are planning on implementing steam grid images for the games on the site. When that happens, I plan on switching Ice over to using their data as opposed to ConsoleGrid (as they run a much better website than I do). Since ConsoleGrid has a limited lifetime, I am cautious of putting in too much work.

That being said, ConsoleGrid has been left behind by Ice. Its not just Wii, but since people can add consoles themselves, ConsoleGrid needs to step up. What I really need to do is add the ability to create consoles. I probably don't want to do that for any user though, as there aren't enough consoles to warrant giving everyone the ability to make new ones at will.

As in, if you add a game to Steam using Ice, then remove the ROM file, Ice will get rid of the Steam shortcut that it created for that game. It also has to keep in mind shortcuts that were made that don't use Ice, and avoid removing those. So the flow for Ice when syncing games is something like this
1. Get a list of all ROMs currently in the ROMs directory
2. Figure out which shortcuts were added by Ice
3. Remove any shortcuts that were added by Ice but no longer exist in the ROMs list

The problem you are having is at step 2. To determine whether a shortcut is made by Ice, and not just a random shortcut that the user added to Steam, Ice checks whether the shortcut refers to the ROMs directory. As you have shown, this is not exactly perfect, as the ROMs directory should be a safe place to put ROMs that aren't managed by Ice.

The fix for this is to make the logic to determine whether a shortcut is managed by Ice much more robust. Specifically, I will make it so that only the subfolders referenced by consoles count as 'managed by ice', not just the catchall ROMs folder.

By default, Steam uses the embedded .ico that is in the exe chosen when adding a non-steam game shortcut. This is why if BSNES is the default emulator, it already has the Super Nintendo Entertainment System logo for every SNES game because this logo is the icon within the BSNES.exe.

You can change the icons after adding a non-steam game shortcut. You are limited to selecting exe, tga, or png files when choosing a custom icon.

The path to the custom icon is shown in the shortcuts.vdf. I like the idea and think it would be a nice touch.

You will need to find another solution.

I have had a lot of problems with the 'open' command and Steam. I removed the code a couple commits ago, but when I had Snes9x going with the old Ice, I ended up having to autogenerate a script that called 'open -a' instead. Any time I tried using open -a with Steam it would either fail to load or it wouldnt load the ROM.

There are a surprising number of emulator-specific issues, like how Project64 (used to) not let you put your game name in quotes. I think I will make a github repo that just makes 'launcher programs' to standardize launching the emulators.

The reason I use the CRC code I do is that it lets me set a polynomial, reflectin and reflectout parameters. The most common use case for CRCs is ZIP files IIRC, and they use a certain polynomial. As such, most people that right CRC code just use the same polynomial that ZIP files do. Unfortunately for us, that is not the same polynomial that Steam uses.

As for giving you some test data to work with, check out the testFilenameForShortcut function of my SteamGrid test cases:

One side effect of using the --onefile option on pyinstaller (which I use to build the exe), is that it doesnt actually put it all in a single exe. It instead extracts the contents of the exe to a folder and then runs that. I imagine that a program putting itself in a random location and running the contents is suspicious for avast.

That being said, if you would like to set up your emulators to use the DPad as well, you should be able to configure them manually.

To do so, go to `C:\Users\<USERNAME>\AppData\Local\Scott Rice\Ice\Emulators`, and find the emulator you would like to configure.

Some of the emulators work better for double clicking than others. Specifically, I believe bsnes (the NES, SNES, and Gameboy emulator) will go into fullscreen as soon as you double click and it wont let you out.

To solve this, go to `settings.cfg`, and set `Video::StartFullScreen` to `false`

As for splitting up emulators and consoles, I want to keep them the way they are. There are two big reasons for this:
- You can reuse an emulator multiple times without copying all of the information again (example: Mednafen for NES, SNES, Gameboy, and Genesis).
- I can release an emulator 'starter pack'. This is my plan to fix how hard setting up Ice 2.0 is. 2.0 is great for people who already use emulators a bunch (and already have them configured exactly the way they want), but it is terrible for people who have never used an emulator before and just want to play Super Smash Bros in Steam. The 'starter pack' would download the most recent version of emulators, put them in a folder set by the user, and would generate an emulators.txt correctly configured with the downloaded emulators.

I really like the idea of letting people specify separate ROM folders for each console though. I will keep this issue open to track the progress of that feature.

The issue with this is that Ice will use the disc number in the search term when looking for images, and it won't find results. From the top of my head there are two ways around this:
- Add separate entries in consolegrid for each disc. This is the simplest to implement but a bit hard to maintain. Images would have to be uploaded multiple times and ratings would also be doubled.

It is actually very useful for our purpose of integrating the emulators into BPM.

Final Fantasy 7 Scenario:

Once you reach CD2, it will prompt you to save using CD1 still. After saving it asks to swap to CD2. This is not possible without a mouse, keyboard, etc since you have to specify CD2.

However, after saving, you can then instead just close the emulator and load up CD2 within BPM. After loading CD2, you can launch your save.

This allows full control within BPM using the controller.

Most games use this method. However, there are some that require a disc swap. In those cases, the user wouldn't have any other choice except to bind his controller to mouse and keyboard keys with a 3rd party program (Xpadder for example) in order to manually swap ISOs.

Edit: It may not be pretty to have a seperate Steam entry per CD, however I think in most cases, it adds ease of use.

The catch is how to make the app user friendly when it comes to configuring it. I mean, I think ICE's installer could recognise which file is CD1, CD2 etc using certain file naming conventions, kinda like it does when finding the grid covers.

- Parsing name out of filename (right now name=filename, and I search consolegrid for that. I would need to be able to identify that ""Final Fantasy VII (Disc 1)"" and ""Final Fantasy VII (2)"" are both ""Final Fantasy VII""
- Programatically changing the grid image. If consolegrid is going to give me the same grid image for discs 1 and 2 I need to be able to differentiate them in BPM, and putting an overlay on is the best way of doing that.
- Dealing with emulators. It sounds like it has been tested above, but multi disc game support is really tied to the emulators. If the emulators dont let me launch the second disc directly then I am kinda screwed in what I can do.

That's how I see it at least. The first two are actually big projects to get right, especially the parsing could be a huge pain. I will try to look into it in the near future.

I can't speak for all games, but at least with Final Fantasy games the emulator will boot from the second or third or fourth disc and then prompt the user to load a save file (that gets created when the player reaches the end of the previous disc).  I imagine this is how most of these games function on PSX/PS2/GC.  I think that was also the workflow with Resident Evil for GC.  Since in general, the player will constantly be opening the same disc until it is time to change, I don't see a real downside to only placing one disk at a time into the Steam grid.

Anyway - on your bullet points:
- My thought for multidisc games is that instead of having all discs at the root directory, all discs would be placed in folders, or better yet .zip archives.  This way we can be programmatically more inclusive of different naming conventions and not have side effects with games like Super Mario Bros, Super Mario Bros 2, etc.  Matter of fact, the disc naming convention may not even matter if the current disc is always user selected.  Multidisc doesn't always mean sequential, so a C&C GDI/NOD situation would also be handled gracefully this way.
- My above idea would probably lessen the pain of the issue with changing the grid image, although perhaps you'd still want to show the user which disc was currently active.
- Launching the second disc directly is definitely do-able - at least in ePSXe I've had no issues with games like MGS and FF.

Sounds like the GUI is really the most important thing you're working on currently - I'd love to help but I have no experience with GUI's in Python - but I'd love to donate to the project if you want to provide a link.

in case of bin files, they may belong to a single CD image rather  than to CD1, CD2 and CD3. in this case there should be a cue sheet file which is a text based file and should contain entries of multilayer disc. emulator is using cue sheet to mount Image. I believe the algorithm should be as following>>
1)scan the directory for files. and add them to the list(list is a root branch tree where root is directory.)
2)if cue sheet (of meta descriptor like for mdf files is .mds).
3)scan for entries of multilayer disc. remove the occurrences of the layers from the list and insert below the cue sheet. 
4)identify the game by 
       virtually mounting image 
         scanning file system for presence of  SLES or SLUS(for play station CD identification. others may differ and require md5 checkup)
5)based on information from step 4 retrieve game information from database.

My question is this: If we are doing based on the extension, does it make more sense to apply the file extensions to the Consoles, not the emulators? The reason I say this is that there will be a lot of overlap (all SNES emulators will need to accept 'sfc', for example), and adding a whitelist extension for a multi-platform emulator seems like a SUPER long list (for example bsnes, which does nes, snes, gameboy, gameboy advance, etc).

It does imply that all emulators of a certain console accept the same file types (which isn't always the case - for example, snes9x takes .smc and .sfc, while some versions of bsnes only accept .sfc). However, most people will use one emulator for all games of a certain console so they can just change their config accordingly. So keeping the extensions on console level does seem like the most 'clean' solution

I'll change it accordingly :)

The 'command' option is the command used to open the program and run the ROM. It is easily the hardest part of getting an emulator set up. Most emulators use '%l %r', though not all of them. For example, Dolphin uses ""%l /b /e %r"" (or ""%l --batch --exec=%r"" on Mac/Linux). To find these values, you need to figure out how to launch a ROM in the emulator from the command line.

That being said, it should be functional if you follow these steps

Go to emulators.txt, and add a 3 lines as follows

```
[NAME]
location=PATH
command=COMMAND
```

`NAME` should be the name of the emulator. You will use this in consoles.txt to associate an emulator with the games for a console (will get to that in a bit)

`PATH` should be the location of the emulator on your computer. Make sure to point this to the actual .exe file.

`COMMAND` is the 'format' of the command Steam uses to launch the game. You can use '%r' for the location of the ROM, and '%l' for the location of the emulator. The most common value for this (and the one you should try first if you arent sure) is `%l %r`.

When you have the emulator set up, you next go to consoles.txt. Find the console you want, and set 'emulator' to be the name of the emulator in emulators.txt.

With everything set up, your files should look like this

###### emulators.txt

```
[Nestopia]
location=C:\Emulators\Nestopia\nestopia.exe
command=%l %r

###### consoles.txt

The `rom_manager` wants to create the directory ""roms_dir"".

```
roms_dir = filesystem_helper.roms_directory()
if not os.path.exists(roms_dir):
    log_both(""Creating ROMs directory at %s"" % roms_dir)
    os.makedirs(roms_dir)
```

But roms_dir is defined as  `filesystem_helper.roms_directory()`:

```
def roms_directory():
    """"""
    Returns the path to the ROMs directory, as specified by config.txt.
    """"""
    path = os.path.expanduser(settings.config()['Storage']['roms directory'])
    if not os.access(path, os.W_OK):
        path = os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'),'ROMs')
    return path
```

This always defaults to ~/ROMs, because the directory that should be created, isn't created yet.

A fix could be to create the directory in the function `roms_directory`:

```
def roms_directory():
    """"""
    Returns the path to the ROMs directory, as specified by config.txt. If the path is empty, default to ""~/ROMs""
    """"""
    path = os.path.expanduser(settings.config()['Storage']['roms directory'])
    if not os.access(path, os.W_OK):
            if path == """":
                path = os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'),'ROMs')
            else:
               create_directory_if_needed(path)
    return path
```

Then of course this code in `rom_manager` would have to be changed as well:

```
roms_dir = filesystem_helper.roms_directory()
if not os.path.exists(roms_dir):
    log_both(""Creating ROMs directory at %s"" % roms_dir)
    os.makedirs(roms_dir)

The sometext~1 is only used in the temp directories, whereas the problem is coming from the result of appdirs (which provides the C:\Users*username*\AppData\Local\Scott Rice\Ice\ path).

The other option for fixing this is to just remove the use of appdirs. I know someone on Reddit wanted an option to choose where Ice downloads its emulators and such.

The only thing I worry about is the old 'exe' method. When I first started Ice, I had all of the steam shortcuts point to a shell script, and then the shell script would take care of launching the game/rom (there was a shell script for each game). As I learned more about Steam, I stopped doing that, but the Mac emulators (which I did first) still have that functionality. The reason I worry about it is because the shell scripts that I used were stored in the same directory as the Emulators/Downloaded Zips. That means that Steam would be linking to a path that can change via config.txt.

If I rip that out (which I really should have done a while ago), then I dont think there will be any problems with removing appdirs.

Ice will add the destination with the normalized ROM name, so that it will be an invalid destination.

Two ways I can think of to work around this problem:
- Rename the ROM to a normalized name (`Super Mªn -> Super Man`) or
- Figure out how to add non-ASCII symbols to `shortcuts.vdf`.

Personally I would rather not want to mess around with renaming files.

I had done the suggestion you gave scottrice, however it didnt resolve my issue. 

I believe someone earlier submitted a issue that touched upon what might be the real issue. bsnes doesnt handle .smc rom filetypes. And I am going to speculate that this is perhaps truegamebender's issue as what he is describing is what happens to me as well. This is really unfortunate as many people have their rom back-ups in this format. Ice is an otherwise marvelous project but this bsnes snafu is problematic for those who desire to use Ice to handle their SNES/Steam fix. I hope that more time is given to changing the default emulator for SNES because bsnes seems to be have been a problematic choice (performance issues included). Until bsnes is switched out for a new emulator I have mountain of snes roms that sit unplayed in steam because of bsnes' inability to play a very popular rom format. Perhaps other emulators might make a more friendlier choice?

First, the slightly more automatic way. Make sure your games exist on http://consolegrid.com/ and if they do, see if they have an image. If they do not, you can upload one and the next time you run ICE it will download the image and apply it automatically, the file names does need to match up with the games name on the site. 

Second, the manual way. It is the same as setting a image to any non steam game, Right click on the game in steam and pick add custom image and then select the image you want.

Some sites to find grid images when consolegrid.com doesn't have an image..

The code that removes this requirement is in the source, but apparently got left out of the executable.

As for why this happens, it is because of how Steam stores their shortcuts. When you close Steam, any shortcuts that you have are written to a file called 'shortcuts.vdf'. This is the file that Ice reads (and writes) to modify your shortcuts. It used to be that if this file didnt exist, Ice would just say ""No shortcuts file, skipping"". This ended up screwing over a lot of people though, as they wanted Ice to MAKE a shortcuts file. I removed this requirement in one of the more recent commits (like a day ago IIRC), but when I made the executable I apparently didnt get that new bit of code in. Hence all of the problems.

What are the contents of the .sfc folders?

Also, as for ConsoleGrid, I think its not getting images because of the (U) etc at the end of the filename. Not sure though. Try going to consolegrid.com and typing the name of the game into the search bar. See if you find anything.

Also bsnes isn't just looking for .sfc file extensions. The roms also cannot have headers. Sadly a lot of roms do (especially due to the rom translation scene).

The instructions are definitely not great. I realize that answering your questions here does little to solve the actual issue of bad documentation, but I can at least clear up what you mention.

1) Ice creates a 'ROMs' directory (by default in your home directory), which it also populates with subfolders. Each subfolder represents one console. For most consoles that is fine, but you do bring up a good point that Gameboy Color etc is not clear. The answer is to put it in the Gameboy folder, but that isn't always clear.

2) You have to put the ROMs in the folder yourselves.

3) Things have been breaking down pretty rapidly because my dropbox links were shut down. I will put the downloads in a new location and update the issue. If things are still not working for you, I will troubleshoot with you.

4) The point is that adding those ROMs to Steam is a pain in the ass. Steam assumes that there is only one 'shortcut' (what they call a non-Steam game) for each executable. That means to get a single emulator set up with a ton of different ROMs is super time consuming. Plus, this breaks down the work needed to ""find ROM and put it in right directory"", not ""find ROM, figure out command needed to launch ROM using emulator, create batch file with that command, add batch file to Steam, go online and find image for game, add image to game"".

1) I understand how it works, just that the lack of documentation here is not so great.  I noticed you are thinking of adding a GUI and that would help alleviate this problem, if users could simply drag-and-drop their ROMs onto a console entry of choice and have them sorted properly.

2) Understood.

3) Yeah, realize now the issue is mostly related to the Dropbox links and the program itself _should_ work okay otherwise.  :)

4) Oh, I understand the point of Ice to begin with, don't get me wrong, I'm just saying that your readme/config did not make it clear what specifying a ROMs folder was even doing.

""[Storage]
The path to place your ROMs Directory. This can be in any drive or anywhere,
as long as the full path is specified. Use ~ to represent your home folder
(for example, C:\Users\Scott)

Ice will place a folder called ROMs at the specified location.""

That implies the point of this step is to create a ROMs directory, instead of specifying a directory to search to begin with.  This ties back in to point 2) - you need to more clearly instruct the user on what the steps in the process do and what naming format, sorting, etc. is needed to get things working.  If the user can't even figure out how you need the ROMs to be organized to be added to Steam properly, then that's an issue.

It's currently only possible to start Ice using the GUI (click the 'Run Ice' button on the main window), but in the future it can be made possible to change settings through the GUI (see the 'Settings' tab). This will make it a lot easier for people to add custom emulator binaries rather than using the default ones, see https://github.com/scottrice/Ice/issues/71.

You'll also note that the GUI log isn't being updated real-time right now. This is because we need to look into threading - shouldn't be much of a problem though. Here's a reference: http://manojbits.wordpress.com/2013/01/24/threading-in-pyqt4/

A GUI for Ice right now should be pretty simple. I think a settings tab is a great idea. Personally, since Ice post #72 will have a much harder setup than pre #72, I think we should have a small program that just walks the user through getting everything set up. It will help them add emulators they want to use, add consoles they want to use, tell them if they are missing an important part of information, etc.

What do you think?

Ice is currently really bloated when considering it's main objective is to automatically add launchers for emulator games.
We probably shouldn't worry about adding a GUI until Ice (version 2 if I may) is up and running. That way we won't mess around with too much at the same time.

Using already installed emulators is without a doubt the best choice for all platforms (Windows, Mac and GNU/Linux) as it will make sure that all dependencies (at least on Mac and GNU/Linux) are met when installing the emulators.

When that is done, a GUI to guide users through recommended emulators and where/how to install them should be easy. It should also be really easy make a 'Settings' GUI for all console emulators, where users can open file browsers to link Ice to their emulator of choice etc.

I can hardly see how Ice would gain much from it anyway - it's not like someone would be adding new ROMs and emulators multiple times a day. Choosing to make Ice constantly run in the background, checking for new changes in the `~/ROMs` directory just seem like a waste to me.

I will totally be doing this, and I plan on automating as much of it as possible as I can. I think it should be comparable to a Sickbeard/CouchPotato setup with a media server like plex on the other end.

Additionally, I'd say that from reading the README, this is probably what @scottrice intends/intended, but isn't currently possible. Hopefully valve adds some kind of API for it.

That being said, I would like to make a 'Sickbeard for games'. The problem I have with it right now is lack of availability for the files I need on Usenet (and I really dont want to deal with Torrents/Direct Download sites). What I will probably end up making is a web interface to managing your ROMs. So you go to site, navigate to the 'Nintendo 64' page, upload a file for 'Super Smash Bros', and then it shows up in Steam. This will be a completely separate project to Ice though.

You could call os.system(pip install psutil) but that requires root/admin rights and it's in poor taste to automatically install python modules for people.

You could also just add the entire lib/site-packages/ folder to the git and then call the folder like you would a package.  If you used this method, you would need to follow the New BSD license for it (Just add copyright to the code being used http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause )

Then there is writing your own method like you said, which is fun but when dealing with OS dependant stuff can be very time consuming.

This, however, works just fine using PyInstaller, so if you want the binaries to check if Steam is running, this solution should work just fine.

Gruntfile.js
app/scripts/libs/Handlebars.js

update:    package.json     **(without  ""grunt-contrib-livereload"": ""1.0.1"")**

Only his JS files and some images are in the S3 bucket, rest of his site isn't (as far as I know, but I'll double check with him).

So what he's done for now is just kill those js files entirely -- they were only for fontawesome stuff.  So he's using the fontawesome CDN now.

It's great seeing you back to the project!

I was learning while trying to enhance many aspects of Strut, my code is a mess, I admit it, but the end user-facing results may looks good. It's my first-and-only backbone/requirejs/,,, project, but I tried as much as I can to follow your structure.

You can check it out here:
https://github.com/MohannadNaj/Strut

and the dist version at `gh-pages`:
https://mohannadnaj.github.io/Strut/

Mainly the newly added features:

- Migrated to Bootstrap 3 (only this part is included in this PR https://github.com/tantaman/Strut/pull/375 although I remember it's not completed and I had to modify some files here and there after the latest commit on that PR).

- Ability to paste images directly from the keyboard in the ""Image"" modal!

- Ability to move components using the keyboard (with/without Shift for larger movement, right /left /up /down)

- Adding substeps support!

With a z-index to increase/decrease, a feature for better arrangement of components inside the slide and showing one substep before the other. This controls in the upper left corner:

![Screenshot of substeps controls](https://i.imgur.com/FHwsg5n.png)

- Adding and using ""Settings"" control button
![Screenshot of settings](https://i.imgur.com/cqjjUOL.png)

As a control modal for some user settings

using this modal, the options for now:
[ ] Upload Images to Imgur.com `(ability to use base64 instead)`
[ ] Show usage hint at presentation beginning `(the first hint in the generated presentation)`
[ ] Hide other slides while navigating `(before this, excluding the active slide all slides in impress had a opacity high degree, this setting will hide it completely)`.

[ ] Hide substeps only before the first time they enter the slide, then keep it shown `(prevents hiding the newly showed substeps after stepping out of a slide)`

----

I'm not confident enough to submit all of these changes as a PR. it's alot of changes.

If there is some specific features up there you want me to extract and submit alone, I'm happy to do it. otherwise, there is a possibility that my ideas may inspire you. and I'm really excited seeing you back here, I do believe in your project/philosophy!

One very (very) quick way to do that would be to use Python's built-in webserver:

```
cd dir_containing_image_file
python -m SimpleHTTPServer

Then set the embed's src to `http://localhost:8000/video_filename.avi`.  That should work!

No web-based presentation framework will be able to load arbitrary files from your hard drive, as that would be unconscionably insecure.  If you want a video or any type of file to be available on the web, a web server is necessary.

One possible solution is to embed the video in your presentation, using a Data URI.  As a warning, the base64 string generated will be HUGE, possibly larger than your clipboard allows.  But if you want to try that, here goes:
1. go to [drop64.com](http://drop64.com/)
2. drag and drop your video file into the black box
3. wait as the base64 string is generated (it could take a while if your video file is large)
4. copy and paste the base64 string into the src attribute of your embed element, ie `src=""data:video/avi;base64,...""`

In all likelihood, your video will generate a string so big that this isn't going to work.  I only mention it because I've used the same process for embedding other, smaller filetypes into strut presentations.

I think that strut in its actual version can not do that, you can import / export your presentation in json format though. I've tried to create a version with server side implementation using PHP, you can check and try it now on [my website](http://pascal-mietlicki.fr/strut) but be aware that it's still in early development, so you could experience some bugs.

The process is simple : create a presentation by entering its name and description (you have to be registered and connected to do that), then click on ""Edit"". The Edit link is the official write link so avoid to share it (if not try to work on it one at a time because I have not implemented concurrent writing).

The read links to share it are different between generators : so you can generate and share the impress one, bespoke one or handouts one. Just use the different buttons that appears next to your presentation.

Hope it can help.

Concurrent writing could be difficult to implement. But I plan to treat it by checking the last update of the presentation and, automatically, update all the presentation opened at the same time in writing mode. So yes I'm thinking about it because I've already done it on an other project. But I'll need to test it thoroughly.
A local installation is already possible. As soon as it's stable and if people are interested, I'll share the plugin.
I'm looking forward for your remarks.

I'll try to answer your questions.  I have to guess at what you mean by ""HTML Presentation component"".  I don't understand your exact use case, but I hope this is helpful nonetheless!

> Integrate Strut in my website

To host Strut, all you need is a basic webserver (apache, nginx, etc).  Follow the [build instructions](https://github.com/tantaman/Strut#developmentbuilding) and copy the `dist/` directory into a web-accessible directory.

> Math Equation Support
> Comparing to MathJax, I prefer LaTeX. Somewhat like #151

I've had really good luck with [KaTeX](https://khan.github.io/KaTeX/).  It's much faster than MathJax.  All of them should be usable inside Strut.  :)

> Code syntax coloring and indenting
> Maybe integrad codemirror

This is possible.  People forget that Markdown is a superset of HTML.  All you need to do is paste the codemirror component code into a Markdown slide.

> Self-define html&css&js DIV box Support
> Somewhat like issue #3 , but not for the whole slide, only for one area.

I'm not sure what you mean by ""self-define"", but I suggest using HTML and CSS (this is the web, after all!) to arrange things in your slides.  Anything you can do with HTML/CSS/JS, you can do inside a Strut slide, so Strut has far more capabilities than people tend to assume.

To answer your easiest question, there is no back-end code in Strut.  It's a pure front-end/client/browser (whatever you want to call it) app.  So yes, hosting Strut on your site is as simple as copying the HTML+JS+CSS+images onto your site.

I like your ideas for the Code, Math, etc buttons.  It would require quite a bit of work to add those features, though.  Personally, I prefer to just use the Markdown slides, where I can add anything I want.  Code, Math, HTML, etc, can _all_ be used now, by inserting them into Markdown slides.  It isn't _quite_ as simple as clicking a button, but it is possible, and much more flexible.  My flexible, I mean that you can use whatever syntax highlighting library you want, whatever TeX library you want, instead of having to rely on the one that Strut would pick.

Lastly, I don't know if or how Strut uses reveal.js, but I see a lot of references to it in the source code (sorry, I am not the Strut author!).

To recap: if I remain in the editing window, I get the math working when I reload the page (which might be ok, I guess) but when I use the green impress button to preview it in the browser, math is not working (as it is not working when I save the show as a web complete page using the browser). So I guess the preview is in fact a correct preview of what I get when I download the presentation. This being the case, it seems to me that the problem is the way the mathjax file is linked: while I am in the editor it is directly fetched from the remote website (and probably sees supporting files correctly) when I preview it assumes the files locally, but the mathjax.js is only part of what should be there and it is not working. So without requesting any change on the 'official' strut, is there any strut file (in the source) where I can force the insertion of the two scripts without using the markdown so that I can use my locally built strut to preview and eventually postprocess the result to cope with a possibly local mathjax installation?

with several different shapes, import the presentation below and run it

I poked at it briefly and it looks like `scale.width` and `scale.height`
are not being applied to the `svg` elements in the overview or in the
final presentation.

Here's the SVG element for the pentagon in the presentation below, in
the slide editor:

```
<svg height=""587.0000466237644"" width=""41.08071395442089"" version=""1.1"" xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"" viewBox=""0 0 726 726"" preserveAspectRatio=""none"">

</svg>
```

And here it is in the final presentation:

```
<svg version=""1.1"" xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"" viewBox=""0 0 726 726"" preserveAspectRatio=""none"">
    <polygon points=""723,314 543,625.769145 183,625.769145 3,314 183,2.230855 543,2.230855 723,314""></polygon>

Everything looks correct except for the missing width and height
attributes.  I'll try to make some time to fix this unless someone else
wants to tackle it.

Mounting WebDAV locally doesn't really solve the use case I am thinking of: i.e. write presentation on home computer using strut; then go to conference and be forced to use their windows computer (think obscure projector connections).  I did this the other day by mounting WebDAV separately but I would not say that would be easy for non technically skilled users and it took quite a bit longer to get going (esp. because windows does not have a functional built in WebDAV client).  Having strut treat WebDAV as a storage option internally would be very useful for people that need to continue a presentation on a different computer in this manner.
Also, WebDAV should be the first protocol supported as most other providers (dropbox, owncloud etc. offer WebDAV as an access protocol, as they should it being the standard).

- Impress generates Impress.js code. That lets you position slides on a giant whiteboard thingy and make cool transitions.
- Bespoke is kind of like Impress, but it has a list of pre-defined transitions.
- Handouts generates a static webpage: no effects, everything on one page. It's probably useful to someone giving a Strut presentation that wants an overview for personal use.

Concatenating source files to improve load time, minifying them to improve load time and execution speed, writing code in an alternate language and transpiling it into JavaScript, etc etc.

If all you need is a deployment, I deployed Strut on OpenShift a couple months ago.  It's available [here](http://strut-mwcz.rhcloud.com/).  It's a newer version of Strut than the one at strut.io/editor, and mine includes the localStorage image upload.  I intend to leave it up forever so feel free to use it.

If you really do need to deploy this yourself, it should be doable.  Installing Grunt and npm on windows is possible I'm sure, but I wouldn't know how, exactly.  You need to install Node first so that you can run `npm`, and once you have npm you can `npm install -g grunt` to get grunt.  Maybe [this](http://www.hacksparrow.com/install-node-js-and-npm-on-windows.html) page helps?

Here is a draft from my research about open source licenses:

Top 10 Reasons Why An MIT license is Much Better Than a GPL license

 I do think that an MIT License would be much better for a program/software where a major user base of the software consists of enterprises, organizations, corporations, companies or even institutions etc. There are a lot of reasons for a company or organization to use a software under the MIT license instead of adopting a similar software with the GPL license. Below, I am listing some of the major points, which, according to me, end up being the deal breaker for a lot of would-be-customers; thus potentially hampering the overall growth potential of the core open source project/software/program as a whole.

Note: 
All these points have been thoroughly researched by me in the last few months and thus have the credibility of being unusually accurate and factual, and therefore, consists of only a few (or rather minimal) personal opinionated viewpoints. Also, I have written the whole stuff as simply as I could, so that even a layman (or rather a normal person) could understand everything, and help make an informed decision.

1.
A very basic reason for businesses to avoid the use of open source softwares/programs is the un-necessary hassle of going through a lengthy license/terms& conditions document which is included with the software/codebase. These needs, often result in hiring special law firms to simplify the terms of the license while also examining any kind of loopholes which might make a dent in the execution of their project, in the future. Normally, a single usual license document spans in the range of approximately, at least 1000 words, full with industry jargons, which is extremely difficult for a normal person (who is not a lawyer) to comprehend. And, GPL is considered as one of the lengthiest and most complicated licenses in the world of open source.

2.
In contrast to the complicated and lengthy GPL copyleft license , the MIT license is considered to be one of the easiest and shortest licensing systems in the world, which only spans only onto a quarter of an A4 paper sheet. This simplicity makes MIT licensing much more easier for a normal person to comprehend and understand, without hiring a special lawyer or even wasting a lot of time in trying to figure out the meaning & implications of using a software, due to an overly lengthy & complex licensing system that is The GPL.

3.
Enterprises, Entrepreneurs, and small/large businesses, including almost everyone else who could possibly be the end user of the concerned software project; need to be able to deploy the software to a wide range of platforms and operating systems. Covering a wide range of platforms, specially the biggest ones, makes it easier for the company or organization to make the most out of their software, simply by making it accessible to a wide range of people, irrespective of whatever platform they might use to access the software. Recently the rise of B.Y.O.D (Bring Your Own Device) in enterprises / organizations have made it essential for companies to make their primary softwares/programs accessible to all major platforms in the global market. Some of the most popular platforms include Apple’s iOS (iPad, iPod, iPhone), Apple’s Macintosh, Microsoft’s Windows 8, and Google’s Android. Now, the problem comes here: GPL licenses have been completely banned by both Apple and Microsoft as regards their mobile platforms. Apple has strictly stated in their terms & conditions licensing agreement that, a GPL license (Including all other copyleft licenses ) is in-compatible with iOS’s terms & conditions , and thus this has resulted in the rejection of many world class famous softwares/apps, from Apple’s App Store; two of them being —VLC Media Player, —Mozilla Firefox. The same is true with the latest version of Windows 8.1 (For the windows App Store). An article on LifeHacker.com said it best after the VLC media player was pulled off the iOS app Store, by Apple:

""We were pretty excited when multi-format video player VLC dropped for iOS, but it looks like the sun has already set on that glorious endeavor. Just as we'd heard it might, VLC has been removed from the App Store. It was decided that the the DRM in the App Store violated the GNU public license, thus resulting in the removal of the app from the App Store. We're not sure we buy this interpretation of the GPL, and it doesn't quite make sense that it takes what was a completely free and easily available app away from millions of users. Worse, it doesn't set the best precedent for other open source projects, especially with the Mac App Store having similar DRM features. We hope you all grabbed your copy while you had a chance. ""
---- Source: LifeHacker.com (*1)

Thus, the exclusion of 3 of the world’s biggest mobile platforms as well as Apple's desktop based Mac OS-App Store for all the GPL based softwares makes the software product extremely limited as regards its deployment options, which is more than enough for a lot of companies/organizations to simply ignore/cut-off the GPL based software based solutions from their list of possible solutions. Now, who doesn’t want an equivalent app of a software for their iPhones & iPad’s, specially in the world of the post-pc era, which is ruled by the revolutionary mobile technologies viz. Smartphones & Tablets. The resultant of these issues have been a big blow for the communities/organizations/companies behind VLC media player as well as Mozilla community.
These licensing inconsistencies have resulted in the loss of hundreds of millions of potential users who would have been using these products/apps, had it been available for their platforms/mobile devices. Instead of making the software more accessible, the GPL has instead gone the wrong way, and in the end, no one is benefited in return of such restrictions. The potential users, the GPL based softwares, developers, platforms, etc all of them have turned out to be the big losers , the biggest losers being the software developers who had chosen GPL licensing, which resulted in a loss of hundreds of millions of potential users; which in most cases do turn out to make a difference big enough to pose a life & death crisis. And, too often than not-- that makes all the difference.

4.
In contrast to GPL, the other licenses like the MIT license & BSD license, are perfectly compatible with both of the platforms, i.e.; Apple’s iOS as well as Microsoft’s Windows 8.1 Mobile platform (I explicitly mean their respective App Stores.) Again, there are many apps/softwares available in the online app stores which have been following the MIT/BSD licensing policies and have never had any problem with almost any platforms, let alone the biggest ones in the industry . Thus, it turns out that, those developers who need/want to go the open source way, without restricting their software’s reach to some of the biggest platforms that the world has to offer, they only have a couple of options viz. BSD & MIT, and sadly, GPL licensing (Any of the various versions including the GPL 2.0, GPL 3.0) is not one of them. Choosing a GPL licensing in today’s world, could very well prove to be a death blow to these developers and their softwares. Again, the only reason that there still are many of the open source communities who are still with the GPL, is the fact that they had decided to go with it almost a decade back, and they had no idea then, as to the future implications of it. Now, for them, it’s already too late, and to apply some other license or rather to change the license of a community based software like the Wordpress (which contains millions of lines of codes, contributed by thousands or even millions of developers ) , is in itself a challenge that might take years to implement; as they would actually need to contact each and every developer (Probably in millions)of the wordpress code base, and get them to agree to the new licensing terms; which obviously sounds unrealistic and pretty much impossible, at least for the next few years. As far as we talk about the freedom principles regarding the open source technologies, The licenses like MIT & BSD are actually even more open and inclined towards the freedom of its end users as well as it’s developer community or Organizations. Essentially, BSD & MIT are but a superset of the open source licenses; the subsets being the GPL, AGPL, LGPL etc. Again, MIT & BSD licenses are not only compatible with the regulations/terms&conditions of Microsoft & Apple, but interestingly both of them are also compatible with the various number of GPL licenses. Quoting Wikipedia:

""Many of the most common free software licenses, such as the original MIT/X license, BSD licenses (in the three-clause and two-clause forms, though not the original four-clause form), MPL 2.0, and LGPL, are ""GPL-compatible"". That is, their code can be combined with a program under the GPL without conflict (the new combination would have the GPL applied to the whole).""
---- Source: wikipedia.org (*2)

Thus, at any time in the future, a customer of the open source software could convert the license to a GPL license and then go on to continue whatever he wants to do with the software, while also following the guidelines of the GPL license.

5.
Another drawback of the GPL license is it’s incompatibility within it’s own versions of GPL licenses. Quoting Wikipedia:

""When it comes to copyleft software licenses, they are not inherently GPL-compatible, even the GPLv2 is, by itself, not compatible with GPLv3.""
---- Source: wikipedia.org (*3)

The above quoted text from wikipedia, makes it pretty simple to conclude that, The GPL license is a bit too complex as well as restrictive , so as to make it’s own consecutive versions, incompatible with each other. This also clearly depicts the in-flexibility as well as inconsistency which, many-a-times defeats the overall purpose of an open sourced world , where the Freedom of end users to utilize the software gets highly limited (as regards commercial usage) .

6.
The latest version of GPL, denoted as GPL 3.0 is considerably even more complex and restrictive when compared to its own previous version of the license, called the GPL 2.0. This proves the arrogance of the GPL community to intentionally make the license more & more inflexible as well as restrictive. Sadly, it is because of this arrogance that, the future of GPL as regards compatibility with a number of World's biggest software platforms remains moot, at best. Going with this attitude, it is likely, that in the near future, the GPL based softwares will become alienated from an even more number of future platforms & Operating Systems (due to incompatibility & irrational demands of GPL licensing Clauses) , thus resulting into a huge loss of hundreds of millions of users. 
Quoting an excellent paragraph from an article at tuaw.com :

""Can the App Store and the GPL co-exist?
The most obvious conflict between the App Store and the GPL is the third freedom – the freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor.There has been lengthy discussion about this issue, with people advancing arguments on both sides. Sadly, the bottom line is this: firstly, it's a gray area, and secondly, it's unlikely to ever be certain one way or the other without a legal trial. We're unlikely to ever get a trial because Apple (as software distributor for all App Store programs) is probably not going to ever go to bat for an Open Source package in a courtroom. So the practical outcome is that the App Store and the GPL are incompatible until proven otherwise, and it's probably never going to be proven otherwise. Apple certainly thinks so, or it wouldn't have removed VLC (and other Open Source apps like GNU Go) from the App Store.""

7.
Another option is the concept of a dual licensing system, in which the same software is offered to the users in two separate licensing systems, where, the end user is completely free to download and use the software in terms of any of the available licensing that is provided by the developers of the software concerned. Thus, the option to keep the software under dual license viz. 1. GPL & 2. MIT is a pretty reliable solution for those people who do not want to give up on the GPL license. Then again: why keeping the GPL at all, if one always needed the other license to do something with the code, anyways? Add to it the complexity of the GPL itself; a dual licensing turns out to be an inelegant compromise to solve the inherent flaws/inconsistency of the GPL. So, in any case, a MIT/BSD license is all that's actually needed to make an open source project 'Truly Open' without un-necessary restrictions, thus enabling the project to be a lot more accessible to the millions of potential users as well as organizations around the globe.

8.
One of the amazing outcome of using a truly open licensing ( like MIT, BSD) is explained in another article from tuaw.com. To Quote the paragraph:-

""Open Source has brought us many high-quality software products: the gcc C compiler, the Mach kernel, the Apache HTTPd web server, the bash command shell, the Perl and Python programming languages and the WebKit rendering engine used in Safari. These and hundreds more are all Open Source, and they are all shipped as part of Mac OS X. Clearly, Apple believes in Open Source.""
Source: tuaw.com (*5)

The above could only be possible with a licensing like the MIT or BSD. A GPL based license could never have resulted in these wonderful products described in the quote above.

9.
The simplified BSD license is another version of BSD license which is almost similar to MIT License and grants the users as well as developers, the maximum rights and freedom. These licenses are also approved by the various licensing regulating bodies viz.
FSF approved (Free Software Foundation)
OSI approved (Open Source License)
DFSG compatible ( The Debian Free Software Guidelines)
GPL Compatible

10.
Truth be told, the GPL essentially comes under the Free Software Foundation which 
focuses on the user's freedom to use the program, to modify it, and to share it. 
While True Open Source Software focuses on the availability of the source code and the ability to modify and share it. While on one hand, GPL is a Free Software License, 
On the other hand The MIT & Simplified BSD are true Open Source licenses. 
--Source Wikipedia (*6)

Thus, a truly open source software should ideally be following the MIT or BSD licensing Systems rather than Free Software Licenses like GPL.

Conclusion:

The next generation Open Source enthusiasts & developers should fully embrace & support the more open licenses which have lesser restrictions & more freedom ( MIT/ Simplified BSD etc. ) , thus benefiting everyone in the long term. The outcome is a win-win situation, where everyone wins! ( The points below make it a bit more clear)

(A) The developers benefit by getting access to almost all the major platforms for releasing such softwares ( under MIT/ Simplified BSD), thus reaching millions of would be users.

(B) The users benefit by being able to use the open source softwares on any of his or her favorite platforms.

(C) The various organizations, enterprises & companies get the benefit of utilizing such open source softwares without worrying about giving up all of their own proprietary software codes (just because they used a small open source plugin with a copyleft license like the GPL) ; while simultaneously also enabling the original software owner to keep their copyright intact.

I think the license choice is excellent. You want to be like Etherpad and have someone fork and make something like Hackpad where most people (non-coders) aren't even aware there was an open-source option?

AGPL is a superb license, and everyone should be using it. It protects the freedoms of the people who use the software, not just the freedoms of developers.

**Thank you for using the AGPL!**

That said, I recognize that there's value in getting more contributions from companies who don't like the freedom the AGPL guarantees… So I can understand some argument for choosing more permissive licenses. But then, there's also people who care about software freedom who will be much happier to contribute _because_ it is AGPL…

To address the concerns above:

\1 & 2. License length is a terrible way to judge something. Standards are what matters here. Hundreds of long licenses are crazy. I only need to read the AGPL once, and part of the length is the inspiring call to care about software freedom.

\3 & 4 & 6. Yes, Apple and others having terms that actively sabotage free software licenses is a big problem. And yes, we pick our battles, but Apple and others are at fault here. What they are doing is an active attack on the community, and suggesting we play by their rules is only going to make things worse.

\5. Yes, compatibility is the single biggest flaw of copyleft licenses. It's a legitimate concern. In this case, it doesn't matter much though. The solution, of course, is for everyone to stick to the same copyleft licenses, like everyone should just use the AGPLv3+. (Oh, please include the + ""or later"" part, that helps with compatibility concerns).

also about 6: that has a bunch of hyperbole about arrogance and bullshit. The GPLv3 and AGPLv3 are absolutely legally sound licenses. This is nothing more than FUD.

\7. Yes, dual licensing exists, yes it is problematic. Simpler to just stick with AGPL.

\8. ""Clearly, Apple believes in Open Source."" But clearly not in software freedom. Apple actually believes in just-enough-Open-Source that they benefit while giving back as little as possible and controlling things as much as possible.

\9. 10. The GPL and AGPL are completely accepted as Open Source licenses. Yes, they do a better job at protecting user freedom than permissive licenses. Obviously people objecting are programmers who care only about code and not about ethics. It also happens from a business-perspective that copyleft prevents a serious business problem: other companies stealing your customers and then using proprietary restrictions to lock them in so you can't get them back. Only with a license like AGPL can you be sure that if any competitors arise using the same code, you can keep up with them and make it feasible for customers to go back and forth because lock-in is prohibited. Because permissive licenses lead to proprietary end-products, it actually often fragments the market but in a really static way that hurts all the businesses in the long-term.

---

Anyway, I was otherwise coming on here to post a request that Strut indicate the AGPL license on the homepage so everyone can see it and link to the code, and that you ought to include the complete license with the repo rather than just the brief summary with the link.

Thanks for respecting my freedom and for making this great software!

Dual-licensing isn't crazy, it's just problematic. And yes, the AGPL is not anti-commerce, so people can still do commercial things regardless.

Again, the entire issue boils down to: Apple and Google etc. have their interests which means they only like software they can fork and turn into proprietary controlled stuff. There's a call to please allow that because that might get those companies to support you. I'm saying ""screw them"" those companies are being malicious here. But then, they have a lot of power. Sometimes compromising makes sense, even when making a deal with the devil. But I'm not sure it's good in this case to compromise.

basically, I am not talking about developers or software guys. I am talking about the normal sane consumer, someone who doesn't want to code, but only wants to get his most basic things done. People who want a system that 'just works' & nothing beyond this. This comprises of 95% of the overall consumer market. So, GNU, GTK+ or even the beautiful Gnome, do not come close. However, You missed an awesome example called 'Android' which is Open Source but, yet again is licensed under Apache 2.0 & not GPL/AGPL , which means it is 100% commerce friendly. That's one reason it took over the world in 5 years, which linux as a desktop OS could not do in more than a couple of decades. 
And boss, I too love Open Source but I have a great respect for proprietary softwares too ( like Macintosh). You know, had there not been Free BSD OS ( under BSD License) , there wouldn't have been any macintosh! That's so much of a thing to be proud of as an admirer of Open Source. However, there are licenses which although take pride in calling themselves 'Open Source' but from the inside are almost as restrictive as a proprietary licensed system. A restriction is what it is, 'RESTRICTION' & just that. The GPL has been designed to take full advantage of these restrictions, resulting in the viral propogation of some of their core idealistic ideologies, and thus forces the software developers to release their intellectual property rights. Again, had developers been given an option, I am sure many would have found it reasonable enough to give all their code away. But, Freedom of choice & Forceful compulsion are two very opposite things. The core of the opensource is supposed to be 'Freedom'! And by freedom, it is meant to be broad, touching 100% of the users without any bias. There is nothing like 99% freedom. It either is freedom, or it just isn't. For software developers, their freedom to protect their own intellectual propery rights have been crushed, leaving a dirty (& viral) footprint of the GPL over it. Unfortunately, The Free Software Foundation fails to follow what it preaches & fails at it badly. These are FREEDOM-LESS licenses & are diametrically opposite to the wonderful permissive open source licenses like Apache 2.0, BSD, MIT & even MPL. Ironocially, The GPL is , in this respect very much like the proprietary licenses, which it opposes. Then again, Proprietary softwares only live as long as it is good enough for the end users,  who then continue buying licenses, thus funding further refinement of the softwares involved. So, many of these end up as amazing applications focussed at getting things done. This is probably where, these proprietary softwares compensate for their own restrictiveness. BUT, GPL' ed softwares end up empty handed at this point too, because of their own contradicting ideologies & skewed principles. It ends up being a victim of its own-self, & nothing else. I just hope that one day, the FSF guys wake up to a new morning, where they at-least decide, for once,  to never again row two different boats at the same time. Irrespective of whichever boat they choose, they would at least be better off, than continuing with their present ideologies & principles.

All of the companies behind Linux were always pushing it as a server technology.  Few companies were considering the desktop world for Linux and those that were were small time players and not companies at Google scale.  Interestingly enough, Linux dominates its intended market today and has a GPL license.

When picking Android you aren't just picking Android, you're also picking a device with a significant price difference from the competitor.  If Linux wanted to compete in the desktop world they couldn't do it on price since MS was already on all desktops at all price points.

By the time we had smartphones, companies knew the value of having your own OS.  When desktop OSs were starting up nobody thought there was any money in them so nobody cared about bringing a desktop solution to market.  By the time Microsoft showed everyone that there was indeed a market for desktop operating systems it was too late for any competitor.  Android was entering a far younger market.  A market in which many people had not yet even purchased a smartphone.

The first iPhone shipped in 2007.  The first Android phone shipped in 2008.  By contrast, the first windows desktop shipped in 1985.  The first Linux release was 1991.  6 years of catching up is a lot to do.

Unfortunately javascript module loading is a pain in the browser.  Its not as simple as nodejs where you can just drop something in node_modules and require it.

Since the browser can't scan a directory listing for a module you have to set up a mapping from the module name to its path.  At the top of https://github.com/tantaman/Strut/blob/master/app/scripts/main.js all of the module names are mapped to a path.  E.g., jquery is mapped like: `jquery: ""../scripts/libs/jQuery""`  

Let me know if that makes sense.

By the way, when I first start up Strut, Chrome gives me this warning ""[the website] wants to permanently store large data on your local computer"".

I've tried running the same in Firefox. There the images do show up in presentation mode. The strange behaviour of not immediately showing up on the slide is reproduced though.

For my little project it's required to have an ability to assign custom css classes to slides. This way, you could do really powerful stuff–from changing backgrounds and having themes and master styles to even transitions and animations within one slide.

Any style management controls (like background picker) would have their own set of classes, starting with a single prefix. For backgrounds it might be bg-red, bg-blue, etc., for borders bg-solid, bg-none, etc, for animations anim-blur, anim-fade, etc. – you've got the idea. So, the control (e.g. background picker) would only assign/remove certain classes from the slide. I think it's possible to abstract this very well in order to have adding new set of controls quite easily.

Just FYI: my ultimate goal is to create an animation editor for elements within one slide. Custom css classes of a slide would serve as keyframes. You'd end up with something like this to make elements move around (such code would hopefully auto-generated):

``` css
.slide1 #my-element {
  transition: all 1s;
}

.slide1 .state1 #my-element {
  top: 0px;
}

.slide1 .state2 #my-element {
  top: 1000px;
}
```

But obviously, I need a way to assign 'state1' and 'state2' to a slide. And most importantly, I need to do it in a way that doesn't break anything inside Strut guts.

Hope it all make sense.

That is a good idea for the animations and is actually similar to how the per-surface background images work.
When Strut generates a presentation with surface images it also generates a stylesheet that looks something like:

I also removed some unneeded triggering of `select` events (https://github.com/tantaman/Strut/commit/1d7f0053e030ce9d29665f768a99c07e3e8f1dc6#L0L122)

These JSDoc comments really help a lot to understand how everything works, especially if you're new to the project.

Yeap, it actually does break selection on undo/redo. Here's scenario:

(given you have 5 slides)
1. Select 1,2, so they all look like this:
   [slide] < _active_
   [slide] < _selected_
   [slide]
   [slide]
   [slide]
2. Drag them one slide below. Everything should look like this:
   [slide]
   [slide] < active
   [slide] < selected
   [slide]
   [slide]
3. Select 4th:
   [slide]
   [slide] < active
   [slide] < selected
   [slide] < _selected_
   [slide]
4. Drag all below so that they look like this:
   [slide]
   [slide] 
   [slide] < active
   [slide] < selected
   [slide] < selected
5. Undo:
   [slide]
   [slide] < active
   [slide] < selected
   [slide] < selected
   [slide]
6. Undo again:
   [slide] < active
   [slide] < selected
   [slide] 
   [slide] < selected
   [slide]

As you see, 4th one is still selected. But it shouldn't. Uncommenting https://github.com/tantaman/Strut/commit/9c4f43d8ceed7a554776c46fc35d12842db60cff#L0R81 and https://github.com/tantaman/Strut/commit/9c4f43d8ceed7a554776c46fc35d12842db60cff#L0R91 solves the issue.

Appreciate your work! Thanks!
For me, the biggest problem is that the placement of the slides in 'Present' mode is different than the placement of the slides in the 'Overview' mode (see difference in screenshots 3 and 4). The content of the slides in 'Slides' mode is the same as in the 'Present' mode, so I can live with that (but you already fixed it :-) ).

Because the placement of the slides in 'Present' mode is different than the placement of the slides in the 'Overview' mode, it is almost impossible to make the presentation you want. For me, this is basic functionality.

Again, I appreciate your work. So to do something (really small, because I'm no programmer, sorry) in return, I will translate the program in dutch. Despite this is the wrong place to ask, can you tell me how I can change the language now? Or does it take automatically the language of the used browser?

I've changed it to export a pretty-printed JSON.

The fix is in the Strut re-write
(http://tantaman.github.io/Strut/dist-rewrite/)
so if your presentation was created with a previous version of Strut you'll have to:

find: `""ImageModel""`
replace width: `""Image""`
(with quotes and case-sensitive)

on your JSON file in order to import it.

Hopefully I'll find some more time to make the re-write backwards compatible with older exports.  Doesn't seem like it should be too hard...

If you want to save your presentation in an regular file on your machine that you can copy and move around you can do ""Slideshow -> Export to JSON.""   To open a presentation you exported you can do ""Slideshow -> Import from JSON.""

It'll probably be a layer on top of require.js that'll let you specify a symbolic name instead of the location of a module.

So your code will say  `require('PresentationBundle', function(PresentationBundle) {})` and `PresentationBundle` will resolve to Impress or Jmpress or whatever else says it can provide the services of a PresentationBundle.

And hopefully at runtime you'll be able to change your mind on who should be the implementer of `PresentationBundle`

I'm glad to hear that!  Yeoman has gone through a lot of changes lately so it doesn't always work as expected.  They are finally getting close to their 1.0 release so things should be better in the future.

I've update the **rewrite** branch of Strut to use Yeoman v1.0 and I've even tested it out on Windows.

So, if you are developing on the **rewrite** branch of Strut then you can use Yeoman v1.0 and, contrary to what they say on their website, it does work on Windows.

To get the **rewrite** branch of Strut building:
1. Install the latest Yeoman, grunt & bower: `npm install -g yo grunt-cli bower`
2. Clone Strut: `git clone git://github.com/tantaman/Strut.git`
3. `cd Strut`
4. `git checkout rewrite`
5. Install Strut's development dependencies: `npm install`
6. Run Strut: `grunt server`

Those commands, and Yeoman, will work on Windows if you run them from MinGW / Git Bash.

If you'll be adding PDF export I'd take a look at adding it as a ""strut.PresentationGenerator"" although we can go over the details of how to make it conform to the strut.PresentationGenerator interface later.

Let me know if you have any problems.

Do you know if it is possible to provoke browsers offering the download instead as showing it as a text file?
Because most users don't know that one can actually save stuff the browser is showing via menu / _Ctrl-S_, and it also closes Strut (it has to be reloaded when you go back; this could be circumvented with a __blank_ target, but a download popup would be nicer, especially because the user can easily set the file name then).

Apart from that, I get an error in Chromium when opening the _Export to JSON_ panel (Firefox works well):

```

The download option works in Chrome but I haven't tested it in Chromium.  It seems like google fixes a bunch of stuff for Chrome but not Chromium... (there are lots of iframe bugs in Chromium that Chrome doesn't have, for example).

For instance, check out part of the [Unhosted presentation](http://unhosted.org/slides/intro#7.1) (advance with arrow keys) – that’s something that should be possible in Strut also.

Regarding UI for that, maybe it should be presented by something like »slide groups« – it basically is one slide with subslides (which you could collapse in the slides list and which would be one element in the Overview).

Of course also vice versa, the currently selected slide or last selected slide in Overview should also be focused when switching to Slides view.

And, I don’t think that’s possible at the moment but would be cool – also preserve the slide position when you are in the Presentation and switch back to Slides view.

While it's no problem for me to personally create separate files to have links to different presentations, the main benefit of Strut is that you don't need to know any code to be able to put together presentations.

The main need for the people I work with is to be able to create these presentations in Strut, and then hopefully save these from Strut, and immediately have a link to that presentation. I believe that's what @jancborchardt was talking about.

Is this in the pipeline / anticipated? If so – that would be amazing – if not, I'd love to know sooner rather than later.

I've only just come across both of these projects today, so haven't had a tonne of time to look into the source (not that I could be of tremendous help anyway) – but if exporting as a zip isn't as hard to implement as I imagine it to be, then consider this a +1 for that feature.

there is a ""zip presentation"" option under the ""Slideshow"" menu.

Notes about the zip:
- The zip will only include the html, css and javascript
- Images are not bundled into the zip and are instead linked (e.g., `<img src=""url/to/image"">`)
- The same goes for fonts and videos
- This functionality hasn't been fully tested

Chrome restricts a page's access to the filesystem so if you are running Strut from your local filesystem Chrome won't let you create the zip.  Firefox does not have this issue.  There is a workaround to fix this in Chrome (`--allow-file-access-from-files`) which I can explain if it is important to you.  

If you're planning on downloading/pulling this set of changes they currently only exist in the [zip](https://github.com/tantaman/Strut/tree/zip) and [gh-pages](https://github.com/tantaman/Strut/tree/gh-pages) branches.

I got around this the other day by saving the .json and images to a WebDAV directory but it would be even better if Strut could save directly to WebDAV as a folder in a format that can be launched from that folder and also saves the .json.

I have always just assumed that each domain gets its own section of local storage, maybe that was a wrong assumption.
Are you running Strut from localhost?  Maybe you have another application under localhost that is saving items under the daemon keys?

Assuming that it is another application cluttering localstorage I could maintain a ""StrutIndex"" (in localstorage) that can be used to keep track of which files Strut has saved.

This happens with Strut on Github, and also with Litewrite and WYSIHTML5.

From the value, it’s clear that Github runs Chartbeat, which in turn injects those keys: in »settingsDaemon« it says »chartbeatSampleRate« among other things.
A quick solution would just to hardcode-ignore those 4 values, but if someone sets up Strut on their own domain in a subfolder or so, just iterating over the values might not be the best thing anyway.

But actually, I think using remoteStorage.js would solve that problem altogether as the getList method only gets stuff in the specific scope (in this case, probably »presentations« is best). Is that correct cc @michielbdejong

I’ll experiment with the design a bit there, will be back (note to self: use ↻ instead of »Rot.«, rename »z« to something like »layer« or similar).
Regarding scale and depth/layer control – I think this is in another issue already, but the scale should reflect in the actual size of the slide. And the layer should probably be visualized through brightness or opacity (the higher the slide, the brighter and vice versa). Oh also, layer and scale should be possible to change by dragging on the label, much like the rotation values. What do you think?

Another cut/copy issue: It is not possible to copy any text from a text field.

Does the following also work: When a piece of text is in the clipboard, from another text field inside strut or from somewhere else – and there isn’t a specific text field selected (or just no text field on the current slide – is it possible to create a new text field with that text inside?

3 ideas for that:
1) let’s remove the text align (center, left, right) altogether or 2) make it a toggle (only left and center)

Also, the bar should be a bit transparent to not completely obstruct the background. For example .8 opacity.

Basically the thing is: The »save« and »save as« functions should be deprecated, everything should be autosaved. Automatic saving is the only form of saving. Ideally, when someone uses Ctrl+s, that should force a save (and suppress the default function that a system file saving dialog pops up).
It should be replaced by just a presentation list: all the presentations, plus a function to add a new one. (Like the simple document list on [Litewrite](http://litewrite.net) [you have to hover the top left].)

https://github.com/unhosted/remoteStorage.js/tree/v0.7

it doesn't do the syncing yet, i'm still working on that, but there
are already experimental 'tasks' and 'documents' modules.

have a look in the 'example' directory, do those make sense?
especially the 'litewrite' example should be a good starting point for
strut, i think? or should we create a new 'presentations' module that
does special presentations-specific things that don't apply to normal
(text) documents?

so because sync is ""behind"" the modules with remoteStorage.js 0.7, the app architecture is a matter of:
- putting domain code into the module (notes.js in the example)
- send controller actions to the module
- update the DOM only when the module gives you a change event

here are reference docs:

if you look at how https://github.com/RemoteStorage/remoteStorage.js/blob/master/example/minimal/notes.js does it, you see it allows the app to set something, and get it back. This will work even if the user is not connected (!). it will just use localStorage or IndexedDB in that case, and this is entirely transparent (!) to the app.

when the page loads, the app simply asks the module for the user's data, whether that is local or remote does not matter at this point. Then, if/when the user connects, at a random moment during the use of the app, any data that is fetched from remote then is passed on to the app for display using the on('change') handler:

Basically the issue is that it doesn't buffer a preview, if I am correct you need to make sure you have the following in the class where you inherit QRCodeReaderDisplayable

`   @objc func orientationDidChange() {
        setNeedsDisplay()
        overlayView?.setNeedsDisplay()

Yes it works, but Swift 3.1 has break the previous `QRCodeReaderViewController` lazy initialisation. Now you should init it like that:

```swift
lazy var readerVC: QRCodeReaderViewController = {

      $0.reader = QRCodeReader(metadataObjectTypes: [AVMetadataObjectTypeQRCode], captureDevicePosition: .back)
   }

I've just tried this way below to customize the interface. Hope it works for you guys too.

- Step 1: make sure you can use (inherit) QRCodeReader classes (I used to ""pod"" this but it didn't work so I copied all classes to my project. You know how to deal if you got the same prob).

- Step 2: Go to QRCodeReaderViewController, add any customization you want in viewWillAppear function. (Unlock the file if asked).

- Step 3: (Might be skipped) I got UI prob with presenting readerVC so I changed to pushing it by:
+ Replace present present(readerVC, animated: true, completion: nil) by self.navigationController?.pushViewController(readerVC, animated: true) 
+ Replace dismiss(animated: true, completion: nil) by readerVC.navigationController?.popViewController(animated: true).

- Step 4: (Optional) Go to QRCodeReaderViewControllerBuilder to disable/enable any default UI components by changing true -> false and vice versa. (If you disable a component, you should comment its action function).

A question about the example app - is there a reason that the QR view controller is saved as a variable in the main view controller?

It might take a little more time, so I just copied&pasted zoom code. You should use `videoMaxZoomFactor` instead of `4.0`. (You can also add slider to zoom/release.)

With Xcode8 you need to specify the `SWIFT_VERSION` for each lib and targets and Cocoapods (`1.1.0.rc.2` and over) provides a `.swift-version` file to do so. I think some libraries are almost the same in Swift 2.3 and Swift 3 and Xcode can deals with.

By waiting for the Cocoapods 1.1.0, you can manually set the `SWIFT_VERSION` for the problematic pods?

The scan is asynchronous so when you call the `getQRCode` method it does not wait for a response.

Here an example how to resolve your issue:

``` swift

The Function ""myFunc"" has to return the boolean value and the value relates to gotten QR Code.

I'm going to make the function as follows.

``` swift

Sorry for the late (I'm in holidays), but yes this is the normal behaviour. There is a gradiant that is auto applied to the color. For the moment to avoid it you'll need to use the `progressTintColors` instead of `progressTintColor` and set the same left and right color.

However now (after 4 years of existence) I think this is a wrong behaviour. To fix it without breaking the API I'm going to add a new property to have an uniform color.

It looks a little goofy between 0 - 11 but then the text adjusts its self on the status bar. I recommend this should be made as a option for others to turn on/off.

Attached a screenshot with this. Please check.

Since the last version, the YLProgressBar inherits from UIView instead of UIProgressView (because of iOS7).
That's why the inspector does not show any information about the YLProgressBar. So you have 2 choices:
- Adding the class in the inspector manually
- Or put an UIView (and add the YLProgressBar in the inspector) instead of the UIProgressView into your views

Hope it'll help

How would you go about checking for any of these states?

For this question, I'm advising to use `===` only and not use `==`. Because if you want to check if a value is `null`, using `==` will also give you `true` if the value was `undefined`.

For example, one common case is an API  modifying objects in a database API. If a function has a signature of `function modifyUserInDatabase({ id, name, age })` and you call it like:

```js
modifyUserInDatabase({ id: 1, name: 'Rob', age: null }); // name: 'Rob', age: null
// In this case, age is null and you will want to see the age database column to null
```

```js
modifyUserInDatabase({ id: 1, name: 'Rob' }); // name: 'Rob', age: undefined
// In this case, age is not passed in, meaning you don't want to touch that column at all
```

For the above case, you will need to use strict equality otherwise you are unable to distinguish between setting a value to `null` (with the intention of resetting the value) vs not setting the value at all.

For other cases, if you just want to know if something is `null` or `undefined`, then `==` is ok.

Hope that explains the difference.

I'm not native English speaker . I'm Japanese. I understood after reading under link

In the phrase ""substitute X for Y"", to use X in place of Y. With increasing frequency used in the semantically opposite sense

but in Japanese Translation, that is opposite meaning. so it is necessary to amend.
At first I read Japanese answers, and I got strange because the answer use XML, we are using JSON.

now I watched English. I wanted to say is that correctly.

When you define a public method on the prototype of class/function it gets shared by its instances. While public methods/members defined on instances e.g. `this.getName`, is generated for each instance separately.
That also means that any instance is able to override/change prototype methods. Which can be dangerous in a shared memory scenario.

Css media queries are typically used to determine the screen width and items may be hidden, resized and/or re-ordered as the width of the browser window changes.

An alternative to responsive is a fluid layout. Fluid layouts generally reflow the page containers width and height without hiding or disabling features on to fit smaller screen sizes. 

""Mobile First"" is a design strategy. In mobile first, the site design is based on the limitations of a supported range of mobile devices. Starting with mobile constraints forces the design to focus on presenting relevant content to the user over flashy effects. Progressive enhancement is used to add features, effects and sometimes additional content as the screen space grows. A mobile first design will be responsive once those additional features are added.

Sites that are designed starting at the desktop size follow the opposite strategy of ""mobile first"". The design focuses on the desktop sizes and features that are available on that platform. ""Graceful degradation"" is then used to remove/adjust features as the screen width is reduced.

Whether you start with mobile or desktop as a design strategy, providing support for various screen widths results in a responsive web site.

Blurred pictures are generally the source of the error. You can certainly ""upgrade"" the original source code that I provide to further categorize a face in more regions (up, down, up-left, down-left); should be fairly easy since the code I provided already breaks a face into 3 parts: left, center, right.

As for face detection, no open source face detection is perfect. I found mtcnn to be the best one I've tried so far that's why I implemented it for this repo. However, you might find opencv open source facial detection to be better at detecting side faces. I do warn you that there will be a lot of false positives with opencv face detection though. Again, mtcnn works best and smoothly for me with a GPU; that's why I chose it.

the facial recognition process. However, implementing this wouldn't be too
difficult.

The current implementation generates 128D vector of a face, then compare
the distance of that vector to the ones stored in the user dataset. If the
distance to the closest vector in the dataset satisfies the distance
threshold (which is set to 0.6 by default), the person in the image would
then be ""labeled"" accordingly.

I'm assuming that you are referring to the feature which exists in Android
FaceID, or Apple FaceID. To implement something like that, you would have
to add a method to tune the current 128D vector in the dataset as the
person gets recognized by the program. This isn't difficult but it will
require some rigorous real-world testing to find an optimal algorithm.

Hope this helps!

Sorry for the delayed reply. Wish you a happy new year.

I tried playing around with this. The issue seemed to be with OpenCV. After reinstalling it, it is now resolved. CV2 was working fine for a lot of basic example codes that I used to check it out. Anyway, the re-installation helped.

Two things that I have come across further are-
1. While using input mode, to save a new face, after pressing 'q' to save and add the face, the frame hangs.
System configuration is: 6th gen i7, 16GB RAM, 4 GB GTX960M

2. While running the application, after some time (close to 30 seconds), I am getting this error and the application turns off. This seems to be an issue. Kindly provide your suggestions for this.

> There's an inherent risk to using an image in the QR Code. Specifically the risk is that it takes away too much of the actual scannable portion. By excavating (as seems to be the difference in your demos) you're actually taking away even more modules, not just the ones that are getting covered by the image. I don't have any protections in there to prevent embedding an image that covers up more than the error correction level can handle (the math got messy, transparent images change the math) so if you find yourself with a QR Code that doesn't scan, you need to correct that yourself. You have 2 options:

> 1. Change the ratio of QR Code to image size. Make the image smaller or the QR Code bigger.
> 2. Increase the Error level (level), which will result in smaller modules with a better ability to handle covered areas.

You can use transparency in your PNG to make it look round. In that case you would not want to excavate.

The default behavior of image embeds is to simply overlay on top of the rendered QR Code. This leaves partial modules visible, which might not be what you want (and may interfere with scanners' ability to read the QR Code). `excavate` changes the approach used, and will find any of those partially covered modules and replace them with the provided background color. You can see the behavior if you look at the demo (https://zpao.github.io/qrcode.react/). For cases of transparency as you may be thinking about, this might be pretty awkward since we use the rectangular image dimensions to do that excavation.

Specifically the risk is that it takes away too much of the actual scannable portion. By excavating (as seems to be the difference in your demos) you're actually taking away even more modules, not just the ones that are getting covered by the image. I don't have any protections in there to prevent embedding an image that covers up more than the error correction level can handle (the math got messy, transparent images change the math) so if you find yourself with a QR Code that doesn't scan, you need to correct that yourself. You have 2 options:

1. Change the ratio of QR Code to image size. Make the image smaller or the QR Code bigger.

The result was that both; iOs Google Authenticator and Android Google Authenticator (on the same phones and OSes as stated in the first comment) returned the same 2fa: 106 251. I think you can try them by yourself using the images.

UDPATE 1:
Also, the example provided at the ""google/google-authenticator"" github page, found here https://rootprojects.org/authenticator/ will generate on both Google Auths (iOs and Android) same results.

UPDATE 2:
Testing with Authy (https://authy.com/) on the image provided in the first comment, then one with the text code INWT... (so generated by qrcode.react) worked well - Authy installed on both iOs and Android generated the same 2fa code.

how can I specify sha1 as the algorithm, so that Google Auth won't get confused on both iOs and Android? I've looked into the docs and didn't find any algo param.  As I understand from you that this is the default algo expected.

I am trying to do something similar to what @Angelk90 is doing but could not make it work from my case.

I want to render a QR code generated on the flyto a PDF. For generating pdf I am using [`react-pdf/renderer`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@react-pdf/renderer).

Here is my code - 

```javascript
import React from ""react"";
import {Page, Text, View, Document, StyleSheet, Image} from ""@react-pdf/renderer"";
import QRCode from ""qrcode.react"";

export function PdfDocument(props) {
    return (
        <Document>
        <Page size=""A4"">    
          <View>
            <Text>Section #1</Text>
          </View>
          <View>
            <Text>Section #2</Text>
            <QRCode value=""Hello"" />
            
          </View>
        </Page>
      </Document>
    );
}
```

But I am getting the following error - 

`Error: Invalid element of type canvas passed to PDF renderer`


From what I understand I think I need to convert the QR code to a `png` or `jpeg` before rendering it to a pdf. But I am not sure how to do it?

> helps editors discover the propTypes for the components

To be fair, I think we could just add `propTypes` to the wrapper component and get the same thing :)

Now to the real point… it's kind of an awkward API. I was tempted to split out of the single file and just expose `qrcode.react/canvas` and `qrcode.react/svg` instead of 2 exports on a single module, though I guess it's not terribly different. No idea how that would work with building CJS & ES modules though, presumably some of the same problems?

1. We're much closer to mainstream builds being able to use ESM. This is a good step towards that.

The goal was to create a download component that received token and id props from which a QR code would be generated. This code uses React Router's `<Link>` API's `innerRef: RefObject` to get the underlying ref of the component.

```
import React, { Component } from 'react'
import QRCode from 'qrcode.react';
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';

class Download extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.serviceKey = props.serviceKey;
    this.token = props.token;
  }

  codeClassName = `QRCode-${this.props.serviceKey}`;

  refCallback(node){
    const nodeId = node.title;
    {/* use an html attribute (in this case, title) to get a unique id from the props passed to component */}
    const canvas: any = document.querySelector(`.QRCode-${nodeId} > canvas`);
    node.href = canvas.toDataURL();
    node.download = `TipGuru-QRCode-${nodeId}.png`;
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        {/* hide the QR code if there's no need to render in the view */}
        <div hidden className={this.codeClassName}>
          <QRCode
             value={this.token}
             size={1024}
          />
        </div>
        {/* Use html attributes to pass in any required data to the ref node. Note: target: '_blank' was required in order to initiate the download dialogue */}
        <Link to=""/"" target='_blank' title={this.serviceKey} innerRef={this.refCallback}>
            <i className=""mdi mdi-download mdi-list-icon""></i>
        </Link>

I took another look at the README and I now realize this is probably not part of public API. Specifically, reading `e.refs.canvas` is likely not officially supported. Generally you should only access your own refs, and reading deeper refs is breaking encapsulation and generally not considered part of component public API. 

I think that before this can be merged, there should be an official API for getting the URL. For example, it could be an instance method on the component. This would require that @zpao is interested in adding this API.

I'm not a maintainer btw, just happened to be passing by and thought I'd leave a few comments while @zpao is busy with other projects. I'm not sure how to move this forward but I hope the above comments were at least a tiny bit helpful.

And thanks @gaearon for taking the time to look at it! I'll second most of what he said, and most importantly, the public API part. I think it's awesome that you found a way to make this work without needing an official API but it's not super future proof. If React stops supporting string refs, or we didn't render a `<canvas>` directly in this component, it would stop working. Also, there are potential timing issues - since we actually update the DOM in `componentDidMount/Update`, if you access the ref at the wrong time it might not have the correct data yet. So I think a public API is in required.

I think the best API might be a callback prop (maybe named something like `onDataURLChange`) that we call after we update the canvas data. This would avoid the timing issue and would actually end up with pretty much the same example component you already wrote (since you used callback refs 🎉). We might need to decide if we want to support non-default values for `toDataURL`, but I think we could probably just stick to the defaults for now and if it becomes an issue, add more props later.

Would you be interested in adding that API? (or if you have other API ideas, let me know and we can chat). Feel free to bikeshed on an API name too, I'm not attached to anything yet.

I tested React 15 before shipping the latest version and just updated the gh-pages branch with a new bundle using React 15.2.1. http://zpao.github.io/qrcode.react/ seems to be working fine.

This change you're proposing is fine long term but won't work in older versions of React and I don't feel the need to break those quite yet. Maybe soon though - don't think we'll add too many more features here.

    },
    handleSizeChange(event) {

I've found this issue when I was attempting to remove the hard-coded width and height attributes from the SVG output to have a responsive SVG. It's aways more ideal to not have to add more CSS to undo other styles.

I am aware that a class and/or styles can be added for responsive design. 

Un/fortunately, I'm using TypeScript and the definitions haven't been updated to allow additional props beyond the defaults: https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/blob/master/types/qrcode.react/index.d.ts

Thus… it sure would be great to have a `responsive` param to disable hard coded `width` and `height` attributes in the output…

```jsx
<QRCode responsive={true} value=""foobar"" />
```

Or — a breaking change, but simpler API — make the `size` param optional such that if not used, there are no `width` and `height` attributes on the output svg or canvas code.

My current solution with TypeScript is to use styled-components to create a wrapper `div` tag and use it to style the descendent `svg` element.

Posting here in the hopes it is helpful to others:

```jsx
// components/QRCode.tsx
import QRCodeReact from 'qrcode.react'
import React from 'react'
import styled from 'styled-components'

const ResponsiveSvgWrapper = styled.div`
  & > svg {
    display: block; /* svg is ""inline"" by default */
    height: auto; /* reset height */
    width: 100%; /* reset width */
  }
`

interface Props {
  value: string
}

const QRCode = ({ value }: Props) => (
  <ResponsiveSvgWrapper>
    <QRCodeReact renderAs=""svg"" value={value} />
  </ResponsiveSvgWrapper>
)

export default QRCode
```

Usage:

```jsx
import QRCode from '../components/QRCode'

// Use in render() method…
<QRCode value=""MyVoiceIsMyPassword"" />

I rebased this branch on latest master and pushed the updated commit here with author preserved as @cssivision  https://github.com/scmx/qrcode.react/commit/ea1c2d31fbe556e3e4ecfa6e09e72196b700661b
(I also tweaked the if-statements to please `flow` regarding `ctx`)

@zpao Are you interested in having this feature?
@cssivision Your library https://github.com/cssivision/qrcode-react with image support works great, but it's currently throwing some react warnings https://github.com/cssivision/qrcode-react/issues/1, so I thought perhaps it would be possible to merge the two packages if this pull request was merged.

From what I can see the only thing that's missing now is the `logoWidth` and `logoHeight`. I can add a commit for that as well if you like?
