Is it possible to add multiple directories or furthermore possible to have ICE search through multiple levels?  Perhaps I could point it to the Games folder in the config file and when pointing it to the PSP folder in the handheld subdir, still have it find the roms?  

The alternative is that I re arrange my entire rom collection which Id imagine many use something similar.  Mine is sync'd between several pc's and dropbox so its a bit of a hassle butl likely no more than adding this capability if it doesnt already exist lol.

If I were to add another Directory= beneath the initial one in config.txt would it potentially scan both or?

Loving the program so far. 

I've just got one problem in that I have a bunch of dreamcast ROMs that are .gdi which are also accompanied by track01.bin, track02.raw & track03.bin files which I normally keep in a named folder. 
However, these aren't detected by Ice in contrast to the .cdi ROMs which are detected fine in the main dreamcast folder. Because the track files are all the same for each ROM, I can't have multiple of the same name in the same folder, is there a way I can get Ice to detect the .gdi ROMs? 

Also mentioned in other issues, consolegrid doesn't seem to allow uploading at the moment. 

I have tried using the 'images directory=C:\' line in consoles.txt and I have placed an image file in the relevant system in both correctly sized jpg and png formats but when running ice again - they don't seem to show up. Is anyone else experiencing this also?

I ran Ice the first time and everything worked beautifully, except that no ROMs had images associated with them in Steam Big Picture because I hadn't bothered to go through and clean-up/verify all the ROM file names to match ConsoleGrid.

The Genesis ROMs were the one exception. All but one of them were named correctly and pulled the correct images from ConsoleGrid. So I went into my ROMs\Genesis directory and renamed that errant ROM to what ConsoleGrid called it. I also, realized that I wanted my retro game emulator shortcuts all grouped in the Steam filters, so I also tagged ""Retro"" on the head of each console title in consoles.exe (e.g.: ""Nintendo Entertainment System"" & ""Super Nintendo"" became ""Retro Nintendo NES"" & ""Retro Nintendo SNES"")... I ran Ice again and was happy to see that the old Steam categories were deleted and replaced with the new ones, and all the Genesis ROMs now had the correct images.

So then I decided to take on the chore of going through and cleaning up all the NES filenames. I got them all fixed and even found a few additional ROMs that I forgot to add initially, so I renamed them and added them to my ROMs directory. I saw that Ice found the images on ConsoleGrid for almost all the NES ROMs. I then renamed a few of those that were still wrong and ran Ice again. I'm pretty sure it pulled those images, too. But when I opened Steam Big Picture, the shortcuts all still had the old names and no images. I wondered if renaming the console titles caused the refresh before, so I replaced ""Retro"" with ""Emu"" on all of them & ran Ice again. It now gives me an error at the end that the image source is unavailable, though it is. And when I open Steam Big Picture, the shortcuts are unchanged, as are the console titles/categories.

I did find the directory where the images are stored and it seems to have most or all of the images for the renamed ROMs, But the shortcuts are pointing to the wrong ROM files and will not update like they did the first time

I'm not a pro at any of this and I'm kinda speaking with ignorance, so forgive me. Mainly I want PCSX2 to work with different INI configs as so many games for PCSX2 need different settings.

I've had it for a while now and have mainly playing games casually. Games that don't have much saving per se like NES games like Super Mario Bros. 1-3 using Nestopia or fighting games like Killer Instinct or any of the various Mortal Kombat games on SNES using BSNES. 

However, upon playing games that DO save such as the Zelda and Metroid games on NES and SNES, they DON'T SAVE. That is to say that I cannot save a game, press the Xbox guide button and exit the ""game"" to choose another or stop playing all together for the time being. Upon loading the game back up through SBP the save has not stuck! In order to save I must manually close the emu by going into windowed mode and closing through File, close or using some combo of keys on the keyboard. 

The only emu's I currently use are EPSXE for PS1, BSNES for SNES, Project64 for N64, Dolphin for Gamecube/Wii and Nestopia for NES.

I can confirm, of the emus I listed, that SAVING IS FINE for PJ64, Dolphin and EPSXE. Nestopia does not and BSNES does not (Snes9x as well) save for me at the moment. 

Anyone else experience this and is there a solution playing their ROMs through Steam Big Picture?

Thats awesome, but one of the big problems for Ice is that it cant be running while Steam is running, and Steam is slightly too important for the startup path to just delay while Ice downloads images for 5000 ROMs.

But the only thing we need Steam closed for is syncing shortcuts, and that is super quick. So since its safe, lets provide a command line option to launch Steam again after we're done syncing shortcuts.

For this I have to change the locations of the log files. Moving the error log works like expected when changing it in the main, but the ice.log is a different story.

In ice_logging.py setting the filename used by class IceLogger to /tmp/ice.log works great, but when you set it to /home/user/ice.log it will convert it into ~/ice.log for some reason. At some point within logger os.path.abspath(filename) is run, which will convert this into /home/user/~/ice.log if your working directory is /home/user.

I'm not sure why this conversion happens, maybe someone here does. I'm still looking into it, but it looks like I may just have to log to /tmp.

I don't know anything about programing, but i was trying to see if i could manage to use Xebra with Ice. I did manage to find a  solution, but it's not the perfect method, is more like a workaround.

If anyone knows how to make it work like the other emulators, please let me know.

Ok, here's what i did:

consoles.txt:
[Playstation]
nickname=Playstation
emulator=Xebra
extensions=bin

emulators.txt:

[Xebra]
location=C:\Emulators\Xebra\XEBRA.EXE
command=%l C:\Emulators\Xebra\XEBRA.EXE -FULL -IMAGE ""C:ROMs\Playstation\Crash Team Racing [SCUS-94426].bin"" -RUN1

[Xebra]
location=C:\Emulators\Xebra\XEBRA.EXE
command=%l C:\Emulators\Xebra\XEBRA.EXE -FULL -IMAGE ""C:ROMs\Playstation\Vigilante 8 - 2nd Offensive [U] [SLUS-00868].bin"" -RUN1

If you pay attention, you will notice that I wrote ""one code"" for each game, and that's basically what you will have to do. For each game you wanna play, you will have to put a new code in the ""emulators.txt"", but you will have to point out the name of the rom and where it is located, changing the ""C:ROMs...."" part.

It's also important to notice that you have to point to the "".bin"" file, not .cue.

Xebra it's considered the most accurate PS1 emulator to date, so it's always good to have him working with Ice! 

Hope i could help, cheers!

This worked. I was able to run `ice.py`.

**In summary**, there might be something different now in linux Steam, therefore the userdata folder is located elsewhere, breaking the install.

Although ice does a good enough job of scaping consolegrid, if I have a game across multiple consoles it's impossible to tell what system it's on (if the scraped artwork is the same for example)
Adding an overlay to the scraped image would go some way to alleviate this and add consistent styles.
Or just want to know what emulator will launch a game (say you know the XYZ emulator is a bit buggy so you know not to expect miracles)
Would be happy enough if a separate steam library manager app were introduced (as you mentioned in other issue log). I've used steamgrid helper but it crashes on my large library, unsure if alternatives exist.

Unless consolegrid gets a massive overhual, adding features such as alternative names per game (eg international translations, ROM codes, Disc/CD support, tags, blocking images that aren't 460*215) and more api functions, I imagine an image picker would be great for smaller libraries in the GUI version!

Here is the error I'm experiencing:

The deletion was the hard part, as deleting a user's non-Ice shortcuts would be EXTREMELY bad. I always tried hard to ensure that I would only delete a shortcut if it was something Ice would make, but at the end of the day what I was really doing was guessing. No matter how good the heuristic it was always possible I would get something wrong.

Instead, I should write the history to disc. After a sync I can just write the state of the world to a file. Then on the next run I would know exactly what ROMs Ice manages and can make decisions accordingly. I would also like to support some form of undo in the future (in case Ice messes up terribly) so I should include a diff of what happened along with the final state. Maybe I could even keep multiple of these.

I'm almost getting into version control territory here so I should keep it small. Just something like the last 3 runs of Ice can be saved. I would also like the file format to be readable. At some point it could be useful to have them sent as logs if something terrible happens.

Also here is a working configuration for emulators.txt:

All of these games emulate fine and work great for me. 

I would like to know what I might be doing wrong with Dolphin and NullDC.

I want to be able to launch each game in fullscreen without having to bring up the emulator interface and choosing the iso each time. I seem to have that working on dolphin, however my games crash immediately. 

On NullDC I can't get the games to launch in full screen like the other emulators do. What do I need to type in my emulators.txt file to get my games to launch without the damn emulator interface popping up and requiring me to manually select the iso for each game negating the reason I am trying to launch these as stand alone games in the first place.

With project64 I had it working fine the first day, and now I can't get any games to work. It keeps crashing on me every time it launches a game...

I had the version from the download button on the official Ice page, then the next day I updated to the version found here and re-edited my emulators and consoles.txt to get everything working fine. 

Please respond guys this is driving me nuts.

Any help at all would be greatly appreciated.

Option B) Import only whitelisted extensions (.rom, .smc, .n64, .z64, etc)

Is it possible to add a PC category ? Maybe with another name, like cd-rom, iso or the name of the OS like win 95.

Integrating non-steam games in an automated fashion is a perfect idea!

I'm making a mame arcade machine for home use. Using steam as a front end would be perfect! It looks good, utilizes keystrokes to navigate, and integrates steam and non steam games!

Here is some suggestions that I think would allow Ice to integrate with steam, and would be much appreciated by the arcade community. Forgive me if a feature is already in the works or integrated.
- Multiple rom directories for one emulator (I have cave roms separate from roms)
- Read rom titles (mame roms and associated extra files are titled in an abbreviated code)
- Read roms from a generated list (so we can include only certain games within that directory)
- Allow for multiple lists or reading for catver.ini (with so many roms, we need categories)
- Generate steam pictures from mame marquees

Also, if you take a screenshot through the Steam wrapper in game, then it uses this as the background picture in the Steam library.  I was wondering if there would be a way to make these also download with Ice so that people don't have to go through screen capturing all their games.

- Consoles with an inaccessible ROMs directory to not show up in supported consoles

- Emulators default to '%l %r' for their command if none is given
- Quotes are added to the ROM location and the Emulator location in emulator commands

When logged in as the desktop user, Ice can't find Steam's userdata location without editing config.txt. 

Python's sys.platform returns ""linux2"". Steam is installed under the steam user, not the desktop user, so Ice's default ~/.local/share/Steam/userdata/ will not work if running it from the desktop user.

I think the best solution to a lot of issues would be running Ice as the steam user.

I was able to install SteamOS in a VM and then add the default Debian repositories to APT. I used vi to edit /etc/apt/sources.list. Then I installed Mednafen and configured it as the GBA emulator. The debian repositories are in this comment: http://steamdb.info/blog/35/#reply-1081

Steam won't use this as a target, (set as command in emulators.txt) I've checked out game properties to see if error is occurring during Ice compile, but no, target reads as it should.

Using Ice on a Win 8 machine. Very cool application, but I have had some issues. Starting BSnes just results in a blank black screen that I have to ESC from. No prompts to load games or anything, it may be a bad emulator. I believe BSnes has since evolved to Higan. I've downloaded this emulator and it works just fine, only I cannot configure Ice to use non-default emulators. I have added links to a couple suitable replacement emulators if you think it would be best.

""bsnes is the name for my SNES emulator, which has obtained 100% bug-free compatibility with the entire library of licensed games. It is now a part of the multi-emulator higan.""
http://byuu.org/higan/

Also, Gens emulator slaps around my screen without ever actually getting to functionality of loading a rom. I have found Fusion364 very useful (also supports multiple SEGA consoles [i.e. Sega MS, Genesis, CD, etc]. 

http://segaretro.org/Kega_Fusion 

I don't know if other users are having this issue, I did a quick glance over the issues list so I may have missed it. I think replacing the SNES/SEGA emulators with these may bring some stability to using it, or perhaps enable Ice to accept user preferred emulators by making some config file edits.

Thanks!

This removes the need for two files and removes a bit of the bloat in my opinion. I don't think it is necessary for Ice to know what the name of an emulator is, what the nickname is, etc. All that matters is what is being passed to Steam.

Also, I think it would be a great feature to specify console specific rom paths. I may have my PSX isos shared via a network drive in order to save space, but I may save my SNES games locally. This also again makes it to where Ice no longer needs to create a roms folder.

- Avoid double entries for games that come in a bin/cue pair
- Avoid double entries for Wii games; For big games, images can be split in a .wbfs file and .wbf1, .wbf2, etcetera. By just adding 'wbfs' to your extensions parameter

In the process of debugging all of the emulator related issues, I wondered why Ice was providing emulators in the first place. Ice shouldn't be trying to determine what the best emulators are for a given machine, or what control scheme the user will want to use. The whole point of Ice is to automate the process of adding ROMs to Steam as playable games. Thats it. Automatically downloading and configuring emulators doesn't fit with that at all.

As such, this is where I think I am going to go next:
- Ice no longer downloads emulators.
- The user provides all of the emulators in a file called emulators.txt. In practice, this means I only need two bits of information from the user: Where the emulator is stored and the formatting of the command
- The user provides all of the consoles in a file called consoles.txt. The consoles will have three attributes: their name, their folder name, and their emulator. For every console in this list, Ice will make a folder in ROMs that it will watch for games. When a game is in that folder, Ice will do its thing and add it to Steam.

In practice, I believe this change will mainly turn into implementing #71 and #70, and removing all of the 'downloaded emulator' code.

The goal of these changes to bring Ice more into a 'tool' category. A lot of my more recent code has been setting Ice up as an all-in-one solution. Looking back, I think that is a mistake. By doing too much I was making Ice mediocre at a lot of things. Instead, I should do one thing really well (automatically adding your ROMs to Steam) and let the user figure out how they want to actually play the ROMs.

It would be a great since it already uses the same emulator. Bsnes lets you emulate GBA GB GBC NES SNES and DS. if it makes your work easier for only needing one emulator.  But being so close! All you need is

The process and what I did:

I added my SNES roms to the appropriate rom sub folder and started the Ice.exe for it to add them to my Steam library. This completed fine and smoothly however when it was searching for the art on the internet to save, it broke around half way through and refused to continue, prompting for me to close it. When I attempted to restart it, it throws an indecipherable error to me and has henceforth refused to continue. I have since added roms to my ROMs folder but they are also not being added due to this error.

# CONFIG FILE
## Replaced # with \* for formatting issues

[Storage]
- The path to place your ROMs Directory. This can be in any drive or anywhere,
- as long as the full path is specified. Use ~ to represent your home folder
- (for example, C:\Users\Scott)
  *
- Ice will place a folder called ROMs at the specified location. 
- 
- Example:
- ~                     => C:\Users<YOUR USERNAME>\ROMs
- C:\                   => C:\ROMs
- C:\Program Files      => C:\Program Files\ROMs
- D:\Steam              => D:\Steam\ROMs
- D:\ROMs               => D:\ROMs\ROMs <-- It will work, but looks awful
  ROMs Directory=~

[Grid Images]
- The website listed should provide the grid images used by Ice. This URL will
- most likely need to be provided by the website itself, as it is fairly specific.
  *
- The default is ConsoleGrid (consolegrid.com/api/top_picture)
  *
- If this field is left blank, Ice will not attempt to download images

However, there is a great deal of ambiguity in how Ice works and how it's supposed to be configured.

For example:

""Using Ice:

1) Add ROMs into the correct directory based on the console. For example, if you
want to add Super Smash Bros, put the ROM into 'ROMs/N64'.
2) Make sure Steam is closed. If Steam is open, then Ice will do nothing
3) Run Ice again. Make sure that it finishes correctly.
4) Open Steam, and enjoy playing some old games!""

That's all we get when it comes to actually making the program work.

1) What is the ""correct directory"" for each console?  How can I know these names?  Is it Game Boy, Gameboy, or GB?  What about Game Boy Color, is that a different handheld?

2) Do we put the ROMs inside the folder ourselves, or does Ice scan for them and move the ROMs around?  Does it search only the ROMs folder or the entire computer?  This is unclear.

3) In config.txt it's stated that Ice will create a ROMs folder inside a specified directory.  But in my testing, the directory was never created at all.  Even when I manually created a ROMs directory, the program did not function.

4) Going on from 3, what exactly is the point of specifying and having Ice create a ROMs folder if the user has to manually put the ROMs into the correct location and sub-directories anyway?

I have tried insert images stored locally on my computer using the ""image"" button which  lets you browse.  I get an error that says the URL is wrong and the text field says ""unable to upload image to imgur"".  

steps to reproduce:

alternatively one can enter a file:///path/to/file.jpg in the form. but this seems to do nothing at all as the insert button does not respond to this.  Browsing is required to select the image.

regression:
dragging and dropping the file from the filesystem (linux) onto the strut.io slide does correctly insert the image.

entering a web URL including an URL from imgur or other website works.

I have verified I am correctly entering a local file URL path and the that the path doesn't have any illegal characters in it by first opening the image in firefox then copying the file:///URL from the firefox URL bar and pasting this into the Image browser test field.

I have tried doing this while firefox also is logged into IMGUR but this doens't seem to matter.

Installed Strut locally.
When wanting to insert a local, stored in a folder, figure (.svg, .png or .jpg) the ""insert image"" pop up box has the text ""Local images are currently uploaded to imgur. We're working on changing this"".
How can I insert local graphics and leave them locally stored (I don't want that my images are uploaded somewhere else than on my PC).
By the way, browsing and selecting a local stored image and then hit [open] reslts in the error ""Failed to upload image to imgur""

Thanks,

Long time user of Strut, apparently I broke something fierce. 
- I am able to add, re-order and remove slides.
- I am able to add elements (text, images, shapes, etc) from the top menu.
- I am able to change background and surface colours to the default choices, not able to specify new ones.
- Once an element is on the canvas, aside from moving it around via changing the x y value boxes or changing colours from the default choices offered, I have zero interaction with anything. I can't edit content, basically.
- In the overview tab I am able to play with content in the text boxes and change the x y orientation, any change to the z axis will take effect but when previewing the presentation the camera will not pivot to stay in front of the new slide.

i'm Moritz Schuchmann from the german company Deutsche Bahn. We want to build a business service for dynamic presentations and we're using strut as basic framework. First of all: Thumbs up for what you created till here!

Now, that we can make the prototype more custom for our service, i have a couple of questions (i hope they haven't been asked already, didn't find them):
1. Is there a simple way to add custom fonts and colors (of our corporate design) to the strut-editor?
2. Can we add our graphics (best would be svg-files) to the shapes in the editor? How would you do that?
3. Does strut.io has a function to create custom templates that our users can start building their presentations on?

Thank you very much

Sorry, I am not a good web developer and know quite less about Grunt, Node.js and so on.
I have been a Android and iOS developer for some time and currently I want and start to learn to set up my own blog site and want to integrate one ""HTML Presentation"" component to my future site.

For finding the right component, i get to know impress.js, reveal.js, deck.js and so on.
My result are presented here: http://isjohnwong.appspot.com/post/6013787169619968
As a result, Strut is the only satisfying open source editor for html presentation i found.

And here are some of my needs,
1. Integrate Strut in my website
   This is exactly somewhat the same as issues #321 and #319 .
   Well, to make it more clear, things like to host one copy of strut.io in my VPS. And i can use it under my blog domain.

2. Math Equation Support
   Comparing to MathJax, I prefer LaTeX.  Somewhat like #151 
3. Code syntax coloring and indenting
   Maybe integrad codemirror
4. Self-define html&css&js DIV box Support
   Somewhat like issue #3 , but not for the whole slide, only for one area.

Here is a relatively better Commercial Version of HTML Presentation Online Editor, but unfortunately not open source. So i can not count on this.

Sorry again, seems a lot of needs. If fact, I am currently a senior in one University and after a month, i will finish all my exams and i intend to try to implement all the needs above if i can not find on already implemented solution.

very very nice tool! I'm really impressed, and so looking forward to dump Apple Keynote at some point.. =)

Here's some bug I noticed: When using markdown, the ""content-container"" div in overview mode gets a bad height value, at least in Firefox. The more markdown text is added the higher the div becomes. Below is a screenshot and the json code to reproduce.

So I  installed 0.5.3 from the main github page using npm as suggested and then ran the local server. I exported my old presentations as JSON and then brought my basic starting template and starting adding slides. I added an image to a new slide then moved on but as soon as I went back to the previous slide the image was missing from the editor page. I can still the image in the thumbnail of the slide previews on the left and it is still visible when I run the presentation (click the impress button) but when I want to edit that slide with the image, there is no image, only the text boxes. If I refresh that page the image appears again and I can edit that slide but as soon as I move away from that slide all images vanish again. I thought this might be a problem as I use Chrome, but as soon as I opened the localhost:9000 from another browser I couldn't see any presentations form the open dialog (mild panic at that point :-) but when I went back to Chrome I could see the presentations. Does this mean that I can only use the browser that I created the presentation with first?

Also on the overview page in Chrome if I pick up a slide to move it I can't drop it, the only thing that works is to hold the control key down and select inspect element so the mouse moves out of the overview area and then refresh the page and go back to overview again.

Is there a browser that strut currently works properly in? Should I export and move to another browser

Many thanks,

Andy

I used Strut a little bit in the past and decided to use it now for another project. When I went to the website strut.io, the first thing I saw was the ""try it free"" graphic and my instant reaction was ""Oh crap, this software has become shareware/commercial and I have to look for an alternative"". 

It's the case in 99% of websites that if a graphic says ""try it for free"" then you only get a free trial and then have to start paying.

If your intention is not to start charging money for strut, please clarify that on the website! ""100% free open source"" is like a big nice welcome mat. ""Try it free"" is like saying ""grab your wallet and run away quickly"" to many people.

I'm assuming Strut is still intending to stay a free right?

First of all, thanks for writing Strut - it's awesome! :)

I use Strut for scientific presentations, and it is important for me to be able to run offline, as one cannot rely on internet access being available when visiting other research groups etc. Hence not being able to use local image files is a very strong limitation.

I tried a build from the latest version, because I thought this issue might have been solved https://github.com/tantaman/Strut/issues/235 .

And it does seem that images can be added now, without uploading to Imgur. However, although the pictures are visible in the slide editor, they do not show up in presentation mode. Also, when copy pasting an image which has previously been added, the original vanishes from the editor upon pasting of the copy.

**I have an actual fix to this memory limit crash!** It effectively detects mobile browsers, and hides all slides except for the current, next, and previous when viewed on a mobile device. Here's a link to a gist of the code snippet that's simply added to the &lt;head&gt; of the presentation's HTML: https://gist.github.com/KZeni/6735287

Code change highlights:
1. Updated jQuery to stable version (2.0.3) to avoid strange bugs with drag.
2. Replaces Sortable.js with jQuery UI + jquery.multidragable. Less code to maintain = profit.
3. Added a better way to create combined undo objects using record method of UndoHistory. This method accepts two parameters: callback and a name for the undo entry. Every undo item created during the callback execution will be combined into single command with a given name. It's much better than operating global undo flags (example: https://github.com/neochief/Strut/blob/cc876dcd02dd6dc8349753f02e6f2b20893ab517/app/bundles/app/strut.slide_components/view/ComponentView.js#L215)

I almost cracked my head trying to implement multiselect + multidrag for slide snapshots yesterday and today. I ended-up experimenting with jQuery UI Sortables, which give pretty nice results, allowing to remove a lot of custom code.

Other changes:
1. I've returned ability to Shift+click components. It should work just the same as Cmd/Ctrl+click.
2. Created css class for slide placeholder and assigned it the same styles as slide snapshot has (including margin, border and border-radius). This makes it more saxy and less annoying due to margin reset when you move slides around.
3. Fixed wrong behavior of Shift+click multiselect for slides, where old selection is not reset when you run new Shift+click. Now, you can do following stuff:

(given you have 10 slides and the 3rd is active)
1. Shift+click 5th slide (3-5 will be selected).
2. Shift+click 1st slide (1-3 will be selected, 4 and 5 not)
3. Ctrl+click 5th slide (1-3,5 will selected)
5. Shift+click 7th slide (3-7 will be selected, including 4th)

Note the 5th behavior. It's not how it works in file browser, where you'd have [1-3,5-7] selected. Implementing such system would take much more time and I don't think it's reasonable. Besides, even Keynote has it the way it's done in this pull request.

I was wondering about the changes to backbone.js from this commit https://github.com/tantaman/Strut/commit/cecbf726456600336831db4a94cd580a64361d1b

It looks like this hack could be avoided by using [changedAttributes()](http://backbonejs.org/#Model-changedAttributes) function of backbone here:
https://github.com/tantaman/Strut/commit/cecbf726456600336831db4a94cd580a64361d1b#L0L83

Also, it may have help to avoid overriding set() method here:
https://github.com/tantaman/Strut/blob/master/app/bundles/app/strut.deck/Deck.js#L43

... since you will be able to convert _activeSlideChanging() to a ""change"" event listener and use this.previous('activeSlide') to fetch previous slide:

https://github.com/tantaman/Strut/blob/master/app/bundles/app/strut.deck/Deck.js#L136

I'm not a big pro in backbone, so I might miss something. What do you think?

- A lot of refactoring (see commit description for details). I've inserted github comments into commits at some places to help you understand the changes, but diffs on github still look horrible; I had a better luck reviewing changes in my IDE. Really sorry for that.

Known issues:
- No multiselect in overview mode yet.
- No multidragging yet.
- No rectangular selection yet, just a Shift+click.
- Shift+click should be re-programmed to work as a range-selector instead of pick-selector. Cntrl/Cmd keys should work as pick selectors instead. But for now, I think it's okay.
- It looks like etch doesn't really fits multiselect scenario in terms of assigning text styles. Standard editor bar (global) would probably do a better job. Here's example: if you select two textboxes and want to change their font.

Problem:
- In 'Slides' mode, the little preview on the left doesn't show a correct preview. The content is shifted.
- In 'Overview' mode, the previews are also shifted.
- In 'Present' mode, the alignment of the slides is shifted from the 'Overview' mode.

Tested browsers:
- Firefox 23.0.1 on openSUSE 12.3 KDE 4.10.5
- Chromium 30.0.1553.0 (209444) on openSUSE 12.3 KDE 4.10.5
- Firefox 23.0.1 on Windows XP SP3

Reproduce:
- make two slides with text -> alignment bug in small previews on the left, see screenshot 1 and 2
- click on 'Overview' -> misalignment of content of slides, see screenshot 3
- make first slide larger (e.g. 8 instead of 3), see also screenshot 3
- align the slides (e.g. top is equal), again see screenshot 3
- click on 'Present' and the content is correct! But the alignment is not what to expect from the 'Overview', screenshot 4

I was wondering, is there some hidden ability to change width of a TextBox element?  I need it to replicate some of my Keynote presentations and there are lot of slides which look like this (look at text on the left):

Without width limiting, it's not possible to implement this with Strut right now.

If there's no way to change width right now, do you plan to include re-sizing control or is it something Strut will never have for textboxes (based on some discussions I've read in other issues)? In my opinion it's just a must-have feature.

I could help with implementing re-sizer if it's in road map. Otherwise I'll just create my own hacked textbox element for personal use.

Thanks!

- Scripts must be imported in app/scripts/main.js and attached to the window.startPres object for later execution
- The 3rd party presentation framework .js file must be modified to notify if pres has started and pass in document and window objects. i.e.

```
function startPres(document, window) {
if (window.presStarted)
    return;
window.presStarted = true;
```
- the startPreviewFn method for each *Generator.js must use innerHTML to populate the page from a prerendered handlebar template. 

```
previewWind.document.
getElementsByTagName(""html"")[0].innerHTML = previewStr;
```
- then you must manually initialize the scripts in the innerHTML or execute startPres.

To me this is a hack that can be avoided by using a sandboxed iframe. I quickly prototyped this concept using:

```
getStartPreviewFn: function(editorModel, sourceWind, previewStr) {
      function cb() {
var getFrame = function () {

            var frame = sourceWind.document.getElementById(""temp-frame"");
            if (!frame) {
              // create frame
              frame = sourceWind.document.createElement(""iframe"");
              frame.setAttribute(""id"", ""temp-frame"");
              frame.setAttribute(""name"", ""temp-frame"");
              frame.setAttribute(""seamless"", """");
              frame.setAttribute(""sandbox"", ""allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups allow-forms"");
              frame.setAttribute(""height"",""768px"")
              frame.setAttribute(""width"",""1024px"");
              frame.setAttribute(""allowFullScreen"","""");
              frame.style.position='absolute';
              frame.style.zIndex=1000;

            sourceWind.document.body.appendChild(frame);
            }
            // load a page
            return frame.contentDocument;
          };

          var frame = getFrame();
          frame.write(previewStr);
}
return cb;
}
```

Then in firefox or webkit, you could leverage the native requestFullScreen api to quickly toggle between preview and edit without having to switch tabs. For older/non-supporting browsers, a simple hide/show functionality of the iframe would suffice.

But the images only get added to the slide deck on the left hand side, and not on the main slides. Is this a bug, or am I doing it wrong? Thanks!

I have a presentation open right now. Is there a file on my file system that I can edit to insert a custom class to one of my slides? What would be the right way to do custom tweaks to a presentation that is being created with Strut?

The edge of the rotated text doesn't have a anti-aliasing feather.

So here is what I have seen in Chrome, the large rotated text looks so sharp.

Then I check the html code of the text and find this:

```
<div class=""componentContainer"" style=""top: 200px; left: 411px; -webkit-transform: rotate(-0.15rad)  ; -moz-transform: rotate(-0.15rad)  ; transform: rotate(-0.15rad)  ; width: px; height: px;"">
  <div class=""transformContainer"" style=""-webkit-transform: scale(1, 1);-moz-transform: scale(1, 1);transform: scale(1, 1)"">
  <div style=""font-family: ; font-size: 96px; font-weight: ; font-style: ; color: #; text-align: "">
    <font face=""Lato, sans-serif"">字体排印</font><br>
  </div>
</div>
```

  </div>

 `-webkit-transform: rotate(-0.15rad)` use a 2d transform which doesn't support an anti-aliasing. But if you use  `-webkit-transform: rotate(-0.15rad) translate3d( 0, 0, 0)` it turns out well.Because it enabled GPU hardware acceleration which will add some anti-aliasing as a bonus.

I want do share my ideas and suggestions about Strut. How to improve it. 
1. You should remove background:
   I think removing that square background would be much better. Because it's like rule to make your slides on square boxes. It would be much better to have space for creativity.
   Just leave some guidelines but no boxy background. Why?
   When you make your slides and you need to select background color and surface color. It make color on color.
   In my opinion this blends really ugly. Basically just leave surface to be able to put text and images right on surface.
2. You should put editing functions to the top bar:
   I think it's better because now when you editing you text those icons just moves back and forth. Sometimes it makes it harder to select your text for changing something.
   So I think it would look better at the top bar and of course ease of use factor.

Hope you understood my bad english. My goal was to brainstorm a bit and share my ideas to make Strut better. Also I hope you can respond and maybe we will have a nice conversation going on.

First of all, this is a great job you done! Love it! Thank you for your work!
Here I want to add a suggestion about the change slide order issue. 

I have 60 slides right now, but when I add a new slide (61) and drag it after slide 3 for example, the all slide presentation shifted. I don't want all slides shift their position, what we usually need is just add new slides, and keep the other slides position. That is really painful to adjust all 60 slides just because I want add one new slide at beginning.

Many thanks for your suggestions.

I'm having some trouble removing imported YouTube vids.  After importing a vid to the slide, it's difficult to remove it since the X is behind the video.  The x also only appears (sometimes) if you hover over the title of the vid (at the top).  When you hover over the x, it will sometimes disappear.

The only way I can get rid of the video consistently is to delete the slide.

Thanks for a great tool!  I'll be using it for a future presentation.  :)

- rotate  objects (for example text) 
- fade in / out objects
- change colour of text
- rotate slide

....without transitioning to the next slide.

 As it stands now it isn't possible to do this in any way except by copy & pasting to another slide and then moving to that slide, which in my opinion is making the audience have to move  around too much just because you wanted to highlite a piece of text or remove another on one and the same slide.

How this all works: Each slide has a local ""playlist"" of stuff that will happen whenever the user presses the transition button (space, mouse, whatever). So if there are commands on that list they will all be executed in order (and some at the same time, for example fading out two objects at the same time). When the playlist is at it's end then pressing the transition button will just take you to the next slide, as usual. Slides that have no local playlists will of course do nothing and work as they do just now.

(In impress (libre office) these are called custom animations or something, and while 90% of them are useless the few that aren't so are really usable. )

That is nice and all, but prohibits the smooth recycling of slides already shown and which you want to show again as a natural part of your presentation.

As it is now you show slide, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, in that order. If you want to then show slide 2 again after 5 you have to ""rewind"" and show all the steps inbetween OR you have to copy slide 2 and then add it as a fake ""slide 6"". The first solution is bad and confuses the audience and takes time. The second is bad because it adds too much (?) extra needless data and more importantly it makes it harder to get an overview of the slides and order in the editor since it adds more to it.

What I suggest is a simple ""playlist"" where you can specify slide number and slide order. So.... to solve the above example it would look someting like:  1.1, 2.2, 3.3, 4.4, 5.5, 6.2. When pressing space it will continue to 7.x and so on...

Because that’s what the scaling control is for. The problem is that the font size is relative to the bounding box, not absolute to the slide.

Similarly, sometimes there is an inadvertent line break, even when there are only 3 words. Seems like a glitch.

The bounding box should play no role for limiting the width of the text, breaks should need to be set manually. Also, scaling the box should change the font size accordingly (change it in the font size box to the value) – that way, it is possible to set custom font sizes. When you have a text box with custom font size, that extra font size should be displayed in the text size dropdown also. And a bit related: In the font size dropdown, the sizes used in this presentation should be highlighted a bit for reference.

Lots of ideas, what do you think?

2 thoughts:

1) absolute: have the slide order reflected in decreasing number label brightness (or similar), first slide is black, last one is white, all others are inbetween. Pseudocode for that:
    if(slides.length == 1) ordercolor = 0;
    else ordercolor = 255 / (slides.length - 1) \* slide.index
then style it with CSS rgb(ordercolor,ordercolor,ordercolor);
The minus 1 on slide length is because the first slide should always be black, there has to be an exception for that, otherwise division by 0.

2) relative: when having a slide selected, highlight the previous and next slides (and maybe even those 2 slides away, just a bit lighter).

- QR code should scan if it is framed by the rect of interest with a small margin

Found behavior:
- QR code does not scan unless it is significantly smaller than the rect of interest

Steps to reproduce:

- Modify example so that the preview is full screen. (To do this I deleted all constraints on it and used the autoresizing mask to cover all of the superview.)
- Modify the region of interest so that it appears approximately square even though the view is non-square
- Start scanning a QR code from up close, then zoom out
- It will be a while before the region detects the QR code - the QR code is only detected at scales much smaller than the region displayed (see image)

Also added border color change to indicate the issue with a red color.

As stated by Apple, the AVMetadataMachineReadableCodeObject.string can actually be nil and in that case, the previous code would crash.

I have not yet managed to figure out why the QRCode string could not be decoded. I have a particular QRCode from the Hermes Parcel Service with my own full address and that of another person, so I can naturally not attach that for debug purposes :-)
I suspect that either Hermes is doing something weird or there is a problem with the string encoding, which Apples framework does not handle correctly.

Also, there can be some apps which wants great QRCode reader as well as wants to design their own view. Therefore, I tried to hide the overlay view. I'm sorry for late pull request, but please look over this if possible.

1. Add “overlayView“ in QRCodeReaderDisplayable because now it can be hidden.
2. “overlayView” in QRCodeReaderView now becomes optional.
3. “setupComponents” method in QRCodeReaderView now set `isHidden` value of overlayView. Although it’s optional, it’s surely created but set hidden if required in the method.

First of all, thanks for great open source! =)

I'm considering using QRCodeReader.swift, but I thought it would be better if I have **options to hide rectangular guide view (`ReaderOverlayView` object) or zoom**. The option to hide rectangular guide view doesn't look so complicated though the structure seems to be changed. The options to support zooming feature is simpler, but IMO it should be checked why no apps support zooming feature. (I tried to add zooming feature, and it just works well. I thought about it, but don't have any idea about the reason not to support it so far.)

I tried to test about these, so I could make pull requests but I'd like to know your idea about these first. Thanks for reading my issue!

It takes a lot of time to read with 90% failure rate.I am using version 6.0 and i need very urgent help. Your help will be appreciated. Thanks

Currently `QRCodeReader` calls `stopScanning` when a QR code is found. `stopScanning` calls `stopRunning` on the `AVCaptureSession` which stops the video preview.

First, thanks for your nice work :)

In my app, I need to read different types of codes, and depending on the type of the scanned code, I need to substring the resulting string code. And, I might have missed something but I did not managed to get the type of the scanned code read (_readableCodeObject.type).

For people who need to read different types of codes, would it be possible to add the type of the code actually read ? 

The problem is : the output will not result in a String? anymore...

First of all – thanks so much for creating this. It's my personal _favorite_ of all the available UIProgressView subclasses out there right now. It goes **so** well with the project I'm currently working on.

Unfortunately, as [you would know](https://github.com/YannickL/YLProgressBar/issues/7), there seem to be some incompatibilities with iOS7. I have to admit that I didn't find out the exact reason why this was so. I basically needed a solution fast, to achieve iOS7 compatibility for this specific app.

Without digging too much into why this problem was occurring, it soon seemed to me that you were pretty much drawing the entire UIProgressView from scratch. So I thought I would just try subclassing it as a UIView instead and place the missing properties that it depended on.

It seems to have worked. Let me know what you think.

Thanks again!
Ahmed

The aforementioned phrase is ""It's not really possible to draw a triangle with just CSS styles without using an additional HTML element."". It is easy and totally fine to ""draw"" any shape by using the CSS ""content"" property of the before/after pseudo elements. This is why I believe that it is a little bit ""misleading"".

This technique serves what is mentioned in the answer ""Encourages separation of concerns because the triangle is considered part of styling and not really the DOM"".

A reference with a list of shapes can be found here: https://css-tricks.com/the-shapes-of-css/

Note: you do not have to add an empty html element and style it to draw a shape. You can just do that by using the pseudo elements.

Attention is given to cases where the method being called is actually inherited from a prototype object--in which case 'this' would reference the object left of the dot, not the object of which the function is a property. (see explanation below)


>3. If a function is called as a method, such as `obj.method()` — `this` is the object that the function is a property of.

This is often the case, but not always. Observe the code below:

```
const Animal = {
  catchPhrase: ""I'm on the Animal object!"",
  testMethod: function() {
    console.log(this.catchPhrase);
  }
}; // set up a basic Animal object with a catchPhrase property and a testMethod method referencing the keyword 'this'.

const Kitty = Object.create(Animal); // create an empty object which is a subclass of Animal--i.e., Animal is Kitty's prototype.

Kitty.catchPhrase = ""I'm on the Kitty object!""; // give Kitty its own catchPhrase property to differentiate it from Animal. catchPhrase is now the sole property on the Kitty object.

Kitty.testMethod(); // ""I'm on the Kitty object!""
// testMethod is not found on Kitty, so the lookup falls back to the prototype, Animal. According to the existing explanation, when testMethod() references 'this', Animal should be the object referenced, as Animal is the object that testMethod is found on. However, that's not the case. 'this' refers instead to Kitty, the object left of the dot when the function is called--even though the function doesn't even exist on that object.

`Object.create(Person.prototype)` actually won't quite work the same as it won't properly set up the `this.name`. I think this is pretty subtle but worth showing an explicit example.

Alternatively, we could just remove the reference to using `Object.create` at all since it's not really part of the original question. However, I liked the fact that you mentioned it as a sort of extra credit thing :) 

Also, I elected to block quote the MDN docs on exactly what happens when you use `new F`.

Also, you probably meant if we used it like:

```js
var joe = Object.create(Person.prototype);
joe.name = 'Joe';
console.log(joe.name);
```

This is nuanced and perhaps debatable too haha. I happened to be reading an example polyfill in the MDN [docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/assign#Polyfill) on `Object.assign` and they do:

`if (target == null) { // TypeError if undefined or null`

If I'm understanding your https://github.com/yangshun/front-end-interview-handbook/blob/master/questions/javascript-questions.md#whats-the-difference-between-a-variable-that-is-null-undefined-or-undeclared-how-would-you-go-about-checking-for-any-of-these-states section

you're advising that you should not take advantage of the fact that

```javascript
null === undefined
false
null == undefined
true
```

I usually would agree, but would you say they're example is a misuse of loose checking? I could see it written as:

`if (target === null || target === undefined) {`

So my issue here is probably not more of an issue then discussion (so feel free to close). But, I think it's interesting :)

The examples for an answer is incorrect:
https://github.com/yangshun/front-end-interview-handbook/blob/master/questions/javascript-questions.md#explain-hoisting

Believe it or not, variables declared using `let` or `const` are hoisted, their namespace gets hoisted however they do not get declared until the interpreter reaches the line of code on which the declaration happens. To demonstrate this:

```javascript
var a = ""foo"";
function proofOfHoisting(){
  console.log(a);
  let a = ""bar"";
}
```

If hoisting was to not be a thing for `let` and/or `const` then running this function would actually log `foo`, however it does not, it gives a reference error because the inner variable is hoisted, but not declared, however because of hoisting the outer variable is not visible.",NA,FALSE,https://api.github.com/repos/yangshun/front-end-interview-handbook,https://api.github.com/repos/yangshun/front-end-interview-handbook/issues/168/labels{/name},https://api.github.com/repos/yangshun/front-end-interview-handbook/issues/168/comments,https://api.github.com/repos/yangshun/front-end-interview-handbook/issues/168/events,https://github.com/yangshun/front-end-interview-handbook/issues/168,NA

I meant to write that the advantage of the *`for`* loop is that you can break from it. 

BEFORE

The advantage of the _**`for-of`**_ loop is that you can break from it, and the advantage of forEach() is that it is more concise than the for loop because you don't need a counter variable. With the for-of loop, you get both the ability to break from a loop and a more concise syntax.

Just a quick clarification about this answer:

Changes to position absolute will not cause reflow (recalculation of layout) and the reason being they are already separated from normal flow. 
They do trigger repaint (and composite).

To extend the original answer:
- Translate also avoids pixel snapping (https://www.paulirish.com/2012/why-moving-elements-with-translate-is-better-than-posabs-topleft/)

Explain the process the browser uses when evaluating the content of this attribute.

The `srcset` attribute allows the browser the ability to choose the appropriate image for a given rendering situation. For example: `srcset=""small.jpg 500w, medium.jpg 1000w, large.jpg 200w""` tells the browser to display the small, medium or large .jpg graphic depending on the client's resolution. The way the browser calculates which graphic to use is quite interesting:

500 / 320 = 1.5625
1000 / 320 = 3.125
2000 / 320 = 6.25

If the client's resolution is Retina x1, the calculation closer to 1 will be selected by the browser.

If the resolution is Retina x2, the browser will use the closest resolution above the minimum. Meaning it will not choose the 1.5 resolution becasue it is greater than 1. The browser would then choose the image closer to 2 which is 3.1.

So, `srcset` makes the browser a bit smarter by ignoring smaller graphics and using the most appropriate img based on math.

First of all, great job with this repo. I found the information here extremely useful (even if it's not for an interview prep).

I was reading about the difference between constructors and factories in JS and found this blog post to be quite useful: https://medium.com/javascript-scene/javascript-factory-functions-vs-constructor-functions-vs-classes-2f22ceddf33e.

My attempt at answering the question (based on that text and its references) would be:

From a practical point of view, the main difference are how to instantiate new objects and what `this` refers to when creating them.

Classes are a syntax sugar for Constructor functions, which basically define a new object and append functions to its prototype. This allows developers to instantiate objects using `new` and also ensure that `this` inside the class refers to the object being created (similar to other languages).

```javascript
class ClassCar {
  drive () {
    console.log('Vroom!');
  }
}

const car1 = new ClassCar();
console.log(car1.drive());
```

Factories are functions that return the new object, which gives developers a bit more freedom on how the object will be instantiated (if more than just creating the object is needed, like pooling). Since factories are just regular functions `this` won't refer to the object being created.

```javascript
const proto = {
  drive () {
    console.log('Vroom!');
  }
};

function factoryCar () {
  return Object.create(proto);
}

const car3 = factoryCar();
console.log(car3.drive());
```

There are more differences, specially regarding the code design of the application which are explored deeper at [Eric Elliot's post](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/javascript-factory-functions-vs-constructor-functions-vs-classes-2f22ceddf33e), if you want to know more about the implications of using Classes or Factories, I recommend checking it out.

Can you tell me why you set the threshold as 0.6 and the percentage threshold as 70?
I knew the ""threshold"" in FaceNet which is used to distinguish faces are from the same person or not, but it seems that the ""threshold"" in your program is different.
Can you tell me why you set two different thresholds?

And one more question.
I saw the equation in your source code main.py :
percentage =  min(100, 100 * thres / smallest)
I downloaded your source code and it worked well for me.
I wonder why the real-time face recognition can work well by using this equation.
Is there something like principle to explain it? 
Looking forward to your reply. :)

> There's an inherent risk to using an image in the QR Code. Specifically the risk is that it takes away too much of the actual scannable portion. By excavating (as seems to be the difference in your demos) you're actually taking away even more modules, not just the ones that are getting covered by the image. I don't have any protections in there to prevent embedding an image that covers up more than the error correction level can handle (the math got messy, transparent images change the math) so if you find yourself with a QR Code that doesn't scan, you need to correct that yourself. You have 2 options:
> 
> 1. Change the ratio of QR Code to image size. Make the image smaller or the QR Code bigger.
> 2. Increase the Error level (`level`), which will result in smaller modules with a better ability to handle covered areas.

Actually, my current workaround to add custom classes into the QRCode component is using a wrapper `div`, something like: 
```js
// React code
<div className=""qr-code-custom-class"">
    <QRCode {...props} />
</div>
```
So, I think we could add as QRCode prop the `className` attribute in order to be possible add custom classNames into the QRCode canvas.
