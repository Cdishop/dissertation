Ok great you found it.
As for 256/257 I see binary 01 00 that represents 01 X 256 + 0 x1 == 256 
as the editor really gives 257 as track (see screenshot) I expect an 2nd complementary notation or so.
But anyway great I think byte=>short should be the fix.
Great work really!!.

The result parser result (the metadata) can then be be very easily transferred to the browser via JSON.

In the browser there is no such thing as direct file access. Never the less, if parsing on the browser side is what you need, [music-metadata-browser](https://github.com/Borewit/music-metadata-browser) is solely designed for browser usage (sorry for the predictable correction). Modules are initially a Node.js concept, and you need a _module bundler_ like WebPack to convert this to a script which can be executed to the browser.

There are ""pre-build"" scripts, which are sometimes shipped via modules, like [jsmediatags.min.js](https://github.com/aadsm/jsmediatags/blob/master/dist/jsmediatags.min.js). Maybe that is what you mean with _browser only_. No need module bundler, you can directly import. Very simple.

Why use are ""browser"" modules & _module bundlers_ used? Because it allows modularization, of the code, which becomes important if the complexity of the code grows with the number of dependencies. Mostly at the point where you want to share dependencies, because that does not fly with pre-build code. Dependencies are for example duplicated in each imported distribution.

I did some digging, here's the situation as I understand it.

First of all, I should have specified that this happens when bundling with webpack. React-native-fs is listed as ""optionalPeerDependencies"" in jsmediatags' package.json, which means it is not installed when doing ""npm install jsmediatags"", which is great, cause I don't really want it in my project. Webpack is pretty aggressive tho, and it doesn't matter that the dependencies are behind an if statement. Webpack will try to add react-native-fs to my bundle. The error message found in the first post is Webpack not finding the optional dependencies because they are not installed.

So, to be more precise, the actual issue is this:
Webpack (with default configuration) will fail to package jsmediatags because of optional react dependencies. And even installing the optional dependencies manually seems not to work properly.

The best solution I found was to exclude react-native-fs from my bundle with some webpack [externals](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/externals) configuration.

`module.exports = {
  externals: {
    'react-native-fs': 'reactNativeFs',
  }
}`

There is a browser-specific build that doesn't include the React Native dependency. And there is this line in package.json that should tell webpack to use that build:

```json

But the problem seems to be that this file is missing on npm for whatever reason.

```js
conts jsm = require('jsmediatags')

var filepath = '/path/to/audio.mp3'

new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    new jsm.Reader(filepath).setTagsToRead([

        onSuccess: (tag) => {
            resolve({

                track_path: filepath

I was not expecting this, this library only reads the `moov.udta.meta` atom where all the metadata resides.

I search a bit online and found that it is the Quicktime Chapters format that is stored in a very similar fashion to subtitles: https://github.com/Zeugma440/atldotnet/wiki/Focus-on-Chapter-metadata#quicktime-qt-chapters
The Nero Chapters, which is another format, are actually stored in `moov.udta` and includes the starting time of the chapter. 
The QT do not and forces you to read the samples in a non-trivial way to get to the name of each chapter.

The way MP4 support is implemented is extermly naive right now, we just go down the tree of atoms and find the first one that matches the metadata. I’m surprised it has been working since this only works if the metadata happens to be the first one in the tree as we don’t backtrack.

To implement this we need:
* Rewrite MP4 atom reading to be able to read any atom in the tree
* Implement the logic to read and parse the chapters.

I'd say the two main gotchas to add webworker support is:
* This library has synchronous methods, the configuration basically. Webworkers operate exclusively in asynchronous mode.
* Some config options expect to receive modules directly (which you won't be able to pass to a webworker).

I think the best method is for you to put the code you have that uses jsmediatags in a webworker (I'm expecting this lib to work out of the box in a webworker, if it doesn't feel free to add details here). You then need to provide a way for to get the data out of the webworker. Here's an idea how to do that:

Put your code that uses jsmediatags into its own file (e.g.: `tagReader.js`). Here's an example for the read method:
```javascript
var jsmediatags = require(""jsmediatags"");
self.onmessage = function(message) {
  read(message.data);
};
function read(location) {
  jsmediatags.read(location, {
    onSuccess: function(tag) {
      self.postMessage({location: location, type: 'success', data: tag});
    },
    onError: function(error) {
      self.postMessage({location: location, type: 'error', error: error});
    }
  });
}
```

Then use the file in a webworker like:
```javascript
var tagReaderWorker = new Worker('tagReader.js');
tagReaderWorker.onmessage = function(message) {
  if (message.data.type === 'success') {
    console.log(message.data.location, message.data.data);
  } else {
    console.log('error', message.data.error);
  }
};
tagReaderWorker.postMessage(""http://www.example.com/music-file.mp3"");

The problem is that some FLAC tags are not TITLE, but Title or title instead. 

jsmediatags is running a switch case on these with only ALL CAPS, so it's missing the FLACs that have them with all lowercase or first-letter-capitalized and the rest lower.  I just edited it to add the necessary checks (pull requests have gone unanswered here for awhile so I'm not going to bother.) 

jsmediatags/src/FLACTagReader.js - find the _parseData function and replace the case statements there with this:

switch (split[0]) {
        case ""TITLE"":
        case ""Title"":
        case ""title"":  
          title = split[1];
          break;
        case ""ARTIST"":
        case ""Artist"":
        case ""artist"":
          artist = split[1];
          break;
        case ""ALBUM"":
        case ""Album"":
        case ""album"":
          album = split[1];
          break;
        case ""TRACKNUMBER"":
        case ""Tracknumber"":
        case ""tracknumber"":
          track = split[1];
          break;
        case ""GENRE"":
        case ""Genre"":
        case ""genre"":
          genre = split[1];
          break;
      }

You can see its merely appending two additional case lines for the Title and title options (and so on down the line)

Tested working with one of my FLACs that caused me to look into this.

Most of you probably just want this to work and are not looking to fork and compile, in which case just go to the dist directory, copy out the jsmediatags.js file (not the minified one) and make the edits there, its fairly near the top. Save and there you go or run it through your own online minifier of choice if you need/want a min version. Adventurous individuals can look at one of the lingering pull requests here for adding missing tag fields to FLACs - since you are already editing the file you may wish to insert those changes in as well - equally as easy as this edit.

And thanks to @aadsm hope things are well for you. The music-metadata-browser option someone posted above is much more expansive, but also comes with a lot more dependencies and a different use-flow. This js is pleasantly lean and fits my use case quite well.

I figured out how to ignore specific modules for the `react-native` bundler by adding the following to package.json:

```json
{
  ...
  ""dependencies"": {
    ...
  },
  ""react-native"": {
    ""fs"": false
  },
  ...
}
```

Completely undocumented, but found out that functionality on SO.

Also apparently checking that the global `navigator` is set, and checking that `navigator.product === ""ReactNative""` is the way to check for `react-native` at runtime.

So the issues I've listed above should be non-issues and this should (hopefully) not break a browser or `nodejs` build.

This work around is probably fine for me for now. In the future, I might want to let users supply a URL, and I’d rather not have to handle all the possible types of URLs that lack protocols: relative URLs, absolute URLs, protocol relative URLs (I think that’s all?)

Since I know that the input is a url in this case, it would be a bit better to be able to tell that to jsmediatags directly, rather than having to change the input so that it can infer the type.

Again, it’s possible to work around this, so I’m not blocked, but it does add a bit of cruft on my end.

Thanks again for the great library.

1. React-Native is built with node/babel, so the build2 directory needs to ignore the `NodeFileReader` or the build error will still exist. This differs from the browserify solution ignoring the `NodeFileReader` since the build pipeline is different.
2. Conditional `require`s aren't supported by `react-native` so I'm not sure how to deal with conditional builds for the node vs React-Native versions.
3. `react-native-fs` is promise-based. Support for promises with this library would be nice. Translating between callbacks/promises works but is a bit awkward.
4. Not sure what encoding should be used--music files are binary and `react-native-fs` recommends `base64` for binary, but I'm not sure if the tags are treated differently or what this library expects.

It inserts the string ""MP3ext V3.3.19(ansi)"" multiple times after the last frame breaking the read logic.

This is being run on the browser in the end, not in node, that's why `fs` module doesn't exist as it's a node module.
The npm module I publish does contain the browser version (added for bower support) but you need to import it explicitly: `import jsmediatags from 'jsmediatags/dist/jsmediatags';`.
However, it still doesn't work for various reasons:
1) jsmediatags checks the global `process` variable to figure out if it's running under node and for some reason in this environment this variable exists! So wrong assumptions are being made in the core logic.
2) Your path to the mp3 file is a local path - `""./Sleep Away.mp3""` - but since this is being run in the browser it should be an `http://` path.

I don't know much about webpack because I've never used it so no idea what all of these findings mean in this context, but I can tweak the `process` check to be more robust for this situation.

Another thought is: since webpack tries to run node modules on the browser maybe there's a way to polyfil the `fs` module for the browser? Then you wouldn't need to worry with all this and it would just work (from a quick google search it doesn't look like it though).",NA,https://api.github.com/repos/aadsm/jsmediatags/issues/57/comments,https://github.com/aadsm/jsmediatags/issues/57#issuecomment-313123227,https://api.github.com/repos/aadsm/jsmediatags/issues/57

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29096018/react-webpack-process-env-is-undefined

It seems that process is defined when `target: 'web'` is set in webpack. This is also the default setting.
I can't change this because other code depends on process.

A couple of things:

1. Could you please change this when you have time. It's not a critical issue because I can work around it by providing a valid file url all the time.

2. http files don't seem to work either. Could you give an example please? I tried `http://www.jplayer.org/audio/mp3/Miaow-01-Tempered-song.mp3` and it just gives a generic error. It definitely has metadata in the song.

3. Blob preview files aren't supported by that regex. I want to get the metadata from blob preview .mp3 files such as: `blob:http://localhost:8070/1dd7e4bc-a8d8-4fd9-bbee-672399aa747c`. Could this be supported? The reason I need this supporting is because I want to get the metadata tags instantly before uploading the files so I can populate a form for the user automatically.

My only comment about the approach is related to the creation of a mutual dependency between `ID3TagReader` and `ID3FrameReader`.

My recommendation is to move the `_readFrames` function to `ID3FrameReader` (with all its frame reading dependencies like `_readFrameHeader` (but not `_expandShortcutTags` though)) so they can be reused there without having to create a new data reader and ID3TagReader.

It is not supported indeed. To be honest, I was not familiar with MusicBrainz until you brought this issue up.
From a quick read up on their site it looks like they have a music database similar to IMDB but for music.
With reading MusicBrainz tags do you mean these tags that I found on this page? https://picard.musicbrainz.org/docs/mappings/ They mention that they map some of the tags to ID3 TXXX type of tags.

Can you give me an example of a file that you want to read these tags from?

This new jsmediatags api only has three mediaFileReaders: http-get, blob and FileReader. FileReader gives access to the html file tag. But with this the src can not be set by code for security reasons. That is why Cordova offers its File class which needs the Android WriteToFile access permission.
The previous JavaScript-ID3-Reader api was able to make use of the cordova File class and there are many examples out there like https://dzone.com/articles/working-mp3s-id3-and
Unfortunately, this api does not retrieve the copyright tags :-( At least not for the ccMixter mp3 files like http://ccmixter.org/content/SiobhanD/SiobhanD_-_The_Quiet_Hours.mp3

If it works well for JavaScript-ID3-Reader then it should also work with this one as jsmediatags supports everything the previous library did and more.

```
jsmediatags.read(""http://....SiobhanD_-_The_Quiet_Hours.mp3"", {

@egoroof Thanks for pointing that out. I'll see if that fits what I need it to do. From a quick glance it seems like the annoyance of using two libraries for reading and writing would be making sure that both support all the ID3 tag types and have a somewhat similar API. My use case is that I need to add a single tag to a file that already has metadata attached and I want to leave the other metadata untouched (browser-id3-writer says it overwrites existing tags). So, using these two libraries together would right now mean (first adding some more tag types to broser-id3-writer -- I'm using the WPAY one, which isn't supported) reading the tags with jsmediatags, translating the formats, and then writing with browser-id3-writer. At the moment I'm calling out to an external command line tool for writing tags (which also parses them so it's possible to add one without replacing the others).

The reason I didn't find any metadata in the stream is because a `Icy-MetaData: 1` request header is needed for the server to send it.
The metadata is sent on every `x` number of bytes streamed. I haven't tried but it should be possible to read this using the `progress` event that XHR emits now. The biggest issue on the browser would be using CORS, but should be possible in a node environment.
I'll look into it.

Love the library btw, much faster than others that I have tried, and also fixed an issue I had with old latin characters encoding I was struggling . 
In my opinion this is a concurrence issue. And a sync method would avoid the issue although it wouldn't work as fast as it works today. 
Why I say it's a concurrence issue it's because in my program I'm running an script that loop through ""My Music"" folder and gets ID3 info on each mp3 found. 
At first I looked that always crashed on the same mp3 file. So I looked the ID3 details on that file and also on the previous loaded mp3 and saw something interesting. The previous mp3 had a big image as part of its details. So, come up the theory that maybe  when the library was reading the id3 info of the mp3 that crashed, still was loading the heavy image of the previous mp3, causing a concurrence issue.
So part of the testing I did, was to first make a print of the id3 whole structure for each file. So this way the process takes a little bit longer before going to the next mp3 on the loop. 
The error continued, although now not in the same file. It started to crash in different places on the loop. 
So finally I've took out mp3 picture as part of the info only including the tags that I needed
 `new jsmediatags.Reader(mp3FilePath)
                  .setTagsToRead([""title"", ""album"", ""track""])
                  .read({
            onSuccess: function(tags) {
...
`
And from there worked fine.  So the theory is that if a tag is too big this one takes more than usual to load. So if meanwhile it's loading this file, an asynchronous call is made over the same object then you get this concurrence exception. 
I know is not a solution, just a theory, it's what I have and hope it helps someone.

being that the reading is in an async method, am I correct to think that there is no way to catch and handle an exception coming from it? And if I am correct, wouldn't it be better to fall back to the onError callback in such a case?

I was originally planning to use promises, which solves this issue. However, support in the browser was lacking at the time and I didn't want to include a huge library. This wasn't an issue in the past so it wouldn't bring much value.
Today most browsers implement it and there are <500b Promises/A+ implementations so I want to rethink this approach.

@venomlust I don't think the use of promises would solve your problem though. This introduces a change from `jsmediatags.read(url, {onSuccess: handleTags})` to `jsmediatags.read(url).then(handleTags)`.
However, with the introduction of generators in ES6, or even better, the `async/await` operators in ES7 you can code with promises in a sync way: `tags = await jsmediatags.read(url);`.

I hope this clarifies my position on this topic.

``` javascript
jsmediatags.Config.setDisallowedXhrHeaders(['If-Modified-Since', 'Range']);
```

In this particular case it still doesn't work because the request never finishes, maybe crossorigin.me doesn't allow requests greater than 2MB? I'm not sure about the reason but it doesn't timeout so it keeps waiting for more data from the server.
To solve this I added a way to configure the request timeout and default it to 30s.

You're not able to try/catch these XHR errors, you can know about them with the `onerror` event.

It also supports const actually, I thought you had an older version of node that didn't support it, but all v4 do, so that was not the issue.

I've googled about this and it seems that meteor doesn't use the node version that is installed in your system, it uses its own, and it's not v4.0.
There is a specific thread on meteor github issues regarding this issue: https://github.com/meteor/meteor/issues/5124.

I would like to avoid compiling everything down to ES5 for performance reasons. Here's what you can do in the meanwhile, at least for development (I don't know how you push to production).
- Clone the repo with `git clone https://github.com/aadsm/jsmediatags.git` and `npm link` in that directory.
- Update the contents of `.babelrc` with https://gist.github.com/aadsm/cd2c5aff9929bdc95b55.
- Run `npm install`.
- Run `npm run build`.
- Go to your own project and run `npm link jsmediatags`, this will make node use the one linked in the first step instead of the one published in npm.

I'm just a general user rather than official maintainer. So I just share some of my ideas here.

[GB 2312](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=GB_2312)⊊[GBK](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=GBK_(character_encoding))⊊[GB 18030](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=GB_18030)

(By the way, the standard GB 2312-1980 had been renamed to GB/T 2312-1980 in [2017](http://std.sacinfo.org.cn/gnoc/queryInfo?id=4EBEA47E8BD1B921FC1E99294F4B8C29).)

For standard documents they are:
GB/T 2312-1980 ⊊ GBK 1.0 ⊊ GB 18030-2000 ⊊ GB 18030-2005

The latest effective standard is GB 18030-2005. All of the rest were replaced.

Maybe it is hard to identify if a file is encoded in GB 18030 (unless it has unique characters of GB 18030).

For example, if I create a file in GB 18030 and input some characters from [CJK Unified Ideographs Extension B](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=CJK_Unified_Ideographs_Extension_B), which has been included in GB 18030-2005, it cannot be decoded correctly by encode guess.

The context this problem came up in was attempting to convert IRC messages from various encodings into UTF-8, so they can be bridged to Discord.

Example strings:

- `eu não gosto de diferenciação` (in the windows-1252 encoding), erroneously detected as `windows-1251` and accordingly interpreted as `eu nгo gosto de diferenciaзгo` (notice ""não"" → ""nгo"" and ""ção"" → ""згo"")
- `informações` (in the windows-1252 encoding), erroneously detected as `windows-1251` and accordingly interpreted as `informaушes`
- `ça me fait rire` (in the windows-1252 encoding), *correctly* detected as `windows-1252`

Since this is likely to be due to conflicting possible encodings, it might be hard to come up with code that distinguishes these situations? The sample languages above are Portuguese and French.

I'm not the author of this library, but I'm afraid this wouldn't be possible. jschardet is a port of python's chardet (https://github.com/chardet/chardet), which is licensed under LGPL and is also based on the work of another developer who has started developing the library in 2006 (or before) and already licensed the code under LGPL. From my point of view, every author of the three libraries has to acknowledge to change the license...

But is it really necessary to change the license to fulfill your corporate requirements? I have evaluated the license before I used jschardet in a project and if I understand it right, all you have to do is deliver the source code of jschardet with the license text to your clients, so that they could modify the library.

It's a big difference from GPL (which usually most companies do not want to use). However, I understand that you don't make the policy so it might be an overzealous policy in place that you can't do anything about.

I looked into it and these are the higher confidence levels I get when processing that file:

windows-1250 confidence = 0.8075649621709267
windows-1252 confidence 0.9498656452563347

The problem is that the latin1 prober (the windows-1252) is winning, they have really similar encoding tables actually and since there are many more latin1 in the text (compared to the more distinct ă Ă â Â î Î ş Ş ţ Ţ chars)  that's probably the reason the confidence is higher and it wins in the end...
The confidence for the latin1 is already artificially lowered because of this exact reason but maybe it's not enough for some situations... (https://github.com/aadsm/jschardet/blob/master/src/latin1prober.js#L151-L155)

Charset encoding detection is purely based on heuristics, these encodings have a statistical model based on frequency so it's never going to be 100% accurate.

I wonder how OpenSubtitles do it, maybe the browser sends that information when posting the file?

Yes, you are correct.

Nope, that info is not sent to the browser as the subtitle files are never encoded correctly.

It is not deterministic at all, it's a best effort, hence the confidence property.

Since UTF-8 is a superset of the ASCII, any ASCII text, by definition, is also a valid UTF-8 text. In these cases it is not possible to detect how the text was originally created unless a BOM is specified.

This is not a problem at all since readers will be able to correctly decode the text when given a charset of ""ascii"".

Some detection is immediate, like when there's a BOM in UTF. Others are not deterministic so they use a state machine based on a statistical model so it should be a matter of feeding more data into the SM.

These are the Prober's, they have a `feed()` function that you can use to give more data to the SM and a `reset()` function to clean it up and start over.

To have something automatic maybe create a `feedStream()` function (this will share a lot of stuff with `feed()` so it's probably better to refactor it into reusable functions) that gets a stream and feeds chunks of it into the probers until a satisfying result is achieved (maybe also passing a `maximumDataLength` to use in case the minimum confidence level is never achieved).

Hope it helps.

Yeah, that's probably the best solution instead of just transforming it into a string. Everything is string based because the project was originally written to be used in the browser.

We could create an object (say BinaryData) to represent the data and that has the same methods I'm using on the String object, from what I've seen they are:
- `[]` // Buffer and String
  - need to hack a bit the BinaryData to make this work, but doable. on the other hand we're probably able to get rid of it but it means more work and having to change the code here and there.
- `==` // String
  - a `compareWith` method should be able to replace `==`
- `charCodeAt` // String
  - easy to implement with Buffer
- `replace` // String
  - Buffers don't really accept a regexp so something would need to change here, maybe a function that is range based or that receives a function that will be used to match (more generic but probably a bit slower, specially for the String case)
- `slice` // Buffer and String
- `test` // String

Git uses SHA1 but it's less vulnerable because it's prefixed with the file length which adds a constraint, the hashes are on a per file basis, and people are always looking at the text diffs, so you'd have to hide the change in a binary. Yet people are moving forward with plans to deprecate SHA1 in git. A node package is just a tarball though, and completely opaque to end users. You could use any file, or even insert a hidden file, and since the file size isn't part of the hash you have a lot of freedom.

- filesystem emulation at the OS level (i.e. FUSE)

- require manipulation at the node level (hijack the 'require' module)

There are various pros and cons that I haven't mentally sorted out yet. Some of them are install time manipulations (hard linking) while others require a runtime modification (hijacking the 'require' module). I'm leaning toward trying hijacking the 'require' module myself, but I simply have not had time.

Fwiw, I've been made aware I'm not that good at paraphrasing things for easy consumption on this type of forum. My apologies in advance if any of this seems overly ""wordy"".

### In Summary (TL;DR;)
 - Was reusing yarn.lock's format considered?
 - Potential issues, between two machines, caused be versions of dependencies used, when running the install lifecycle, while installing modules to machine level stores.

### Reinventing the wheel?
I was wondering if simply using yarn's lock format had been considered? I cursorily looked at both specs and on the surface it appears they're both intending to solve the same fundamental problem in the same fundamental way, by atomically storing: a flat version dependency graph using content hashes as version identifiers; the dependency version-set specifiers used when obtaining the content and their mapping's to the semantic version and hash version; and the content's source registry? Please correct me if I'm in error. 

The pro of this, and the impetus for the question, is it would ease developer workflows where the graph has previously been computed and stored with the source in a SCCS, for both `yarn` and `pnpm/ied` users. 

The con is that `pnpm/ied` is then coupled to what `yarn` is doing. For example, I was dismayed that they chose a proprietary serialization encoding rather than yaml or even json; it may have been related to trying to keep the file human-readable, but still machine parse-able and small; they get quite large and I wouldn't be surprised if the proposed lock files here wouldn't be similarly sized. However this to me seems like another opportunity for collaboration, and it's hard to imagine a great deal of backwards breaking ""innovation"" occurring to the file structure and encoding given its purpose. 

I do see the value of being able to simply open one in an editor and find what I'm looking for, and it would be nice to that end if it used some common encoding, but part of me would prefer doing that through the command line tool (as the files are usually large), where I could just type something like (btw what would the merged effort's tool be named?) `pnpmied list somemod` and it would nicely format outputting all the version info for it, maybe along with just a double check that's actually what's installed, along with the timestamp of when it was locked (which I think would be an enhancement to whats currently captured and stored), and it would both fuzzy match if no exact name found, and allow for regex's in specifying the name; I'd love that! Just a thought.

### Timing of computing hash version of globally installed modules
A question I have, not directly related to the lock format itself, is exactly when the version hash of a module installed at the machine level is computed. I believe certain activities that can occur while running install lifecycle steps rely on other modules, and are therefore potentially deterministic in behavior and output by the versions of the modules being depended upon during installation, and today those dependency versions can change from local install to local install. I also wonder if certain installs alter their output as a function of what's depending on them (a bad thing to be doing in my opinion). I honestly have no direct measure of how frequently altered output as a consequence of either of those actually occurs in practice, or if at all, I just know it's technically possible, and if the desire is to ""nail it"" with respect to version locking to ensure determinism, it might need to be considered.

To me, this is just one of those 'sucky' problems that might happen once in a blue moon, and if it did would 'break' things in a very subtle, hard to initially locate kind of way, and requires a fair amount of effort to completely deal with. For example, in this case, to mitigate problems as a consequence of output coupled to versions of dependencies used during installation, we'd want to then store for potential re-use on other machines, and include as part of the hash input, what hashed dependencies where used for installation, and then integrate all of that when rendering the physical tree; i.e. if the module hash in the lock file didn't exist, we'd have to install at the machine level, using the dependency versions originally used to generate that hash, and NOT those from the lock file been rendered.

For the other issue, output coupled to the dependent of what's being installed?... uhm.... punt to documentation that it's not supported, and discourage making modules behave that way, possible with a recommended alternate pattern to address how to achieve the same ends; although I'd wait to do any of that until it's actually encountered and can be analyzed.

But I'm not sure it's right for this use case. I assume the point is to standardize installer output so that debugging failed installs is easier. In my CI build steps I used to run `npm install`with the verbosity level at 'silly', so I can try to figure out whether the install failed due to a network timeout, a package being unavailable (404), my npm cache server (50x), a package's node-gyp build step failing, or the OOM killer. However, the npm output would be enormous and be unmanageable, particularly in a CI web interface showing console output. I eventually wrote my own installer that reads package.json and executed 'npm install' for each dependency separately. This greatly reduced npm's memory usage, AND allowed me to handle errors individually. Instead of bailing at the first failed install, it would keep going, and at the end present a report listing which packages failed to install, so I could decide whether I actually needed to rebuild the image (I may not be testing the part of the app that requires those modules), instantly informed me whether the problem was with the new dependencies I just added, a problem with npmjs itself (symptom: 3-10 packages at random out of 100 failed), or with my build environment (node-gyp failed to compile X, or installing a dependency from Github failed because the git+ssh port was blocked).",NA,https://api.github.com/repos/alexanderGugel/ied/issues/190/comments,https://github.com/alexanderGugel/ied/issues/190#issuecomment-266294431,https://api.github.com/repos/alexanderGugel/ied/issues/190

Sounds ambitious, but I'm not against trying, if only because it will make us carefully consider what type of events our programs could expose. Another possibility, I just want to bring up, would be to ditch the limitations of communicating through stdout and use an EventEmitter. If we choose to write our core installers (e.g. modinst) as a separate package from our cli programs (e.g. modinst-cli), then it would be easy for others to write not just reporters, but also input handling. For instance, right now there are big differences in the command names used by npm (npm install) and yarn (yarn add). I think the yarn names are attempting to improve upon the npm command names, but in doing so they've created friction. Converting old scripts that use ""npm install -S"" to use yarn would take effort. Instead, we could have one CLI interface, and allow specifying the underlying backend to use! So for example,

```
nodeinstall express --save --use=pnpm
nodeinstall express --save --use=ied --ied-specific-option

It's still vital, but the issue phestermcs outlines is one I've been trying to work out. I think that's why I was wondering about some modules being ""top level"" installed modules. My assumption was that each top level package has its own (locked) dependency tree and the store lockfile would basically be a superset of those lockfiles.

The lockfiles could accurately describe the desired dependency tree. Whether that dependency tree was realizable in a directory structure _ with no duplication of modules _ was a problem I'd set aside for now, having come to the conclusion that new require semantics were necessary.

If you guys are writing a new package manager & thinking about a common store directory structure, I want in. I started on a (highly) [experimental package manager](https://github.com/wmhilton/require.node-modules.io) a little while ago. One of my goals is to eventually be able to require() dependency tarballs directly, rather than have to extract them first. This adds some safety from having immutable dependencies, and allows you to verify the tarball checksum at any point in the future (say, just before loading) to make sure it hasn't been altered. (My initial prototyping utilized [archivemount](https://linux.die.net/man/1/archivemount) to mount the tarballs in the FUSE file system in read-only mode. ) BUT it has the interesting effect that you cannot put symlinks inside the package's `node_modules` folder, because the package folder is read-only. So I had to invent an entirely new store directory structure that is different from `pnpm` and `ied 1.x`. (Actually it looks similar to the directory structure used by `ied 2.x`... although I can't tell because `ied 2.x` has never worked on my machine.) Any opportunity to collaborate would be great for motivating me to continue working on the project. :)

But back to the spec: Yes, I think formalising the symlink-based installation procedure is a good idea. On the one hand it makes a stronger case for not ""deprecating"" the preserve-symlink module resolution, on the other way it would provide some common ground for ied, pnpm and whatever comes next.

I would suggest we keep this issue open as a discussion forum for ongoing work on this spec while writing some technical documentation on how the resolution is supposed to work (including the currently available module resolution in Node, since we might have to patch Node if everything goes wrong).

I'm going to come up with an initial draft this weekend, if anyone else wants to own this (@zkochan   you seem exited about this 😄 ) and / or already has some docs, I would suggest we work from there.

I am not really familiar with the ied store structure but let me describe the pnpm one. And I think there are many good ideas in the pnpm store structure.

## .modules.yaml

First of all we have a `.modules.yaml` in the root of every node_modules folder. It contains currently just one property with the store location. E.g.:

``` yaml
storePath: 'C:\Users\zoltan.kochan\.pnpm\.store\nested'
```

We use this like a checksum. If someone tries to install a new package using a diferent store, pnpm throws an exception. One node_modules should use one store. (On the other hand, one store can be used by many node_modules)

## .store.yaml

In `store.yaml` we store the dependency graph of the store. We need it mostly for uninstall, as far as I remember. It is in the root of the store and looks like this:

``` yaml
pnpm: 0.45.0
type: nested
preserveSymlinks: true
packages:
  'C:/Users/zoltan.kochan/.pnpm':
    dependencies:
      npmrc: npmrc@1.1.1
      gulp: gulp@3.9.1
  npmrc@1.1.1:
    dependents:
      - 'C:/Users/zoltan.kochan/.pnpm'

    dependencies:
      ms: ms@0.7.2
...
```

## Store directory structure

pnpm tries to make user friendly names for directories in the store. So for foo@1.0.0 there will be a directory called like that in the store. For a package resolved via github, there would be a directory called as the repo URL (escaped to be a valid folder name).

I think the store structure should be human friendly, when possible. I would suggest to make the structure something like this: `<package source>/<package name>/<package version>`.

So for a package resolved from the official npm registry, the path to the package would look like: `.store/registry.npmjs.org/gulp/2.1.0/`

to a git-hosted package mayby something like: `.store/github/alexGugel/ied/b246270b53e43f1dc469df0c9b9ce19bb881e932/`

except yours is a doubly-linked list because it has `dependents` too. I suppose that makes uninstalling packages simpler? Because you'd be doing reference counting rather than garbage collection? I kinda like that.

> So for a package resolved from the official npm registry, the path to the package would look like: `.store/registry.npmjs.org/gulp/2.1.0/`

I like that idea! But I'd say we make the second example `.store/github.com/...` for consistency. Namespace using domains. Almost everything has a website. Even if it's non-traditional (ipfs, gittorrent, dat) you can still namespace by domain (ipfs.io, datproject.org) even if the content isn't physically stored on that domain.

This is really interesting!

> zkochan: Is it OK to use git tags? Git tags are mutable. Someone can tag a different commit

And my original thought was, well npm allows mutable tags like `latest`. I thought I was addressing that by requiring annotated (full) git tags. But something in the way zkochan worded that made me think about security. What if someone maliciously changed git tags? Or for that matter replaced versioned packages in npm, assuming they figured out how to publish over an existing package. Even man in the middle attacks or simply file corruption. I suggest we store an exact hash of the package in the store.yml in addition to the semver. Maybe we need to include a hash in the filesystem path too to guarantee that unique packages have unique locations, but if the store is the source-of-truth I don't think that's necessary.

I'm not happy about this either and I've been trying to prevent this change in Node from the start.

In fact, the issue addressing this is currently one of the [most-commented on issues](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/3402) on the Node issue tracker.

The fundamental problem is that Node used to identify required modules by their real path, rather by the path of their symlink (it currently still does).

Eventually the decision was made to use the path of the symlink for some rather obscure reasons. After this broke all kinds of packages (not just package managers like ied and [pnpm](https://github.com/rstacruz/pnpm/issues/244)), the PR was eventually [reverted](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/6721). To allow people to use the ""new"" behaviour, a new [flag was added](https://github.com/nodejs/node/commit/5d38d543cdd25962fadc49a997798d156a41e4c7).

**Edit:** I just noticed this is completely unrelated to your issue and that I haven't slept for quite some time. So don't get too confused about my above comment.

I did not see any plans about deprecating `--preserve-symlinks`. Just [this comment](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/8749#issuecomment-249571388)

However, even if they plan to do it, they will have to do it as a breaking change, so it'll be not sooner than in version 8. Hence we have like a year to make yarn/pnpm popular enough to be taken into account by the Node.js team.

Not quite sure how to feel about that. Definitely a great idea if we decide to split the project up into multiple repos, similar to the Node org.

> Decide once for all if we keep the name/branding (Personally I quite like it)

We could definitely need some help there. I've been extremely bad at managing the whole naming issue. I personally don't think it's a massive problem. There are names that are far worse.

Definitely agreed. I talked to a friend of mine who is a designer. Other than that, any kind of suggestion is of course welcome.

> Use more sensible defaults (like build by default)

Absolutely. I also want to add another one here: Use some sort of config file instead of purely relying on environment variables.

> Start a new PR round when ready (HackerNews/Reddit)

Sounds good. Totally agree with you there.

One thing that we should definitely change in my opinion is the indenting. The whole JS world uses spaces (both airbnb and feross/standard styleguide do recommend spaces), as an open-source library, this project should try to closely follow commonly used standards.

I think there are a lot of good changes in there, but a lot of things are just a matter of taste I think.

E.g. I don't think using `forEach` instead of `for of` is necessarily ""better"", so I don't really think it makes sense to change that kind of stuff. I don't feel strongly about balanced spacing in params. Not sure if it really makes sense to change it.

I really like the tooling changes, e.g. the Mocha config etc. Also consistently using template strings is a great idea. And we definitely needed test coverage.

Concerning tabs vs spaces: I'm using a tabstop of 8, but I realise that the rest of the world uses either 2 or 4. I think using a tabstop of 8 makes it more painful to write deeply nested functions. I think that's generally speaking not a bad thing.

Any chance we can keep 5702f15 separate and discuss the changes to the linting rules first?

- regarding `forEach` instead of `for of`, I'm not encountering `for of` in most of the code I'm looking into so I'm not ""used to it"", `forEach` is shorter of both 1 LOC and 1 variable definition so it looks like a little bit more simple/elegant to me but I'll gladly revert it if you want. 
- regarding balanced spacing in params, I tried to go for the rule that enforced the least changes. But usually the related eslint-rules are [object-curly-spacing](http://eslint.org/docs/rules/object-curly-spacing) and [array-bracket-spacing](http://eslint.org/docs/rules/array-bracket-spacing), so one issue with the code was that import statements did not respect curly-spacing ever, and it was mixed for inline objects.

Let's enumerate the risk here so we know how to best address it:

The baseline risk is that a malicious package will spawn some processes, read/delete files, etc. All of this can be done upon an initial `require()`, but difference is in which user context it can do so.

It's (somewhat) common for some users to install packages as root but run the node process as a restricted user. It's very common to install global packages as root. 

So we can do two things:
1. Like homebrew, nag the user if they're intentionally/unintentionally running `ied` as root without the `--global` flag
2. When installing packages as root, global or otherwise, require whitelisting packages that are allowed to run scripts. I would see this as a separate field in `package.json`, and an attribute in `ied-shrinkwrap.json` (when that comes, and when it does, it should specify `@author:package@version::hash`).

Don't throw out the baby with the bathwater, I think junctions for the directories was the right choice. There's no reason .bin files must use the same technology as the module version links.

I think npm's behavior for .bin scripts is the best here, and would like very much if ied adopted it:
- create .cmd file for Windows native tools (cmd, powershell, etc)
- create shell script (without extension) for Cygwin and MSYS

Every bug fix is per definition a breaking change of existing behavior, and some code might depend on the broken behavior. And it is impossible to guarantee that a non-trivial code change or even a refactoring doesn't break any existing code out there.

The reality is therefore that every update of any dependency must be verified via testing (automated or manual) before deploying to production. The version number change merely gives an indication of the magnitude of changes to expect: a patch release is very unlikely to require code changes, while one should read the release notes and upgrade instructions when moving to a new major release, because its very likely you have to change the way you use the library. 

Saving exact version numbers of all dependencies is therefore the only way to guarantee any type of sanity when dealing with a fast moving ecosystem like Node.js. I'd like to encourage ied to use it as the default.

Semver is great, but only when it is enforced automatically. In npm, that is not the case. Package maintainers sometimes make mistakes and publish changes under patch and minor versions they didn't realize were breaking changes. This isn't semver's fault; people make mistakes.

[Elm uses semver](https://twitter.com/czaplic/status/601826927838650369) as well, but because the language has static types/inference, versioning is left out of the hands of the package author and put into the platform. You cannot publish breaking changes to non-major versions because exposed APIs are verified through the package manager as to whether having been changed or not in a breaking fashion. This is something that unfortunately cannot be done in JS/npm.

So for those reasons, my vote would be to save-exact by default, and ""opt-in"" to packages you trust to follow semver by manually managing version ranges.

We don't understand tags for now, but it would be good to implement.

The condition in the [`resolve.js`](https://github.com/alexanderGugel/ied/blob/master/lib%2Fresolve.js#L17) should pass tags to `resolveFromNpm`.

the `resolveFromNpm` function itself should resolve tag to the actual version using `dist-tags` property from the response from npm-registry.

Also, we need to save actual version rather than tag into `package.json` like NPM does it.

It's also not always clear how control flows through handlers, and if you forget to return proper values from handlers you may just end up not propagating values that really should have been. Promises being async by spec as well makes it difficult to properly trace execution, since you lose the stack.

There's a lot of apparent magic in promises and using them for control flow, as opposed to the original intent – the promise of a future value, where syntactically they have limited purpose in current javascript, case in point: async/await which hides them entirely – is likely going to cause more harm than good, unless you're intimately familiar with the pitfalls.

RxJS and observables are the future :). I don't really want to start a massive promise vs no promises discussion TBH. I don't want to use them. Reasons:
1. They don't really simplify control flow IMO (compared to async).
2. If you have super nested callbacks, something is wrong with your code in the first place IMO
3. Name your callbacks, split them out and they're already more readable.
4. Callbacks are easier to explain to people (I actually made the experience with a couple of grads that it's much easier for people to understand and **explain** Observables then promises). This is an important selling point IMO.
5. Adding another promise library (such as Bluebird) as a dependency should be avoided if possible.

That being said, I don't feel religious about it, but I just don't see the need to use promises TBH.

Happy to help you finish the conversion. Please let me know what still needs addressing.

My hunch is that we don't really need the kind of event-based flow that RxJS provides, and that the simpler flow Promises handle (single action flowing through a number of async functions) is fine. But there's only one way to be sure, and that's to finish the rewrite.

Once the RxJS rewrite is finished and Babel is in `master` it would be trivial to rewrite the async parts to use `async/await` if we determine it's simpler.

> Since Node.js looks up the realpath of any modules it loads (that is, resolves symlinks), and then looks for their dependencies in the node_modules folders as described

With `ied` that `eslint` module ends up at `node_modules/xyz123` instead of the symlink virtual path of `node_modules/standard/node_modules/eslint`  therefor it can't see the other symlinks in `node_modules/standard/node_modules/` such as the one to `eslint-plugins-standard`.

you can't always expect `name@version` to be unique if you're also fetching from non-npm registries (eg, installing from tarballs). this is a possible case in a dependency tree like:

```
- foo@1.0.0
  - jquery@1.9.0
  - lodash@4.0.0
- bar@1.0.0
  - a patched lodash@4.0.0 fetched from git or http
```

in those cases, you can use `name@version#hash` (where `hash` is derived from the URL or something) for the non-npm-based modules.

So I looked elsewhere for possible workarounds and I found a weird way to get `ied` to work – by setting the http/https agent to keepAlive connections in  [lib/protocol_to_agent.js](https://github.com/alexanderGugel/ied/blob/master/lib/protocol_to_agent.js#L16-L20):

``` js
var agentConfig = {
  keepAlive: true,
  keepAliveMsecs: 5000
}

var protocolToAgent = {
  'http:': httpProxy || new http.Agent(agentConfig),
  'https:': httpsProxy || new https.Agent(agentConfig)
}
```

I have seen a single `ENOTFOUND` error since making this change, so apparently it doesn't cure us of the problem entirely, but after multiple clean installs I have only seen the issue return that once.

---

Would be interested to see if this has any negative or positive performance impact, because this was blocking me from installing anything, I have no baseline to compare against, other than npm itself.

Compare ied and npm installing the same package.json:

#### ied

```
> rm -Rf ./node_modules && rm -Rf ~/.ied_cache
> time ied install
ied install  8.33s user 3.32s system 95% cpu 12.204 total
```

#### npm 2.14.7

```
> rm -rf ./node_modules # not cleaning npm cache because slow enough as-is.
> time npm install --silent
npm install --silent  51.60s user 20.30s system 114% cpu 1:02.74 total

I think that's too big of a trade-off, because there won't be a way to warn Windows users when such a thing happens, whereas in the worst case of the symbolic link scenario they will be able to get an informative message.
Also, a new command would have to be made that regenerates all of the junctions, and it would only be useful for Windows users.

The problem is, powershell has to be launched in order to launch cmd in the elevated mode (which prompts the user). Each time cmd is launched, there is a prompt. That means a lot of prompts for one install.
This is caused by powershell being unable to launch cmd ""in the same window"" (so that we'd be able to  issue the mklink command directly) and with the ""runas"" verb (which gives us the elevated mode).

So I suggest doing one of these:
- warn Windows users when elevated mode is not detected
- create a little bootstrapping script, which will detect if the program is running in an elevated mode, and if not, then launch ied with all arguments through powershell in the elevated mode (and then exit) - this will add an overhead of a couple of ms + MBs needed for a new process, but it should be small compared to the main program

FYI, I ran into a similar problem with one of my modules recently, and my approach was to make ""pointer"" modules that look something like this:

package.json: 

```
{
    ""name"": ""{{modulename}}"",
    ""private"": true,
    ""version"": ""{{moduleversion}}""
}
```

index.js:

```
module.exports = require(__dirname + '/' + '{{relative/path/to/actual/module}}')

Obviously it's not as general as proper symlink because it only works for modules, but I thought I'd mention it just in case.

Constructive comments **only**, please. I originally said that I would rename ied as soon as I decided on a better name. This hasn't happened, yet. I closed all previous issues because I wanted to avoid a giant discussion without any meaningful results and with personal insults as a consequence.

Insulting comments will be deleted, but also replies that don't contribute to the discussion in any meaningful way (this includes personal experiences and situations of family members - while they may be sad, those stories do **not** belong here).

Before I started working on `ied`, I asked in the `npm` IRC channel why `npm` doesn't do what `ied` does (in terms of symlinks + CAS). Below is an excerpt of the conversation we had (yes, I logged in as `nodejsnoob` - because I thought I was missing something obvious, I left out a couple of messages for the sake of brevity):

[...]

```
[22:38] <nodejsnoob> why can't it be like a CAS, with additional ""root-level"" symlinks from the actual ""real"" names?
[22:39] <nodejsnoob> e.g. the checksum of a package would be used as ""real"" location, while an additional symlink, e.g. `my_package/node_modules/tape` would link to  `my_package/node_modules/[checksum of specific tape version]`
```

[...]

```
[22:39] <Aria> A different kind of complexity.
[22:40] == nodejsnoob has changed nick to alexanderGugel
[22:40] <Aria> Also there are a couple non-obvious things about symlinks: node looks for modules in the parent directory of a module's _real_ path.
[22:40] <ljharb> also then it would be hard to modify node modules on the filesystem manually, and have your changes reflected
[22:40] <alexanderGugel> Why? The package.json files from the registry already include the checksum
[22:40] <alexanderGugel> that's true. didn't think of that.
[22:40] <Aria> Yeah, that's a validator for the data. Not an identity for the package.
[22:41] == proudlygeek [~proudlyge@81-65-221-226.rev.numericable.fr] has joined #npm
[22:42] <alexanderGugel> Aria: Where is the difference? Can't we assume that the specific version of the package is not going to change?
```

[...]

And - finally - the quote I've been looking for: ""not a humane design""

```
[22:43] <Aria> Generally, yes. But it's just completely not a humane design. And this is the path of least resistance.
```

I think that would be a good self-ironic name. Thoughts?

I want to change the name before christmas if possible, but we need to be careful I think.

A changed name might attract new users (e.g. babel's name change was _quite_ a [big thing](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9052478)), those users will judge us based on the functionality we have. At the same time it might confuse those who have already heard of this project and know it as ""ied"".

Therefore I want to have some additional features in there before we do this and maybe some visual magic (e.g. a real website etc.). Those features include:
1. **Private** scoped packages (public ones are already supported)
2. Support for arbitrary tarballs
3. Support for git dependencies
   (4. Publishing)
   (5. Windows support)

I was quite busy last week, so I didn't get to a lot of the stuff I wanted to. This week I want to at least finish off 1. and 3.

Shoutout to @FarhadG also! He offered to design a logo!

The issue is that ied currently only supports plain, old installs of npm packages. It looks like `engine.io` is [declared](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io/blob/master/package.json#L24) as a GitHub dependency. This is currently not supported.

I'm working on supporting all kinds of packages as we speak. This change will include lifecycle events (such as postinstall). I expect to have that done by the end of this week.

You can see the current progress on that side here: https://github.com/alexanderGugel/ied/issues/7#issuecomment-157316751

Concerning the progress bar: Determining progress on installations is hard to get right. It's not really a race condition, but rather that the package has been resolved (as ""in the `package.json` has been fetched from the registry"", but the download hasn't kicked in yet).

Truth being told, the progress bar sucks currently. It took npm four years to get that part right, now I understand why :smile:

Different parts of npm support shrinkwrap to different levels - for instance, [npm-prune is shrinkwrap unaware](https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-nodejs/issues/282#issuecomment-160877795).

Given the issues with shrinkwrap's implementation (both in npm 2 and 3), many users avoid it in favor of just pinned dependencies in package.json. This is not a perfect solution, but it is pragmatic, and I recommend it to many of our users at Heroku when they run into [edge-cases in the current shrinkwrap implementation](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+shrinkwrap).

Additionally, the workflow required when using shrinkwrap can be onerous.

If ied can implement shrinkwrap in an npm-compatible way, that would be great, but the node.js community needs an effective, fast, and simple dependency-locking solution. If this can best be accomplished outside of npm-shrinkwrap, then I'd say go for it.

It seems to me that it would logically follow that my top-level dependencies break because of their floating top-level dependencies?

Either way, I'm not especially concerned with shrinkwrap as a way to avoid breakage - I'm more interested in it as a tool to produce consistently reproducible builds across multiple machines.

Most likely through some sort of global config (very simple `.npmrc`-like file) or environment variables.

> If a bug exists in the ied-locking implementation, that bug may exist in all scripts made with that version of ied, since dependencies won't be declarative, correct?

Yup. But I think it would less error-prone to generate a fairly simple, imperative script than a more complicated declarative manifest via a ied.

> I'm curious to see more of the benefits of a script-based, vs declarative solution. Is the primary goal just to make it so users don't all have to install ied?

Primarily, yes. Forcing users to use npm to install ied to install their dependencies might be too complicated / annoying for a lot of users. Just running `node shrinkwrapped.js` might be the easiest solution.

While `unpublish` is [unfortunately not going away](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/12017#issuecomment-200145661), at least identifying packages by hash could prevent the very real danger of someone (even someone at npm) republishing a package with the same version number.

According to npm, it's not possible to republish a module with the same version, even if the repo has been deleted. That's good, but it would be great if an `ied` shrinkwrap could go a step further and pin by author and hash.

Hopefully someday soon npm will support signing packages as well.

:+1: for breaking compat with the existing shrinkwrap format for the purpose of adding functionality and preserving repeatable builds. Shrinkwrap is broken anyway (especially in npm@2) and has multiple redundant fields. There's very little lost there anyway.

I work with @hunterloftis at heroku and I worked on Bundler, the Ruby dependency manager, for a few years. One of the features that was added in 1.1, was this flag called `--standalone`. The premise behind it was to allow a prebundled app to be run without needing Bundler installed for packaging purposes. I think a feature like this would solve https://github.com/alexanderGugel/ied/issues/23#issuecomment-178874457. As an example of how this works:

In Bundler, we have a `Gemfile` which is equivalent to a `package.json`. In this case I have one dep.

``` ruby
source ""https://rubygems.org""

gem 'rspec'
```

A `Gemfile.lock` gets produced by running `bundle install` which is a resolution graph of all the dependencies and their dependencies. In node land, this would be more complicated b/c of the forest of dependencies. The benefit of something like this is when you want to remove/update a particular dependency, you get conservative updating. What I mean by this is when you want to update a dependency A, the existing resolver can base the new solution upon an existing solution and only introduce the minimum number of dependency changes needed to update A. So, if it could get away with just updating A, it would do that. Also, with removing a dependency, in Bundler you can simply remove that dependency from the `Gemfile` and re-run `bundle install` and the `Gemfile.lock` will have the new solution. Contrast with shrinkwrap where removing a node module either involves reshrinkwrapping after you removed a single line from your `package.json`. You can also manually copy the diffs / changes you want, but that can get nasty.

```
GEM
  remote: https://rubygems.org/
  specs:
    diff-lcs (1.2.5)

    rspec-support (3.4.1)

PLATFORMS
  ruby

DEPENDENCIES
  rspec
```

`--standalone` produces a `setup.rb` file that looks something like this:

``` ruby
require 'rbconfig'
# ruby 1.8.7 doesn't define RUBY_ENGINE
ruby_engine = defined?(RUBY_ENGINE) ? RUBY_ENGINE : 'ruby'
ruby_version = RbConfig::CONFIG[""ruby_version""]
path = File.expand_path('..', __FILE__)
$:.unshift ""#{path}/""
$:.unshift ""#{path}/../#{ruby_engine}/#{ruby_version}/gems/diff-lcs-1.2.5/lib""
$:.unshift ""#{path}/../#{ruby_engine}/#{ruby_version}/gems/rspec-support-3.4.1/lib""
$:.unshift ""#{path}/../#{ruby_engine}/#{ruby_version}/gems/rspec-core-3.4.4/lib""
$:.unshift ""#{path}/../#{ruby_engine}/#{ruby_version}/gems/rspec-expectations-3.4.0/lib""
$:.unshift ""#{path}/../#{ruby_engine}/#{ruby_version}/gems/rspec-mocks-3.4.1/lib""
$:.unshift ""#{path}/../#{ruby_engine}/#{ruby_version}/gems/rspec-3.4.0/lib""
```

If you don't know Ruby, `$:` represents the load path of where Ruby looks for libraries, so `require` can find the files. This file manually sets up the load path so you can pull all the deps specified by your `Gemfile.lock`. Now, if this is distributed out/packaged you don't need the bundler runtime at all.

I hope that helps. I'd be happy to discuss things more if people are interested. I also understand node has a unique / different problem space with dependencies, so maybe not everything applies.

At the same time, repeating what has been said before doesn't help anyone. If you have a better name, please let me know (email me at [myfirstname].[mylastname]@gmail.com). This project is very likely to be renamed, I simply haven't decided on a better name yet.

Can we make the behaviour of the basic commands as similar to `npm`s behaviour as possible?

If you need a rationalisation, mine is that `ied [command] [--modifier] [subject(s)]` makes it more obvious that the modifier (e.g. `--save-dev`) is upon the command (e.g. `install`). Basically, it should be this way for the same reason you don't `ied [subject(s)] [command]` (e.g. `ied debug install`).

exactly this. Npm 3 seems like an improvement, but it's slower (seemingly
by design). Plus, shrinkwrap is a disaster in npm 2. I've attempted to
contribute to npm in the past -- the npm devs are great folks -- but
they've inherited a beast, and it's hard to contribute with the state of
the code (this was npm 2) imho.

For some big early gains it seems like you could just hack together a script that will take as input a ton of scripts or commands to install things without any configuration and output an ansible yaml.  You could just throw a ton of these commands at your script and iterate through all of them to give you a flushed out ansibmle yaml file(s) that does all the command installations.

Your project could also point users to these other projects since @webpro has a more micromanagement style of curating his list without actually doing any of the research behind those projects that add value and diminish by leaving those that aren't of any value or have severe bit-rot. You could also perhaps help contribute to these approaches that take all the learnings from many of the outdated projects projects on @webpro 's (https://github.com/webpro/awesome-dotfiles), your very popular but more prescriptive approach (https://github.com/donnemartin/dev-setup), my very prescriptive approach (https://github.com/johnwyles/bootstrap-macos), and improves upon them (https://github.com/adityarpillai/jumpstart).",NA,https://api.github.com/repos/donnemartin/dev-setup/issues/91/comments,https://github.com/donnemartin/dev-setup/issues/91#issuecomment-462060369,https://api.github.com/repos/donnemartin/dev-setup/issues/91

There was also a program installed called suspicious package.app which didn't seem to do anything, copyrights says mothers ruin software 2008-2016.

I'll make a report on the cask page as well tomorrow and see if I can track

Although you can still failproof your application by checking to see if
things are already installed and skipping them. Dunno which is a better
solution yet, hopefully upstream in brew cask is easy fix.

This [Stack Overflow post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20802320/detect-if-homebrew-package-is-installed/20802425#20802425) seems to indicate this needs to be done per item installed.  `brew.sh` installs many packages and I'm not sure about doing this check for each one, if I understand the post correctly.

I'm not a Zsh user myself, but this seems like a good resource:

http://sourabhbajaj.com/mac-setup/iTerm/zsh.html

If you're doing a good amount of config like in the article above, you could create a new shell script to hold all of the commands, ie `zsh.sh`.   See similar scripts like `pydata.sh` or `aws.sh` as examples.

If you're using the `.dots` script to chain the shell scripts together, just add an entry to call your `zsh.sh` script.

```
        if [ $ARG == ""zsh"" ] || [ $ARG == ""all"" ]; then
            # Run the zsh.sh Script
            echo ""------------------------------""
            echo ""Setting up Zsh.""
            echo ""------------------------------""
            echo """"
            ./zsh.sh
        fi
```

Then from the command line you just run something like this:

```
$ ./.dots bootstrap osxprep brew osx zsh
```

Renaming `.dots` to `setup.sh` makes sense, but would require updates to the `README`.  Maybe this can come in a second pass.

I think that having these files mixed with all the rest makes things more complicated to use and understand. For instance, in my own custom branch, I do have another directory `Filters` that is meant to be copied at `/Library/Filters/` (this allows Preview to choose the resolution when exporting to a PDF). So, then I need to modify bootstrap.ch to ignore also this directory.
Also, the .gitignore file in this git repository is misleading, as it is both used to copy itself to the user home directory, and it is used also as the .gitignore file of this repo.

Maybe we could rename this dir `files` to `homefiles`. Then, it is clear for everybody that bootstrap syncs this dir to the use home dir. we could even rename `bootstrap.sh` to `sync_homefiles.sh` to make it even more clear.

Also, there are currently 63 commits in this single PR.  I think one logical change per PR is ideal.  I didn't have a chance to look at all 63 commits, perhaps you can submit PRs for each of these?

Great to hear from you again!  Appreciate your continued help with keeping dev-setup updated.

It's been awhile since I've done a clean install, although I think I recall on my runs the following was sufficient for an unattended install:

```
# Ask for the administrator password upfront.
sudo -v

# Keep-alive: update existing `sudo` time stamp until the script has finished.
while true; do sudo -n true; sleep 60; kill -0 ""$$"" || exit; done 2>/dev/null &
```

It seems this isn't working for all cases and we need additional keep alives?

---

On a perhaps related note, there are a couple scripts `aws.sh` and `pydata.sh` that specifically do not pip install with `sudo` which might be causing this issue:

```
# Removed user's cached credentials
# This script might be run with .dots, which uses elevated privileges
sudo -K
```

If this is the culprit, maybe these two scripts should be run at the end of [.dots](https://github.com/donnemartin/dev-setup/blob/master/.dots).

Sorry, I still don't get the point. The issue of #105 seems to be closed since upstream of xonsh had merged the patches.

The gitsome with my patches works fine for me, and got no bug report both in Debian [1] and Ubuntu [2] over past 10 months.

Could anyone provide the reproducible steps for python3.6 error in gitsome after applying my patches? I can have a look afterwards.

With the proposed changes on my test GitHub Enterprise instance, the `gh view` command results in a url like this:

```
https://1.2.3.4/https://1.2.3.4/donnemartin/foo
```

I think we'd need to conditionally add self.gh_url, maybe something like this:

```
def view(self, index, view_in_browser=False):
...
    if self.gh_url not in url:
        url = self.gh_url + url
    self.web_viewer.view_url(url)
```

Also, it seems we'll need to send auth info in `generate_url_contents`, otherwise it seems like we're not able to access GitHub Enterprise pages without it (it asks you to sign in).

From https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html:

On my system, I don't have $XDG_CONFIG_HOME configured.  It seems like we'd have to add additional logic to set the path to `$HOME/.config`?

Also, curious how this affects Windows.

I think the results from the API might have changed which might have caused this issue.  

Note how the `description` key lookup is wrapped in a `try/except` block catching a `KeyError`.  I suspect the `description` key might not have been sent in the past if the event `description` is missing, but we see it is now sent with a value of `None`.

```
        try:
            item += self._format_indented_message(
                ('' if event.payload['description'] is None
                 else event.payload['description']))
        except KeyError:
            pass
```

I'd leave the code catching `KeyError` in place as a further safeguard.

Yes! Atleast they are working. Or atleast outside of `gitsome`.

I just found out about gitsome, and tried to install it on two different machines (one Windows 10, one macOS 10.12).  On both machines, I can get autocompletions for gh commands but not for git commands.  When I type `git `, the autocomplete list doesn't contain any git commands.  On the Mac the autocomplete only lists files and folders.  On the Windows machine, it lists files and folders as well as python types and keywords (the Windows machine looks exactly like @Nikitaw99's gif at the top of this thread).  As I said, both of these are brand new installations of gitsome, I haven't changed any configurations or aliased hub or anything.

---
Below are my findings so far, Hopefully this helps other people trying to figure out why it isn't working.
The ""**$BASH_COMPLETIONS**""  variable returns the below value (paths) in gitsome on my machine 
`['/etc/bash_completion', '/usr/share/bash-completion/completions/git']`
which does not exist on my machine with git v2.10.2 installed on my machine. The actual path for the git completion resides here 
`C:\Program Files\Git\mingw64\share\git\completion\git-completion.bash`
I've added this path to the "".xonshrc"" file but that didn't solve the problem. The other thing I tried was to create a symlink to `C:\Program Files\Git\mingw64\share\git\completion` with the name `git` in `/usr/share/bash-completion/completions/git` and unfortunately that didn't solve the problem either. 
I do agree with @orionlee on this being an issue with the xonsh layer as I've noticed a few issues posted by users regarding xonsh and git not working well together, I'm listing a few of them here.

I did some naive grepping in the included version of xonsh:

```
c:\data\external\gitsome\xonsh (master)
λ grep -R ""gitsome""
base_shell.py:        self.gitsome = None
base_shell.py:        t = 'gitsome'
main.py:from gitsome import __version__ as gitsome_version
main.py:                    version='/'.join(('gitsome', gitsome_version)),
main.py:    click.echo('Version: ' + gitsome_version)
prompt_toolkit_completer.py:from gitsome.completer import CompleterGitsome
prompt_toolkit_completer.py:        self.completer_gitsome = CompleterGitsome()
prompt_toolkit_completer.py:        completions_gitsome = \
prompt_toolkit_completer.py:            self.completer_gitsome.get_completions(document,
prompt_toolkit_completer.py:            self.completer_gitsome.build_completions_with_meta(line,

prompt_toolkit_completer.py:        completions_gitsome.extend(completions_with_meta)
prompt_toolkit_completer.py:        for comp in completions_gitsome:
```

If this looks right, then there needs to be an extension point for completions and it would be nice to include the version numbers of the extension in the xonsh version information?

            ctx[ev] = path.decode().strip()
    # Override path-related bash variables; on Windows bash uses
    # /c/Windows/System32 syntax instead of C:\\Windows\\System32

which fixes it for me, but requires cygpath to be available (so not a generic fix). Reimplementing cygpath is apparently non-trivial (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10884268/convert-posix-win-path-in-cygwin-python-w-o-calling-cygpath/10887350#10887350), but that is a problem for xonsh.

Among other things, if the user doesn't have `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` set in their shell environment, the path expands to `/<config_file_name>`, which should bomb with an error because `gh` won't be able to write to that location (and it _shouldn't_ write anything there).

The correct approach would define a configuration search path for each configuration `<file>`. The path for *nix users would be:

  * `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gitsome/<file>`
  * `~/.config/gitsome/<file>`, assuming `~/.config` exists and `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is unset
  * fall back to `~/.gitsome/<file>`

The technically appropriate places on Windows and OS X are, respectively, `%APPDATA%\gitsome\<file>` and `~/Library/Application Support/gitsome/<file>` but given the nature of this app I think you can get away with just calling it `~/.gitsome/<file>`  (i.e. user's home directory).

One thing I do believe (and is reflected in the above pathing suggestions) is that, rather than having multiple dotfiles in the user's home directory, they should be grouped in a dotdir, i.e. `.gitsome/`.  This lets you store whatever you need to in that directory without cluttering `$HOME`.

Also, I am of the opinion that if `gitsome` is installed in a virtual environment (i.e., `$VIRTUAL_ENV` or `%VIRTUAL_ENV%` is set), its configuration data should live in that environment.  Or at least, the user should have the option to specify that configuration files outside the virtual environment can be overridden by config files the virtual environment.  I may be the only one who cares about this last bit, though ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.

This allows you to use the Authorizations API to create an OAuth token. If you're using other APIs and have 2FA enabled, you should authenticate using an OAuth token (instead of with username+password) because using an OAuth token doesn't require you to enter an OTP when making API calls.

Yeah, the Personal Token API is a bit weird, I had some exchange with support as well:

>  [snip] I believe we intentionally send 2FA OTPs via SMS only for PUT and POST requests to the authorizations API. Normally, you'd use a PUT or a POST to create a token, and then continue using that token for making API requests. Once you're done with the token -- you can revoke it via the web UI. Again, I agree it would be great if DELETEs sent an SMS as well, so I've opened an internal issue to see if we'd consider changing that. I can't promise an ETA, but we'll followup as soon as there's any news. For now, if you need an SMS for any API call -- you can trigger it with a POST to the authorizations API and then use the OTP for the call you really want to make.

So IIRC, the OTP are short lived, but you can use them for 2 differents requests, and can basically make a ""fake"" request that will just trigger the OTP to be sent, and then do your real requests. 

My guess is that personal access token are a 2cd class citizen, and that's understandable, as they are inherently less secure than OAuth token, and that GitHub docs is mostly targeted as online services hooking up into GitHub (hence the response 2FA sms only for token request which might be true). Though the personal access token are technically login-in as **you** who are trying to do something on your repo, and not as an entity doing something on your behalf. 

Anyway, I might give that a go at some point. I also have a yubi key in some drawer, I shoudl dig that out to see how it can be used for 2fa.

A few things to try:
- Do you have the same issues if you run in good old Terminal?
- It might help to try and install in a [`virtualenv`](https://github.com/donnemartin/gitsome/blob/master/INSTALLATION.md), I just updated the instructions to explicitly set the Python version when creating a virtual environment

Depending on your system, you might need to run `pip3`, possibly with the `-H` flag:

```
$ sudo -H pip3 install gitsome

For most linux users, `pip3` can be installed on your system using the `python3-pip` package. 

For example, Ubuntu users can use:

$ sudo apt-get install python3-pip

I am familiar with Gitlab internals, I have GDK installed and Gitlab-from-source working, and have both production and test systems running gitlab-omnibus that I can use to develop and test against, and I have done a bit of work in Python with the gitlab API wrapper.

Another nice python-gitlab api based tool that I have used is over here, it's used to clean old artifacts up, something gitlab itself lacks:

https://github.com/JonathonReinhart/gitlab-artifact-cleanup

From working with that, I'd say it's possible that some of the APIs we would need for this integration may require changes to python-gitlab, as Jonathon hit several areas where the api wrapper is incomplete.

I have been poking around the codebase for `gitsome` and `python-gitlab` a bit and I agree, there will probably be some functional changes/extensions to `python-gitlab` in the process of adding gitlab functionality to gitsome. I've forked this project and have started making minor tweaks... I've yet to start thinking about the best way to integrate something like `python-gitlab` into the project beyond the basics until I wrap my head around what's already in place. 

So far, the more obvious notes I have are:
- move the `cli()` function from `main_cli.py` to `githubcli.py` and delete `main_cli.py`
- to change the entrypoints in setup.py to point directly to `githubcli:cli`
- add a `gitlab.py` and `gitlabcli.py` to accommodate gitlab-specific API and CLI interfaces
- add `python-gitlab` (or another utility) to `gitsome/lib`

What I haven't figured out yet is exactly how these changes will impact `config.py` which seems to be quite github-centric. I'm open to ideas!

Just for feedback, however, here's an annotated summary of what happened to me. I got a few messages that may be of interest. This is on a recent install of Linux Mint.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/donnemartin/gitsome.git
$ cd gitsome/
$ pip install -e
The program 'pip' is currently not installed. You can install it by typing:
sudo apt install python-pip

```
$ sudo apt install python-pip
The following additional packages will be installed:
  python-pip-whl
The following NEW packages will be installed:
  python-pip python-pip-whl

You are using pip version 8.1.1, however version 8.1.2 is available.
You should consider upgrading via the 'pip install --upgrade pip' command.
```

#### Upgrade something that I just installed? Um, OK. I'll run the upgrade command then.

```

You are using pip version 8.1.1, however version 8.1.2 is available.
You should consider upgrading via the 'pip install --upgrade pip' command.
```

#### Weird. I did what the message recommended, but the message keeps recommending it. Looked back at the gitsome instructions and decided to try pip3 instead of pip.

```
$ sudo apt-get install python3-pip

```

@johntdyer @bradparks do you mind testing to verify it works on your end?  Since the changes are not yet on PyPI, here are two options discussed in the `README` to get it.

You might need to use `sudo` or `pip3`, check out the install section instructions for more details.

### Option 1

...

You can also install the latest `gitsome` from GitHub source which can contain changes not yet pushed to PyPI:

```
$ pip install git+https://github.com/donnemartin/gitsome.git
```

...

### Option 2

In short:
- Download the `autocomplete.sh` script as mentioned in the existing docs
- Add the following to your `.zshrc`:

``` sh
    autoload bashcompinit
    bashcompinit
    source autocomplete.sh
```

And then it Just Works :)

The variables `num_rows` and `num_cols` are defined as:
```
num_rows = len(str0) + 1
num_cols = len(str1) + 1
```

`i` and `j` iterate over `num_rows` and `num_cols` respectively, but the offending line checks `str0[j - 1]` and `str1[i - 1]`, i.e. `i` and `j` are swapped.

The bug will manifest itself in cases where `len(str0) != len(str1)`",NA,https://api.github.com/repos/donnemartin/interactive-coding-challenges/issues/225/comments,https://github.com/donnemartin/interactive-coding-challenges/issues/225#issuecomment-483064369,https://api.github.com/repos/donnemartin/interactive-coding-challenges/issues/225

Interesting solution, thanks for introducing me to `collections.Counter`.

Would you mind adding a little bit of info about it?  How do you feel about something like this?

Add info here about `collections.Counter`

```
from collections import Counter

- Run code through a linter such as http://pep8online.com/checkresult

Thanks for adding the Pythonic solutions.  Could you provide their time and space complexities?

I like the benchmark section!

I think the solution notebook in particular could use some more polish.  Here are some suggestions:
- There are a couple typos: 'funciton', 'modidication'
- The solution notebook could use some additional formatting, check out existing notebooks as a template.  Examples:
  - Missing author info, title, problem statement
  - Double bullets and capitalization in Algorithm section
  - Several sections/headers missing or not using the templates:
    - Test cases
    - Code header missing
    - Unit Tests header renamed

The requirement change of ""Improve compression by appending count only if count exceeds 2"" makes a lot of sense, although it does make the solution a bit more complex.  Perhaps we should make it a 'follow-up' type question and add another solution as opposed to modifying the existing solution?

Problem: Compress a string such that 'AAABCCDDDD' becomes 'A3B1C2D4'. Only compress the string if it saves space.  What if you don't want to display 'B1' and instead want the output to be 'A3BC2D4'?

Here's a notebook with multiple solutions as a template:

Additional comments:
- The use of tabs instead of spaces is making it hard for me to diff the solutions.  Can you use spaces instead?  Please check out the [style guide](https://github.com/donnemartin/interactive-coding-challenges/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#maintain-consistent-style).
- I wonder if there's a way to reduce the number of times `compressed_string.append` is called from 6x.
- There's a `FIXME` comment left in the submission.

> Only updating the top reference doesn't remove the reference the old top (popped item) has to the new top

Can you point me to a link that discusses this further?

For reference, I believe this is the function we are discussing:

```
    def pop(self):
        if self.top is not None:
            data = self.top.data
            self.top = self.top.next
            return data
        return None
```

It is my understanding that: 
- Python's garbage collector will automatically handle this without the need to ""remove references from the node we want to pop"".  
- If this were C/C++ and that node were created with malloc/new then we should deallocate that memory.

This is looking great, thanks for the challenge.  Here are some comments for consideration:
- It might be helpful to add some more detail to the algorithm discussion, as it is very similar (and in most cases identical) to the actual solution.
- For the time complexity, it seems you are saying this is catalan.  It might be helpful to add a link to this [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_number) as a reference.
- Do you know what the space complexity is?

I've updated the solution information with the following changes:
- I've given a textual description of the algorithm as well as a more explicit description involving the main cases
- I've updated the time complexity description with a link to the Catalan numbers wiki page.
- I've also included the space complexity info, which I checked to be O(n). Correct me if I'm wrong.

Hopefully that should be it for this problem. I'll also add another challenge once I get the time.

Thanks for the pull request.  Here are some comments:
- This is a classic problem, although I believe typically it has a set of chars to remove, not just one char.  How do you feel about extending it to remove one or more chars instead of just one?
- For the remove_char solution, what do you think about providing a solution that doesn't call a built-in function?  For example, add the chars to remove in a hash map and use that as a lookup to determine which chars to remove.
- `remove_char_recur` is using `is` to check for value equality, where `is` is normally used to check reference equality.  See a more detailed discussion [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/132988/is-there-a-difference-between-and-is-in-python).
- One notebook is labeled Challenge, the other is Challenge Notebook
- The solution notebook has a solution notebook index link that's a dead link

The way this is worded, am I correct in interpreting there are other areas with the same issue?  I looked through the other challenges and couldn't find another instance.  I might have missed another case.

Nice work!  I have a few requests for consideration:

-The argument `k` in function `def change_ways(n,k,coins)` doesn't seem to be used at all.
-Could you use `range` instead of `xrange` for Python 3 compatibility?
-It might be helpful to denote what `n` and `m` represent in the time complexity discussion for beginners.
-Can you tweak some of the whitespace between operators and function params?  I find http://pep8online.com is handy for notebook PEP8 validation.

How are you?

For complex solutions like the binary tree implementation, would you like comments? I noticed that it can be hard to follow because it is a lot of code. I'm working on a Graph implementation and hoping to improve the binary tree so it can be released on the main folder. 

Thanks

Great to hear from you again :)

I think comments help for some more complex chunks of code.  I'd be careful about adding too many comments though--I feel generally Python is pretty readable, almost pseudocode.

Thanks again for submitting this pull request.  Here's some feedback for the reverse_words challenge to help it get merged:
- I think it is easier to review and approve pull requests if we have one challenge per pull request.  I'll update the [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/donnemartin/interactive-coding-challenges/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
- Please try to follow the template for notebooks outlined in the [Contributing Guidelines].(https://github.com/donnemartin/interactive-coding-challenges/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
- ""Notebok written by Marco"" contains a typo and is a different format from the other notebooks.
- The Constraints section is also different and isn't a Q&A style as you would typically see in an interview
- The Algorithm discussion is also a different format.  Is the time complexity really n = number of words or is it number of chars?  What is the space complexity?
- The code S = S.split() takes a string ""S"" and splits it into words, but re-uses the same variable ""S"".  This might be clearer as:
  - words = string.split()
- The unit test doesn't check for the case where None is passed in, as described in the Constraints section
- The unit test doesn't use the same format as the other notebooks.
- The challenge notebook copies the same code as the solution notebook instead of using the %load command to prevent code duplication.
- Please check the ""Maintain Consistent Style"" section of the [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/donnemartin/interactive-coding-challenges/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) notebook about code style guidelines and PEP8.

Thank you so much for the feedback. I should have been more careful with the format of the notebooks, but I was sort of carried away with the actual code. I will make those fixes sometime in the next couple of days. 

As for the linked list, I added the is_sorted challenge. Which appears to need the format fixes as well. 

One question, for the unit test, you mean the print statement format? Or the actual code.

I wanted to add that I believe the time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of words because the operation words[::-1] is O(1) and we only iterate over a string of words. Memory complexity is O(n) as well, but n is the number of chars.

> the operation words[::-1] is O(1)

I'm not sure this is accurate, can you point me to your reference?

The two references below seem to indicate each call to words[::-1] is O(k), where k is the slice size.  In this case it seems k = number of characters in the word.  For all words, the sum would appear to be O(n), where n is the number of characters.

To debug just add the following line to the **Code** cell where you want the debugger to start:

```
import pdb; pdb.set_trace()
```

For example, you would add it like this:

```
def unique_chars_hash(string):
    import pdb; pdb.set_trace() # Start debugger when this line is hit
    chars_set = set()
    for char in string:
        if char in chars_set:
            return False
        else:
            chars_set.add(char)
    return True
```

Then **run both the Code and Unit Test cells** (either through the menu ""Cell"", or through a shortcut such as [shift + enter] or [control + enter].

This will drop you into the pdb debugger where you can issue commands like the following to l(ist) the source code:

```
l
```

or n(ext):

```
n
```

For a list of all pdb commands, refer to this [link](https://docs.python.org/2/library/pdb.html#debugger-commands).

Thanks again for the pull request.  Here are a few comments to consider:

-When I ran the solution notebook the unit tests do not pass.  It seems you are not checking for a None input with your alternate solution.
-This seems to be a sorting challenge and might be better placed in the sorting category.  Can we move it to the section ""Sorting and Searching""?
-The solution notebooks have a button ""Edit Metadata"" for each cell which is not present in the challenge notebooks or the other notebooks in the repo.  Can we remove them?
-The hyperlinks to the solution notebooks don't seem to point to the correct solution notebook.
-The code style could be updated to PEP-8: mostly there are whitespace issues around operators like commas.  I've found that http://pep8online.com/ is handy as I haven't yet seen a good solution for PEP-8 checks in notebooks.  With that said, some of the repo notebooks don't follow some PEP-8 guidelines, I'll submit a fix for those :)

- Tests should work now, and they're a little more descriptive.
- I've moved the folder into sorting/searching.
- As far as the hyperlinks go (in readme), they should be 404s right now
  because I have them pointing to where the solution / challenge will reside
  on your repo after the pull request, not to the location on my fork. I
  assume that's the behavior you want.
- I've fixed the pep guidelines, except for one - line 22 in the default
  solution being too long by 10 characters. Either I would need to change my
  variable names to something less descriptive, e.g. ""l"", or add an ugly line
  break.
- Removed ""Edit Metadata""

I accidentally (foolishly) ran some of your solutions from my repo, so I'm
going to revert those files and then let me know if there are any more
issues.

Great!

The two hyperlinks might have tripped you up :)

The challenge notebook Algorithm section still has a link to the following:
https://github.com/donnemartin/interactive-coding-challenges/templates/foo_solution.ipynb

> I've fixed the pep guidelines, except for one - line 22 

Sounds good.

No problem, although this might cause confusion on the version history.  What do you think about submitting another pull request with just the relevant code changes?  I suggest to work off a branch in your fork, load up just the relevant changes, then submit a pull request.

They only resolve the TLD namesevers, which resolve the authoritative nameservers for the desired domain, which resolve the host you're looking for (or nameservers of a subdomain).

As for the clients, `mDNSResponder` is technically a resolver with a cache, not a ""DNS Server"" even tho it's also a multicast dns responder. I don't think it ever goes through the process of retrieving an authoritative response (described above).
On linux we used to have `nscd` which provided a cache of the hosts database. Also not a DNS Server. Today we have systemd-resolved configured as a local caching nameserver on some (many? most?) distributions. This is a DNS Server as you've described. BIND and dnsmasq are other common caching nameservers.

Sometimes one of the server that stores the message copy is unavailable when you issue receive or delete message. When such things happens, the message copy would be still stored at that unavailable server. 

When the server become available again then you issue receive message, you will get that message copy. Thus from your perspective you will get duplicate message.

Actually it is possible to get more duplicate messages, not only twice. AWS only guaranteed `At-Least-Once Delivery` properties for SQS, not `Max-Twice Delivery`. 😂

Pasting the key points here.

Consistency in CAP actually means linearizability, which is a very specific (and very strong) notion of consistency. In particular it has got nothing to do with the C in ACID, even though that C also stands for “consistency”. I explain the meaning of linearizability below.

Availability in CAP is defined as “every request received by a non-failing [database] node in the system must result in a [non-error] response”. It’s not sufficient for some node to be able to handle the request: any non-failing node needs to be able to handle it. Many so-called “highly available” (i.e. low downtime) systems actually do not meet this definition of availability.

Partition Tolerance (terribly mis-named) basically means that you’re communicating over an asynchronous network that may delay or drop messages. The internet and all our datacenters have this property, so you don’t really have any choice in this matter.",NA,https://api.github.com/repos/donnemartin/system-design-primer/issues/297/comments,https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer/pull/297#issuecomment-524546248,https://api.github.com/repos/donnemartin/system-design-primer/issues/297

That is, operations happen in order as they are received by the engine. However in practice no production-level database performs operations in a serializable way, we make compromises and figure out ways to perform operations a bit faster. In this way we trade off performance (expected operation side effects) for scalability. See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZjhNTM8XU8 to learn more about attack vectors on database isolation levels.

Another way is if you wanted to scale some api. Say you have a stock exchange engine running on an api. At first you run it in one location (part of the world) and the performance is fast. But then you start getting customers at the other end of the world and their latency numbers are bad (due to the speed of light and timespace). If you choose to spin up and api instance that is geographically closer to those customers (scale), the latency is shortened for them but now your apis must synchronize between instances. This synchronization will cost you time and extra computation steps, lowering your performance.

As requested I've just updated the README's (including references in ZH versions) and resolved merge conflicts. Apologies for forced pushes, I swapped out old commits for correctly authored signed commits under my actual user name. Initially I leaned on Leader/Follow as statements like this felt somewhat clunky to read:
> It's important to discuss what bottlenecks you might encounter ... For example, what issues are addressed by adding a Load Balancer with multiple Web Servers? CDN? **Primary-Replica Replicas?** ...

So could need re-working maybe?

Also I don't know if you're the sole maintainer on this project, but if you go down the route of swapping `master` -> `main` I would be happy to help out!

- Perisan is a rtl language so it should be rtl!
- This is just a translation. You should not add/remove any sentences to it unless you can not convey the concept with literal translation.
- There are many mispelled words in the document.
- It is better not using conversational words and sentences like 'یاد بگیریم که چطوری ...'
- Don't use a mixture of english and perisan words like 'کامیونیتی' or 'اسکوپ' or 'کش'. If it has not a good translation in Persian, just include the English word.
- ِYou should not combine paragraphs in original text in one paragraph.
- Some important wrong translations: 
    - trade-off: it is 'مصالحه' and is not 'تعادل'.
    - consistency: it is better to use 'سازگاری' for consistency and not using 'یکپارچگی' that is reminiscent of integrity.
    - best effort: it is simply 'بهترین تلاش' and is not 'بهترین روش'.

I started translation of the project in this fork: https://github.com/voitau/system-design-primer/blob/master/README-ru.md

I'm using the translation link from the first post in this thread, where it is possible. Besides adding content which is already missing, some text is also updated to match better the semantics of the original document (subjective!).

Some specifics about the translation. I'm trying a little bit more systematic approach for translation:
* There are some comments in the translated version, which are generated with a [simplistic tool](https://github.com/markdown-localization/mdlm-sh) (implementation inspired by this document!). It splits markdown document into sections for simplifying sync with original document and translation itself.
* To avoid double effort, please check the [Project](https://github.com/voitau/system-design-primer/projects/4) for available tasks for translation
* More details here: [Contributing: Russian translation](https://github.com/voitau/system-design-primer/blob/master/README-ru.md#contributing-russian-translation)

I'm thinking of squashing this PR into a single commit on merge to keep the history clean, otherwise we'd have to do a fair amount of rebasing to clean up the commit messages to bring them more in line with the current commit message history.

Just as an example, a commit message like ""Modify again"" I think could provide more detail on what was changed.  I wonder if we could also standardize commit messages to be English.

Of course the downside of squash is that the individual commits would be combined into one.  We could add an AUTHORS.md or TRANSLATORS.md file with credits for each language and translators, although it looks like there is already translator info in the new translated README, nice!

Although the Trivago blog looks high quality (nice work!), I'm a little torn on this setting a precedent.  I'm inclined to think we should try to keep the blog list in the Appendix relatively small while keeping the link to https://github.com/kilimchoi/engineering-blogs for the **much larger list**.  Otherwise we might be duplicating much of the work in kilimchoi's engineering-blogs repo.

Typically a high scale system will use Kafka, ActiveMQ, RabbitMQ, Mule types of systems for initial persistence and backend workers subscribe to the queue and persist to the storage layer they're responsible for.  This avoids the 'dual write' problem from occurring synchronously during the write path as well as isolating the write path from the variable latency of multiple storage engines.

I can try setting up an example in my fork and make a Pull Request this weekend.

The idea is to use a utility named [pandoc](http://pandoc.org/) that can convert Markdown file to other format such as PDF. We can setup a Travis build by installing the required tool and dependencies for pandoc in order to read Markdown file and generate the PDF file.

EDIT:

Did a quick experiment using Travis CI. I successfully installed pandoc and its required dependencies. However, the build failed when pandoc tries to parse images that are included using Markdown `![Imgur]` syntax, e.g. `![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/ciJelTB.png)`. Before parsing those images, pandoc didn't return any errors so I assume images that are included using HTML `<img>` tag are parsed correctly by pandoc.

Our setup is Phabulous running in Docker, and it works intermittently. With debug on, we see the same as seglo above.

Although our notifications from Phabricator do come through, they are interspersed with a lot of `Hi! Phabulous v3 reporting for duty!`; I think this happens maybe every time the connection fails but haven't investigated that fully yet.

I don't know if Slack have changed something with their Real Time API - I couldn't find anything obvious (unless it's something to do with [this](https://api.slack.com/changelog/2017-10-making-rtm-presence-subscription-only)), but I'm not sure what other explanation there could be 🤔

instead of passing down the config all the way to the module I changed the code so that the module parses the config and pass the additionalMatchers to downstream objects. I would like to extend this functionality to other modules soon.

From my understanding the regular expressions of `LookupCommand::get{,IM,Mention}Matchers()` are responsible for regular patterns that identify messages.
Right now they are strict, including line beginning and ending, e.g. `""^([T|D][0-9]{1,16})$""`. Those should be made more flexible to allow for ""in-line"" matching.

This should resolve the inconsistency problem.

However, there are two limitations from the Slack API:
- So far the bot has been able to post notifications on channels without being invited. With the setting set to `true`, the bot will only be able to post on channels it is invited to.
- The bot cannot automatically change it's profile information, so how it looks (name, image) depends entirely on how the user sets it up.

Relevant setting: https://github.com/etcinit/phabulous/blob/eae12b5c4edbe94bbbaadfce5007e5cd9cb22cd1/config/main.yml#L20

You should be able to pull that branch and try out building it. I'll include this changes on the next release.

In case it's useful to anyone, I did some digging on what this would require:

The incoming webhook payload does not contain any reference to comments. It does however include an objectPHID (id of the task/revision/... in question) as `storyData[objectPHID]`, and 1 or more transactionPHIDs in `storyData[transactionPHIDs]`.
Those transactionPHIDs (or, the transactions they refer to) are the comments in question, one transaction per comment. (So if there's a bunch of inline comments on a revision, for example, that's one story with a number of transactions, one per inline comment and one for the general comment.)

I couldn't find an API method for looking up those transactionPHIDs directly, but if you call `transaction.search` with the `storyData[objectPHID]`, you'll get a list of transactions back, including the transaction(s) in question. These contain the comment text.

So, it doesn't seem like this should be too difficult - just a call to `transaction.search` to look up the comments. I don't have time for it in the foreseeable future though, so if anyone else does... :)",NA,https://api.github.com/repos/etcinit/phabulous/issues/14/comments,https://github.com/etcinit/phabulous/issues/14#issuecomment-336414689,https://api.github.com/repos/etcinit/phabulous/issues/14

However, it might still be a bug in https://github.com/etcinit/gonduit.

I should've mentioned that I'm building pabulous myself, as there are no FreeeBSD builds for download. So it all came down to me not understanding how go works, gonduit and probably some other dependencies were out-of-date while phabulous itself was up-to-date, and it built just fine.

So I rebuilt phabulous after updating gonduit and other dependencies, now it works just fine.

It seems like the bot is failing to fetch the ""More info"" link for messages, which is what the API call for conduit is for. Essentially, the bot requests more info about the PHID mentioned in the story which usually contains a link. Here's what I can think of at the moment:
- A conduit version incompatibility
- A bug in the bot

There's a new version of the bot rewritten in go under the [go](https://github.com/etcinit/phabricator-slack-feed/tree/go) branch. However, I haven't written docs on how to set it up yet.

To start, I took the following part of Lorem ipsum and added it as the description of UIMenuItem:

The word cutted of was labore, so I copied everything from Lorem to labo without the last 2 characters and added them into the Python len function:

```py
>>> x = ""Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labo""
>>> len(x)
97
```

So, 97 characters in total. What about the UTF-8 byte length?

```py

97

`_ADD_TEXT_COMPONENT_STRING` has a limit of 99 bytes per call. In your example, `FormatDescription` inserted 2 newline characters, so it's 97 lorem ipsum characters + 2 newline characters.

So I looked at my log and I noticed that I was calling the BigMessageThread class before the game even loaded. Then I looked through some of the other threads here, and found an answer that someone said about using the Wait method to pause the script before the game loads.

Heres my log file:  

```
[15:57:34] [ERROR] Failed to instantiate script 'TreasurMapGTAV' because constructor threw an exception:
System.InvalidOperationException: Illegal call to 'Script.Wait()' outside main loop!
   at GTA.Script.Wait(Int32 ms)
   at NativeUI.BigMessageHandler.Load()
   at NativeUI.BigMessageHandler.ShowMissionPassedMessage(String msg, Int32 time)
   at TreasurMapGTAV..ctor()
```

So then I said, ""Okay I'll try to use the wait method while the game's loading."", and here's what I have now:

```
while (Game.IsLoading)
        {
            Wait(50);
            return;
        }

        if (e.KeyCode == Keys.B)
        {
            if (!Game.IsLoading)
            {
                BigMessageThread.MessageInstance.ShowMissionPassedMessage(""Treasure Map Successfully loaded!"");
            }
        }
```

I don't know if this is the correct way to do it (I don't think I have to tell it to return if it's already ""waiting""), but this is working. And dude I gotta say it looks really awesome, and just like the vanilla. If I wrote that code wrong please let me know I do really want to learn this, I would love to start developing stuff!

This is from the ScriptHookVDotNet How To's section, as you can see there is a while(!model.IsLoaded) Script.Wait(50); This basically forces the script to wait processing any further until that specific model is available for usage and once it is it spawns the prop in this case. You can do it with vehicles, peds, etc aswell.

* FPS /w menu onscreen, input group 2 only: 65-66 FPS

Turns out the `foreach (var con in Enum.GetValues(typeof(Control)))` in [DisEnableControls](https://github.com/Guad/NativeUI/blob/898b78826171059a27a6963accb450c656beaad3/UIMenu.cs#L236) is responsible for about ~20FPS from the total ~30FPS drop when having the menu open. Not sure how you'd replace this ""block everything"", but removing the 0 and 1 helps a tiny bit. Only disabling a small set of controls would be even better.

Not sure where the 10 FPS drop comes from exactly, as measuring the impact of the string splittage isn't very conclusive.

Edit - 
Replacing that loop with this results in the same behavior, but no FPS drop.
```cs
Function.Call(enable ? Hash.ENABLE_ALL_CONTROL_ACTIONS : Hash.DISABLE_ALL_CONTROL_ACTIONS, 2);
