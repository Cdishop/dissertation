> OpenSSH do not support use publickey and other auth together.

I just wanted to point out that's not actually correct (although it's true for Go's `x/crypto/ssh` server).

In `sshd_config` you can put:

```
AuthenticationMethods publickey,keyboard-interactive:pam
```

and this requires the user to provide both a public key *and* a successful keyboard-interactive challenge.  I use this with `pam_yubico` to require a token login in addition to publickey.

This is documented in the `sshd_config` manpage:

> If the default is overridden, then successful authentication requires completion of every method in at least one of these lists.
>
> For example, ""publickey,password publickey,keyboard-interactive"" would require the user to complete public key authentication, followed by either password or keyboard interactive authentication.

I further tweak this so that logins from the internal network require only publickey, but logins from the Internet require both publickey and token:

```
# Policy for authentication
AuthenticationMethods publickey,keyboard-interactive:pam

# From office and VPN addresses, 2FA not required
Match Address 192.168.0.0/16, 10.0.0.0/8, 2001:db8::/32
AuthenticationMethods publickey

I try to map an user (git) to another server (which is Gitlab), in order to allow git ssh clone, but i have the same issue as [the issue 30](https://github.com/tg123/sshpiper/issues/30). I understand that, in order to avoid MITM, the public key can't be passed directly to the upstream.
But there's a side effect i did not see at first : i created a ""other"" upstream users, which is the fallback user when it's not git. The mapping is very easy : it only remap on localhost, on port 23 for example, where i mapped the original sshd process. It allows to ssh using the current configuration of server when it's not the git user, so it's a quite simple process.
It works perfectly using password, but not with ssh keys : as the ""other"" users did not have a private key, i have the `mapping private key error : no key found ` . I don't think that creating a private/public pair key will work, as ""other"" users can be everyone else than ""git"". Something that can be considered is to pass the public key when it's on localhost ? If you have any others ideas, i'm in :)

When this will be solved, i still will have the same issue as the 30, and i don't know how to bypass it... If you have ideas on this too, it will be awesome.

very cool tool. It works with passwords very well. But I have issues with keys:

```

But when running the following command:

```
ssh -i [KEY] -vvv [IP] -p 2222 -l pantheon-site

I am asked for a password. I have added my ssh key to the `authorized_keys` file on the sshpiper container. The key `/var/sshpiper/pantheon-site/id_rsa` has been added to the `pantheon-site_cli_1_be91bc655ad4` container.

This release changed to use ES Module exports instead of CommonJS exports (webpack-contrib/raw-loader#69). I believe this has caused `angular2-template-loader` to no longer work.

Everything compiles fine, but when you run the Angular application, you get the error:

```
Error: Expected 'styles' to be an array of strings.
```

I think this is because this loader is using `require(...)`, but that's now returning an object with a `default` property that contains a string, rather than just returning a string. I haven't confirmed that though. I wanted to submit this issue while it was still fresh in my mind. When I get some time later on, I'll create a simple repro and investigate a bit further.

The templateUrl and styleUrls fields from the following Component directive aren't recognized:

```JS
@Component({

    ""styleUrls"": [ ""./my-app.component.ts.scss"" ],
    ""templateUrl"": ""./my-app.component.ts.html"",
    ""encapsulation"": ViewEncapsulation.None

However, after removing the double-quotes from the directive, the loader finds the fields correctly:

```JS
@Component({
    selector: ""my-app"",
    styleUrls: [ ""./my-app.component.ts.scss"" ],

This is technically invalid JSON as the standard requires that object keys be strings (double-quoted tokens). I prefer to use syntactically correct JSON in my code to maximize the interoperability in browsers, and I don't like having to dumb it down just because lazily ignoring the standards is pervasive among web developers.

To fix the problem, you should just have to add a quote-balancing group to your regex.

Only finds templateUrls that end with commas, suggesting two things:

That in cases where styleUrls are listed before templateUrls, and templateUrls are the last line of the component metadata, the templateUrl will not match the regex pattern (https://regex101.com/r/PylCUU/2):

```
styleUrls: [..],
templateUrl: '...'
```

And that components with _only_ selectors and templateUrls (namely, no stylesheet), will not match the pattern (https://regex101.com/r/hyzIvz/1) either:

```
templateUrl: '...'
```

Which boils down to essentially the same issue regarding the comma that is required for a templateUrl to be matched, and two scenarios in which that might happen.

I know convention is to have templateUrls before styleUrls, but I don't think it's a hard and fast rule. And while I don't personally subscribe to styleUrls before templateUrls, I feel as though the requirement of a comma is overly strict, and the failure to inline those cases goes pretty quietly, leaving people unwilling or unequipped to dig into why this is happening at a loss to solve the problem.

Panel provides of a lot of components which are then used in Workbench.

`npm link ../panel/dist`) and after that Panel is being found by my bundler (Webpack 2) and its bundled correctly.
Until here everything works fine, the problem comes when the browser loads the Workbench app because it doesn't find the templates of the components provided by the Panel component, it throws a `404 - Error Message`.
Here's a screenshot of the error messages:

As you can see, the `angular2-template-loader` is trying to resolve the templates by going to the src folder of the Workbench app, not the panel app. (`http://127.0.0.1:8080/src/header.component.html`)

Here's how I import the templates and styles of the components of Panel.
```typescript
@Component( {
	selector: ""cp-header"",
	templateUrl: ""./header.component.html"",
	styleUrls: [ ""./header.component.scss"" ],

My understanding of angular2-template-loader is that it basically turns `styleUrls: ['some-file.css']` into  `styles: require('some.file.css')`, which ultimately gets handled by some css loader. 

Is that correct? The reason I'm questioning this is :
1. I tried to swap out`style-loader` with `css-to-string` loader in the config pasted above, but it doesn't seem to work (doesn't autoprefix the css). 
2. The end of the README  says `""The generated require statements"", (for templateUrl and styleUrls), ""will be handled by the given loader for .html and .js files""`.  I would expect that to say ""for .html and .css files"". Does this mean that the styleUrl generates some sort of .js file which _isn't_ handled by a .css loader?

I asked about the setup on the postcss-loader repo (https://github.com/postcss/postcss-loader/issues/113) but they were understandably unfamiliar with this particular loader and how it should integrate with other loaders. Is there anything obviously wrong with my approach or understanding of how this loader works? Thanks!

It works with `ts-loader` or if you set the component as the main entry on webpack (totally useless but might help to find out what's going on).

I tried, by searching around, if there was already a similar issue/thread/question, but it seems not. I also checked for similar spec files in angular2-webpack-starter, but strangely enough none of those was showing the present use case, so maybe it's something known and someone is already working at it. Here's the issue:

a simple AppComponent like those found in quickstart or tour of heroes has an inline `template` and then style is pointed to like `styleUrls: ['./app.component.css'],`. When running a smoke test spec, as soon as we try to configure testing module with component as a _declaration_, test fails because it fails to load CSS file (full stacktrace is appended below, at the end):

```
Failed: Uncaught (in promise): Failed to load app.component.css
resolvePromise@webpack:////path/to/proj/~/zone.js/dist/zone.js:418:0 <- /path/to/proj/src/client/karma-entry.js:11799:76
```

If instead style is manually `require`d as in `styles: [require('./app.component.css')],` the error goes away. This led me here on angular2-template-loader to ask whether it's a known issue or more likely there's something wrong with our setup. 

Environment details and code samples follow: 
- angular 2: 2.0.0 final
- webpack: 1.13.2
- angular2-template-loader: 0.5.0
- karma: 1.3.0

``` ts
// src/client/app/app.component.ts

@Component({
  selector: 'my-app',
  template: `
    <h1>{{title}}</h1>
    <nav>
      <a routerLink=""/dashboard"">Dashboard</a>
      <a routerLink=""/heroes"">Heroes</a>
    </nav>
    <router-outlet></router-outlet>
  `,
  styleUrls: ['./app.component.css'],  // this fails
  //styles: [require('./app.component.css')],  // this does not fail
})
export class AppComponent {
  title = 'Tour of Heroes';
}
```

``` ts
// src/client/app/app.component-decl.spec.ts

describe('AppComponent as declaration', () => {
  beforeEach(async(() => {
    // refine the test module by declaring the test component
    TestBed.configureTestingModule({
      declarations: [ AppComponent ],
    });
    TestBed.compileComponents();
  }));

  it('should complete beforeEach', () => expect(true).toBe(true));
});
```

(there are more errors like that for other components, I replaced them with an ellipsis)

The loader converts the aforementioned source into:

```
import { Component } from ""@angular/core"";

@Component({
    selector: 'app-root',
    template: require('./app/app.component.html')
})
export class AppComponent {
}

```

And now it fails.

As I understand, the reason is that **require** works off the current directory, whereas the **templateUrl** is relative to the root. So, './app/app.component.html' is correct when taken relative to the root, but wrong when relative to the current location.

It is worth noting, that I do not use **require** anywhere in the source code, only the ES6 import statement, which is also relative to the current location. It is only the Angular2 **templateUrl** and **styleUrls** that are relative to the root.

Anyway, I must be doing something wrong, because nobody seems to have my problem. But what am I doing wrong?

The file name is **src/client/app/app.component.ts**. The source code directory structure is:

**Current behavior**
Given the following webpack configuration:

``` typescript
exports.typescriptModule = function() {
  return {
    test: /\.ts$/,
    loaders: ['ts', 'angular2-template-loader']
  }
};
```

``` typescript
{
  test: /\.scss$/,
  include: helpers.root('src'),
  loaders: ['raw', 'sass']
}
```

And this component:

``` typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { ROUTER_DIRECTIVES } from '@angular/router';
import '../../public/css/styles.scss';

@Component({
  selector: 'my-app',
  templateUrl: './app.html',
  styleUrls: ['./app.scss'],
  directives: [ROUTER_DIRECTIVES]
})
export class AppComponent { }
```

Note that templateUrl and styleUrls is used.

When sourcemaps are created it shows the following sourcemap:

``` typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { ROUTER_DIRECTIVES } from '@angular/router';
import '../../public/css/styles.scss';

@Component({
  selector: 'my-app',
  template: require('./app.html'),
  styles: [require('./app.scss')],
  directives: [ROUTER_DIRECTIVES]
})
export class AppComponent { }


/** WEBPACK FOOTER **
 ** ./~/angular2-template-loader!./src/app/app.ts
 **/
```

Note the sourcemap shows template and styles with their require calls, instead of the original source.

**Expected/desired behavior**
Sourcemap should contain the original typescript code.

Lots of examples in the documenation are non-exhaustive and fail with an error (nice job on that error!) (Tested on 0.4.6 and master.)

Worse, it's not clear how to fix the AST examples:

```julia
using MLStyle

ex = quote
    function f(a, b, c)
        a + b + c
    end
end
@match ex begin

        end
    end  => (funcname, arg1, arg2, args, expr)
    _ => error(""That should have worked!"")
end

I've edited this to be exhaustive, but it doesn't match the first pattern. I tried a few more edits and still couldn't get it to work.

I've tried some simple examples and several of them fail for reasons that I don't understand. So perhaps I don't understand how to use this or perhaps it's buggy?

```jl

2. MLStyle as a dev-only dep
    - [x] generating quite readable and concise code
    - [ ] generating julia code requring no runtime support(any `Expr` to julia code library?)

3. more intuitive pattern objects(top-level first-class patterns)
     
    - ~~`pattern_compile(::Type{P}, self::Function, type_params, type_args, args)`~~ `pattern_uncall(::Type{P}, self::Function, type_params, type_args, args)`
    
        Defining ~~`pattern_compile`~~ `pattern_uncall` for type `P` will control the code generation when P is used as a pattern.
        
        `self` is given by our compiler, and `self(::Expr)` will return a pattern.

        Within the following code, pattern syntax `(a, b, c)` will be equivalent to `MyTuplePat(a, b, c)`.
        ```julia
        struct MyTuplePat end
        MLStyle.pattern_uncall(::Type{MyTuplePat}, self, _, _, args) =
            Expr(:tuple, args...) |> self
        
        @match (1, 2, 3) begin
            MyTuplePat(a, b, c) => a + c + b
            _ => error(""anyway"")
        end # => 6
        ```
            
    - `is_enum`

        In the following code, pattern `S` is equivalent to `S()`:

        ```julia
        struct S end
        MLStyle.is_enum(::Type{S}) = true
        
        pattern_uncall(::Type{S}, self, _, _, _) =
            :(::$S) |> self
        
        @match S() begin
            S => 1
        end # => 1
        ```
    
    Above designs deprecate some redundant/non-intuitive things, e.g., [MLStyle Extension List](https://thautwarm.github.io/MLStyle.jl/v0.3.1/syntax/extension/)

4.   new features
    - [x] according to real world practice,  things like `@switch` can be productive:
      ```julia
        @switch val begin
             @case pat1
                  stmt1
                  stmt2
             @case pat2
                  ...
        end
      ```

Breakage&Deprecation
------------------

Before merging this, we shall make sure all of the downstream uses of MLStyle are concerned and well compatible. If not, workaround PRs should be created for fixing the corresponding issues.

Most stuffs can be compatible, except the following ones need attentions:

1. the internal APIs `def_pattern`, `def_app_pattern`, etc., will be removed.
2. [scoping specifiers](https://thautwarm.github.io/MLStyle.jl/v0.3.1/syntax/qualifier/) for data type definitions: `@data public`, `@data internal`, etc., will be deprecated as they now just do nothing.
   The new visibility is the same as julia scopes, i.e, an object implements `pattern_compile` is visible in current module, you can use it as a pattern when matching.
3. defining view patterns(active patterns) doesn't need `@active` macro.  Using `@active`  to define view patterns will be deprecated, and note that the view patterns defined by `@active` cannot be statically generated, i.e., if you use `@active`, you cannot use MLStyle as a dev-only dependency.

What I want to do is that the user can specify a search => replace pattern, e.g.

sin($x) => cos($x + 1)
```

And then I would go over the whole AST of the file and replace each expression matching `sin($x)` with `cos($x + 1)`.

```julia
@match $ex begin

This PR is meant to be a work in progress where I correct some grammar and add more simple examples so that more julia users can tell what this package is good for. 

I'm still trying to understand the documentation on algebraic data types. For instance, when you write 
```julia
@data internal A begin
    A1(Int, Int)
    A2(a :: Int, b :: Int)
    A3(a, b) # equals to `A3(a::Any, b::Any)`
end
```
there's no explanation of what this means. After some playing around, I see that it is more or less equivalent to 
```julia
abstract type A end
struct A1 <: A
    _1::Int
    _2::Int
end
struct A2 <: A
    a::Int
    b::Int
end
struct A3 <: A
    a
    b
end
```
Are there any other differences?

What confuses me more is 
```julia
@data visible in MyModule C{T} begin
    C1(T)

There's a sort of ""design pattern"" I see you using that I'd like to better understand.

Macros interpret their arguments as expressions, so `@foo x` will try to do manipulations on the `x` as a _symbol_, ignoring any value `x` is bound to.

For things like `match`, you somehow pass an _expression_, and any non-expression gets looked up in the current local context. This seems to me a much better use of macros (or at least better suited to my use case).

```julia
d = [(i, i + 1) for i = 1:5]
@match d begin
   [(i, i + 1) for i in seq] => seq
end # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

Which is to say, `(i, i + 1)` matches the element of `d`, thus we can do a **reversed comprehension**, where `for i in seq` produces a `[i for (i, i+1) in d]`.  

As a result,
```julia
d = [(i, i + 1) for i = 1:5]
@match d begin
   [i for i in seq] => seq
end # [(1, 1 + 1), (2, 2+1), (3, 3+1), (4, 4+1), (5, 5+1)]

```julia
x :: Vector{Tuple{String, Term}}
eval_term :: Term => Expr

@active Eval(x) begin
    eval_term(x)
end

@match x begin

There is a problem that QuoteNode would be automatically evaluated, so when source ast contains QuoteNode, pattern matching compilation generates the same QuoteNode and inserts it into the generated ast. The QuoteNode generated by pattern compilation would then be auto evaluated and finally we got a `a != QuoteNode(a)`, in another words, matching fails.

To solve this problem we introduce a `QuotePattern` to avoid auto evaluation of QuoteNode generated by patterns.

Following the knowledge given by the the first referenced issue, this technically works.

This is an automated pull request by @mortenpi._

The next [Documenter.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl) release (0.20) will make breaking changes to the `makedocs` and `deploydocs` functions. This PR makes sure that your Travis CI runs will install and use Documenter 0.19, so that documentation deployment would not break when 0.20 is released.

Subscribe to JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl#861 to be notified about the 0.20 release. The release will come with release notes detailing how to upgrade your `make.jl` script. Note that the conversation in that issue is locked, so you should not receive any other notifications from there.

The two properties linked above, ""type"" and ""version"" are included in the IConnectionTask interface. These properties seem to be on the wrong file though I might be missing something .

The IConnectionTask interface is used to populate the ""input"" object that are intended to hold task parameters.

The actual ""task"" object has the ""name"" and ""version"" properties that can be used to determine what task input should be de-serialized. The ""task"" and ""version"" properties have no guarantee to be on the input object at all. 

Am I missing something here about these properties being included when tasks are invoked? Its definitely possible that I missed this in the documentation somewhere.

This approach is more internal code, but less for our users. So if we decided to leave things as they were - we'd end up with this code to turn on caching

```csharp
RequestVerification.CertificateHandler = new CachedCertificateHandler()
```

and if we changed to Cached by default you give CertificateHandler the cache as a default value, and it's a one liner to change it back

`  
The Problem is not the NuGet Alexa.NET because i can update the old ASP .NET Core app to 1.12.0 and it works. 

I use the default template and changed nothing. Here is the Startup.cs (old and new)

Old 2.1 Version
` public class Startup
    {
        public Startup(IConfiguration configuration)
        {
            Configuration = configuration;
        }

        public IConfiguration Configuration { get; }

        // This method gets called by the runtime. Use this method to add services to the container.
        public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
        {
            services.AddMvc().SetCompatibilityVersion(CompatibilityVersion.Version_2_1);
        }

        // This method gets called by the runtime. Use this method to configure the HTTP request pipeline.
        public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IHostingEnvironment env)
        {
            if (env.IsDevelopment())
            {
                app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
            }

            app.UseMvc();
        }
    }`

New 3.1 Version
`public class Startup
    {
        public Startup(IConfiguration configuration)
        {
            Configuration = configuration;
        }

        public IConfiguration Configuration { get; }

        // This method gets called by the runtime. Use this method to add services to the container.
        public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
        {
            services.AddControllers();
        }

        // This method gets called by the runtime. Use this method to configure the HTTP request pipeline.
        public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
        {
            if (env.IsDevelopment())
            {
                app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
            }

            app.UseRouting();

            app.UseAuthorization();

            app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
            {
                endpoints.MapControllers();
            });
        }
    }`

My Controller is very very very simple to test the Deserialization 

`    [Route(""[controller]"")]
    [ApiController]
    public class DefaultController : ControllerBase
    {
        [HttpGet]
        public string Test()
        {
            return ""Erfolgreich!"";
        }

        [HttpPost]
        public SkillResponse HandleResponse([FromBody]SkillRequest input)
        {
            return ResponseBuilder.Tell(""OK"", null);
        }
    }`

It looks like it is a problem of System.Text.Json withcn replace Newtonsoft in .NET CORE 3.0.
What can i do?

IT does this by introducing IEndSessionDirective as an inherited interface of IDirective (which has the JsonIgnore attribute - this doesn't affect serialization).

The example is the VideoAppDirective - where ShouldEndSession has to be null (otherwise the skill will error on the device).

The code checks if all directives with overrides have the same value - if they do - that value is returned

If there's no override, or the directives conflict about what the override should be, it reverts to the explicit value set against the response (did think about throwing an exception - but realistically in a situation where conflicting values is required - there will probably be a workaround by the team that says what the setting should be)

The issue is they're doing this through the `Connections.SendRequest` Directive and `Connections.Response` Request - which are already used by In Skill Purchasing.

Technical Documentation on directive and request: https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/smapi/voice-permissions-for-reminders.html#send-a-connectionssendrequest-directive

To ensure that this can be handled moving forward I've had to update the request and directive converters to handle the scenario where the type of request isn't enough to correctly identify the type needing to be deserialized.

Instead - the type leads to a converter, and the converter then has a number of handlers that examine the JSON and decide if they can handle them.

I've added base classes that allow this to be extensible relatively painlessly (I know what I'm going to need to update the In Skill Purchasing decision)

Also - these requests also use the connection status information previously seen as part of the Skill Task integration, so I've moved `TaskStatus` into the root and renamed it `ConnectionStatus` to avoid unnecessary duplication - I feel it's the right refactor, but it does move this change from a minor to a major as it will break any explicit typing of TaskStatus.",NA,TRUE,https://api.github.com/repos/timheuer/alexa-skills-dotnet,https://api.github.com/repos/timheuer/alexa-skills-dotnet/issues/187/labels{/name},https://api.github.com/repos/timheuer/alexa-skills-dotnet/issues/187/comments,https://api.github.com/repos/timheuer/alexa-skills-dotnet/issues/187/events,https://github.com/timheuer/alexa-skills-dotnet/pull/187,https://api.github.com/repos/timheuer/alexa-skills-dotnet/pulls/187

I found this by chance while writing some ""integration"" tests for an Alexa skill of my own where I'd forgotten to set the value before passing serializing the request to pass into the function. This then meant that the deserializer threw an exception before invoking the function handler.

Please be free to say this is a .NET issue, but with latest VS 16.3.2 and updated Nuget packages for Alexa.NET and Azure functions 1 and 2 I get ""SessionEndedRequest"" with error ""INVALID_RESPONSE"" ""SpeechletResponse was null""... but ONLY with Azure Functions 1 (.NET Framework).

This used to work and I have too many variables changed to tie it down but basically, a Azure Functions 2 removes the NULLS from the response in the code below, but the Azure Function 1 maintains the NULLS e.g. image below extract from NGrok (open it to see full content)

If I use the commented out code, to remove NULLs and pass as a string of json all is fine with Amazon. Or somehow in Azure Functions 2 (.net core) that happens anyway.

A functionality consumer uses a start connection directive to trigger the process, this has a ""task"" added to it (A payload of input parameters).

This manifests as a new Task property in the Launch Request (optional) to the provider of the functionality. They do what's needed then send a Task Complete Directive to represent the end of their part

The original skill receives a SessionResumedRequest to pick up where they left off.

To the user it's all seamless. There are five supported connections out the box - developers can create others through skill management (The converter mechanism I've added can be easily added to, and is based on an interface they can use to extend it).

E.g.

Step 1 - Ask for slot 1.
Step 2- Do some processing on slot 1, add a session attribute to track data and ask for slot 2
Step 3 - Do more processing with data I have, remove the previous session attribute as I do not need it, send some response to user, and ask for slot 3.

I don't end my response and have a session open for other intents too. So do not want intermediate session attributes to hang on till the session ends.

I add session attributes via the response.sessionattributes, but I not sure how do I remove a session attribute that I got via the request?

I'm trying to use the RequestVerification.Verify() method in the following way:

```
public async static Task<IActionResult> Run(

   {
        log.LogInformation(""Function triggered"");
        Uri signatureCertChainUrl = new Uri(request.Headers[""SignatureCertChainUrl""]);
        string signature = request.Headers[""Signature""];

        string json = await request.ReadAsStringAsync();

        bool isValid = await RequestVerification.Verify(signature, signatureCertChainUrl, json);

        if (isValid)
        {

        else
        {
            return new BadRequestResult();
        }
    }
```

Of course this is just a simplification. My real method doesn't simply return OkResult, but it contains all the code to interact with the user using voice commands.

The problem is that the Verify() method always raises the following exception:

> System.Net.Http: The requested name is valid, but no data of the requested type was found. System.Private.CoreLib: The requested name is valid, but no data of the requested type was found

If I try to verify just the signatureCertChainUrl it works, but it seems to not be enough for Amazon since the technical validation phase of the submission always fails.

Can you help?

I'm currently working on a separate package to support this API, but obviously using Alexa.NET as the core. The issue is there's one situation in the documentation Alexa.NET does not currently allow support for.

Currently the ""shouldEndSession"" property in the response object is set to false or true dependent on whether or not Alexa needs to listen for a response or not. With the Gadget API there is a third option - which is that the session requires no voice, but should remain open for Gadget input (such as pressing an Echo Button).

According to the documentation - this should be handled by not rendering the shouldEndSession property at all. This PR adjusts the ShouldEndSession property from a bool to a bool? with a default value of false, and null handling to ignore the property if it's null.

This allows for existing behavior to continue correctly (implicit conversions handle that, all current tests pass). But also ensures that the objects can be used for this new purpose as well.

I'd really appreciate if this could be merged in, maybe as pre-release seeing as the Gadget API isn't public yet? That way we could be ready to support the new functionality in .NET Core when it does.

Allowing you ( or Alexa through delegation ) to step through the creation of a full intent request one slot at a time.

This means that potentially intent slots can be filled in through server side calculations without every step having to be performed - or you're able to confirm data to ensure the intent is filled in correctly.

This Pull Request adds support for the necessary objects to ensure Dialogs can be used with Alexa.NET

**Additional Directives**
Four new Directives have been added ( with appropriate tests based on documentation examples and helper methods in ResponseBuilder ):
DialogDelegate
DialogElicitSlot
DialogConfirmSlot
DialogConfirmIntent

**New Properties**
To support the ability for a dialogue to confirm the state of an intent, ConfirmationStatus has been added to both the Intent and Slot objects, as well as helper objects containing the expected states.

**Change in Namespaces**
As intents and slots can be now be sent back to Alexa - updated within the UpdatedIntent property of a dialog directive, the Intent and Slot objects have been moved to the primary Alexa.NET namespace; They are neither request nor response specifically - but can be used both ways in a two-way conversation. Keeping them in Request would be a smaller change, but it would mean that response directives would have to reference request objects which seemed even more confusing than updating the namespace.

The Standard Built-In intents such as AMAZON.CancelIntent are incredibly useful for a more fully developed skill, but there are now more powerful Intents being offered as standard where full objects are being mapped to slot values and accessed through a rich set of utterances already available within Alexa. 

The following example is taken from [The CreativeWork category](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/docs/built-in-intent-ref/creativework-intents)

     User: show me the name of this program
     Intent: AMAZON.SearchAction<object@CreativeWork[name]>

These intents are bound by a signature format, which splits them into Namespace, Action and a flexible set of entity & property combinations.

It's these properties that mean the intents can't just be string compared to dictate processing - your SearchAction code in the earlier example is probably going to be the same in terms of filtering - but knowing the user only asked for the name gives you a little more detail that means you can refine your response before sending it back out. The new object allows for simpler filtering by separating the signature into its component parts.

The changes in this PR alters the Name property of the intent to an IntentName object which parses the string into these parts, as well as keeping the original string as a FullName property.

The object has an implicit operator with string and FullName is used with custom equality methods to ensure parsing requires no additional complexity outside of the new object and existing code performing string comparison requires as few changes as possible (hopefully none in almost all cases)

The code used for parsing checks for markers in the signature that indicate more complex names so extra steps are only run when required.

There's an extra example JSON (BuiltInIntentRequest.json) that shows the kind of power this can give a skills developer. The hope is that future changes will be able to add more helper methods and typed constants to allow easier comparison of this library.

I needed support for this in my Lamda function, so I used your repo as a starting point.
In case you're planned on adding this, feel free to merge or to close, depdending on your need, just wanted to give you the option.

I also did a small refactoring of the BundleRequest. Instead of adding just another interface, I created a factory JsonConverter which creates Request instances based on the type (see Types/RequestConverter.cs)

Please describe.**
Most languages treat quotes like brackets, but this extension misses this for some reason.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Brackets do a lot of cool things. When I type `{`, I get another `}`, and if I type `}` again, it just steps over the other one. Also, when I highlight a block of code and hit `{`, it surrounds it with brackets. This is true for square and round brackets too. I'm sure you know this.

I expected the same behavior with strings and quotes, like many languages. When I type `""`, it doesn't add another quote, but I think it'll be very useful to have this.

I was trying to run a small test sketch through Visual Studio Code and nothing happened.
After about half an hour of trying to add/re-add/change the Environment Path and the tasks.json, I finally decided to try and run the sketch in Processing and noticed a small typo `backgrounnd` instead of `background` and sure enough after fixing that typo everything started to work as expected!

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Make a typo
2. Run processing project

**Expected behavior**
Some kind of indication that the sketch contains an error would be great!
I'm not sure how much you are able to do, but something as simple as the red squiggles under something that is wrong would be a great improvement.

I am not too sure if this is related to the extension itself, or more a Visual Studio Code thing.

In the Processing IDE, it was possible to Ctrl+Click a piece of code and if that was in another file, it would open that file in its tab. Is that possible in Visual Studio Code when doing Processing?

I know that Processing is based on java so I tried my luck with using [Google Java Format](https://github.com/google/google-java-format) with the [Google Java Format Provider](https://github.com/wx-chevalier/vscode-google-java-format-provider) extension for VS Code as my default formatter for .pde files, but I couldn't get it to work.

I'd love it if this extension supported auto formatting. I know it's a lot of work, but I'd be glad to help. The thing is I've never contributed to an existing project on Github so I'm a little bit lost and don't really know where to start.
Moreover, since [Google Java Format](https://github.com/google/google-java-format) is an open-source project, I think it could be used as a starting point if we were to implement formatting to this extension.

Firstly, there is no keyboard shortcut for selecting either 'Terminate Task' or 'Restart Task', so you'd still have to use the mouse to choose either option.

Even if you restart/terminate the task, it will terminate the previous task, and potentially restart it again. This builds a new version of the sketch and runs it.

However, the previous Processing sketch will still be open. So you'll now be looking at two sketches, one old, one new.

Currently I have to close the processing sketch by first switching from vscode to the window, and then closing it, then switch back to vscode and `CTRL+SHIFT+B` again.

Is it possible to set it up in such a way that you could just press `CTRL+SHIFT+B` again and have it close your previous sketch and build and launch a new one?

I could set up something like a globally active AHK script that terminates the process with my sketches name whenever I press `CTRL+SHIFT+B`, but I can see that causing some potential issues as well.

Your help is much appreciated!

Some users are having issues with Windows using Bash. It's likely some kind of file name/directory path issue?

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Ideally, I'd want Processing to run in the shell of the user's choice. But I guess since there is syntax differences between cmd and bash that may be causing an issue?

Some users have fixed themselves. Maybe rather than changing the task file, can update the readme for users to tweak themselves if its an issue?

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
If I had the time I'd try to test out these cases and explore why bash may be failing, and see if I can make the script more robust to work regardless of shell used (rather than forcing it to summon cmd.exe)

I can't build projects through extension's command `processing.RunTaskFile`. Each time I try to run it, no integrated terminal shows up, therefore no output appears.
This may be caused by the fact that the Terminal doesn't gets called by the extension.

The issue appears for both `println()` and `System.out.println()` methods.


**To Reproduce the issue**
Create a simple *.pde file with the following content:
```java
void setup() {
  size(400, 400);
  println(""This is a correct syntax highlight"");
  if (10 = 10) { 
    println(""This is a correct syntax highlight"");
  }
  println(""This is a INCORRECT syntax highlight"");
}
```

then, to see even more different coloring behavior, change the content to the following
```java
println(""This is a INCORRECT syntax highlight"");
if (10 = 10) { 
  println(""This is a correct syntax highlight"");
}
println(""This is a INCORRECT syntax highlight"");
```

**Expected behavior**
Words are highlighted with varied colors which are different from the plain color used for highlighting the strings in other places. In my case, some words are purple and red instead of plain green.

**Possible reason**
It seems that the behavior depends on the number of curly braces placed above the mentioned text.

Note that `${workspaceRoot}` is changed to `${fileDirname}`.
I made a workspace of the processing examples folder for example:

<img width=""383"" alt=""screen shot 2017-08-08 at 16 28 34"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/738650/29076750-af113ada-7c56-11e7-9426-581310e16b2d.png"">

Now I can just run any example I want without creating a task.json for each example.
I also removed the `""--output=${workspaceRoot}\\out""`, It is not needed to run and I prefer to not have those files created in a temp directory instead of in the directory of the pde. I think it would be good to remove this by default.

O yeah, on a mac `""--output=${workspaceRoot}\\out""` doesn't work anyway. It has to be:
`""--output=${workspaceRoot}/out""` in order to make it work.

      ""editor.wordHighlightStrongBorder"": ""#399ef4"",
      ""editor.wordHighlightBackground"": ""#0000"",
      ""editor.wordHighlightBorder"": ""#399ef4"",
      ""editor.selectionHighlightBackground"": ""#399ef440"",
      ""editor.selectionBackground"": ""#399ef480""
```

This moves word highlight to the border and makes strong (definition) the same as normal (reference). Additionally it makes selection brighter than selection highlight, I'm not sure why it was like this, I may have changed it to give contrast in some case which inverted them.

I've posted it anyway, so that others might use the bypass solution described here or can help to get a better solution.

### Issue of using sphinx stand alone and in combination with tinkerer
Tinkerer 1.7.2 has Sphinx 1.7.1 as requirement. The latest Sphinx is 3.1.2 (July 2020) and I'm also Sphinx as standalone (without tinkerer) and would like to use the latest version. When I first install sphinx:

`pip install sphinx`

I get version 3.1.2, but when I also install tinkerer:

`pip install tinkerer`

The output mentions that sphinx is downgraded to version 1.7.1 due to tinkerer requirements. 

### Considered but not chosen solutions
A [python virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) cannot handle this as it can only handle different python versions, e.g. 3.7 and 3.8, but not different module versions. I've also considered [pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en) and [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/), but these require configuration files and seems to be more oriented towards developers and I wanted something more simple. A virtual machine like [virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) seems to be too much overload.

### Chosen solution
The chosen solution uses [pipx](https://pypi.org/project/pipx/) and is described here. 

First remove tinkerer and sphinx from your installation:

```
pip uninstall sphinx
pip uninstall tinkerer

```
I'm using (K)ubuntu with the aptitude package manager and installed pipx via:

```
sudo aptitude -y install pipx
pipx ensurepath
```

Without `aptitude`, you might want to use `apt` or `apt-get`. Pipx can be installed in many other ways, see: [pipx](https://pypi.org/project/pipx/) . 

When I tried tinkerer this way to generate my website, I got error messages, and I found out Tinkerer calls Sphinx via a subprocess (instead of 'within' python), Hence, it breaks out of the pipx virtual python environment... This can be prevented by editing the file (using the nano editor):

`nano ~/.local/pipx/venvs/tinkerer/lib/python3.8/site-packages/tinkerer/cmdline.py`

and change line 49 from `flags = [""sphinx-build""]` to:

`flags = [""~/.local/pipx/venvs/tinkerer/bin/sphinx-build""]`

When you want to use additional modules, you also have to add them in pipx, as for example to add matplotlib:

 `pipx inject tinkerer requests matplotlib`

I also made some changes to the conf.py file, perhaps not needed... but anyway:

- tinkerer imports at the beginning are commented out... they are already loaded elsewhere, hence not needed
- all references to tinkerer _themes and _static are removed... as I use self defined, locally stored _themes and _static
- some variables are hard-coded instead of referring to tinkerer settings as in:

```
source_suffix = "".rst""
master_doc = ""master""
```
Now tinkerer generates my website fluently, using sphinx 1.7.1

I can now also install sphinx latest version:

`pip install --upgrade sphinx`

which gives me version 3.1.2. And this runs well

This is good.

In any narrow window, sidebar entries (other pages on site) flow to the top of the page, and all are visible. This is good.

But if a window wide enough for the menu to stay at the left gets shrunk vertically to half the height of the screen or so, only part of the sidebar is visible. If the site has several pages, those at the bottom of the list are not displayed. **There appears to be no way to force links to pages at the end of the list to show up** -- mousing over the sidebar and moving the scroll wheel doesn't move them either. This makes Tinkerer sites hard to use for people who can't, don't want to, or don't know to resize their window narrow enough to force the sidebar entries to flow to the top.

Here's my Tinkerer site in a normal window (top) compared to a wide-but-short window (bottom):

Correct behavior would be anything that allows a user to access an arbitrarily long list of pages in the sidebar in a wide-but-short window. The simplest thing to do would probably be to make it so that scrolling on the list causes it to move, but I don't currently have sufficient web dev knowledge to implement that.

Simple 1 liner change, if the environment variable `TINKERER_BLOG_PATH` is set, use it, else default to `blog`.

Useful for me as I can't use the command line without overwriting older posts already in the `blog` directory (from another blog).

The issue is I already have my rst docs in a folder called `blog`, now everytime I run `tinker --build` it deletes all of theme for the build (I have them in a repo but could be dangerous for other newcomers).

I want the url's to be like `/blog/2016/01/01/post.html` - so want them within a blog subdir.
Has anyone else done this? - Any extensions or better hacks then what i've done below?

For others, if this is an issue, I just disabled the `tinker` command line script permanently (to prevent me from accidently running it) - Then just use a makefile like sphinx to build where you want it.

``` bash
# Open the tinker script /usr/local/bin/tinker
$ vi `which tinker`
```

``` python
# Just exit whenever it's run
print ""Disabled due to overwriting of blog directory""
print ""view: http://tinkerer.me/pages/documentation.html""
exit()
```

Obviously not a full time solution, but prevents me from accidently running it and deleting my posts.

Would be great to have this configurable, it would be nice to use the `_build` directory (like sphinx does) by default.

I've tried using rst syntax, and also inserting raw html, and even thrown it the `\n` control character to see what would happen, but none of these attempts have worked. 

2)  If it's currently impossible to get basic formatting in taglines, is this a feature that you'd like to have in Tinkerer eventually? As a Tinkerer user, I would personally like to have more flexibility in formatting my blog's tagline, but I understand that you as a developer might have some compelling reason why it would be problematic.

3)  If you would like tagline formatting to be implemented, would it be better to have the tagline string rendered from reStructuredText, or injected as raw HTML?

Thanks!

This method is locale-aware and formats dates according to the current environment locale, that is, the value of `$LANG` or `$LC_*`.

Hence, formatting of dates in posts depends on the environment in which Tinkerer is run, and **ignores** the `language` setting in `conf.py`.  

To build an English language blog on a system with, say, a German locale, you currently need to set `LANG` to `en_US.utf8` explicitly (or a similar English-language locale) to make the post dates appear in English.  Otherwise they will be German, i.e. `Januar 1, 2013` instead of `January 1, 2013`.

Found the reason by accident when editing a post:
.. tags:: TagA, TagB, TagC,
There was a comma too mush. I dunno if we want to check for empty tags and then skip them?

I figured that could be the issue. Yeah, we probably want to add a check for empty tags.

O.K. thank you, this bug has very low priority but it is a good idea to leave it open, just as a reminder that there is something that could be improved. We could also print a warning and the filename where the empty tag/category comes from like Sphinx does for syntax errors and bad formatted tables.
Mark as spam  Delete  2013-02-17
Vlad Riscutia
I completely agree. It is a legitimate issue and Tinkerer should, at the least, treat empty tag like it treats 'none' string. Printing a warning would be even better. Will look at if after next release.

I can confirm this issue.
Workaround is to manually edit the heading inside the file, since these chars are not slug friendly anyway.

I've added a fix here: https://bitbucket.org/christianjann/tinkerer/commits/5f29318e338f4d5d88d89da28d1c9d6b7b80c9fa.
A solution that will also work with python 3:

import sys

elif command.post:
-   if sys.version_info < (3,):
-       command.post[0] = command.post[0].decode(sys.stdin.encoding) #.decode('utf8')
  create_post(command.post[0], post_date, command.quiet, command.filename)

  Another way to handle the slugs is to pipe them through the translit module:
  http://pypi.python.org/pypi/translit/0.2a1

This way you can automatically make ASCII-only slugs for filenames.

Thanks! translit looks great, though this is Python3 only. I can probably merge the two fixes so it works on both version. I'll give it a shot after the next release.

The autoscaler should ignore unschedulable nodes when calculating the cluster's capacity IMO.

Reproduction Steps

1. Deploy Cluster (1 master, 1 node)

```sh
az group deployment create --name ""acs-default"" \
                           --resource-group ""acs-default"" \
                           --template-file ""./_output/k8s-acs-default/azuredeploy.json"" \
                           --parameters ""./_output/k8s-acs-default/azuredeploy.parameters.json""
```

2. Deploy Hadoop (enough to fit on 1 node)

```sh
helm install --name hadoop -f values.yaml . --namespace hadoop
```

3. Deploy ACS Auto Scaler (already filled proper values)

```sh
helm install --name acs-engine-autoscaler  -f values.yaml .
```

4. RBAC Quick Fix

```sh
kubectl create clusterrolebinding serviceaccounts-cluster-admin --clusterrole=cluster-admin --group=system:serviceaccounts
```

4. ACS Auto Scaler logs before increase Hadoop specs

```sh
kubectl logs $(kubectl --namespace=default get pods -l ""app=acs-engine-autoscaler"" -o jsonpath=""{.items[0].metadata.name}"")
```

This is my (redacted) values.yaml:

I've tried also adding `etcdClientPrivateKey` and `etcdServerPrivateKey` but this doesn't seem to help. Any idea what i'm doing wrong?

When attempting to scale up the kubernetes cluster the scaling doesn't occur. From the logs the apparent error has to do with the **etcdPeerPrivateKey0** missing. I do not see a config parameter or environment variable available to push this value into.

The most interesting line there is probably `2018-02-12 22:05:19,137 - autoscaler.cluster - ERROR - Azure Error: InvalidDeploymentParameterValue
Message: The value of deployment parameter 'etcdPeerPrivateKey0' is null. Please specify the value or use the parameter reference. See https://aka.ms/arm-deploy/#parameter-file for details.` but I included the rest for the sake of context. The azure deployment indeed has a blank value for **etcPeerPrivateKey0** but that is the same story for all of the other key parameters (etcdserver, etcdclient, etc).

**Versions**:
Kubernetes version 1.9.2
ACS-Engine version 0.12.5
kubernetes-acs-engine-autoscaler latest

**Additional Details**:

I did not use HELM to create my deployment but rolled my own secret file and then created a deployment file from the sample provided at the root of the repo.

Don't stress that the secret itself is slightly different. I'm currently prototyping both cluster-autoscaler from kubernetes and this autoscaler. They share the same secrets so the naming will be slightly different from the example.

If I delete the failed resources manually and wait for the next scaling events, the nodes scale just fine. The next time the cluster has to scale in and back out - those nodes fail again.

Another interesting pattern is that the same nodes fail every time, while others are created successfully (in my case it's nodes number 1,3,4 - while every other node is created successfully)

What can be the cause of this strange issue? 
What is the difference between removing the VM, NIC and osdisk manually using the azure UI and the way the autoscaler performs these steps? From looking into the code and checking the azure python SDK I've expected the operations to be identical.

We feel it happens because of a bug in the autoscaler comparing k8s metrics with the responses coming from the azure-sdk, but only the k8s data is being logged. I would like to add more debug logging, mostly the acs-deployment being requested, the pool size it wishes to change to etc.

Alternatively, we could load templates from external file. That would allow for maximum drain of resources (especially if you have a few agent pools with expensive VMs).

This is not a bug, sorry I didn't find a better way to communicate this!

I have been using the autoscaler and it's working great, but it's somewhat slow, for us adding new nodes is taking approximately 10 minutes. 

Maybe our use case is a bit special but we have usually very small load that sometimes go up very fast, the specific service I am speaking about acts as a precomputed cache.
If the cache is full, hits are very cheap, if the cache is purged, something that happens 2 or 3 times per week, the load skyrocket for about 2 to 3 hours. 

I understand that creating the nodes, installing everything and adding them to the cluster is something that takes its time, but I have been thinking, why not having a specific number of pre-configured nodes, only deallocated, it would be much faster to just put online existing servers that destroy them and recreate them from the very beginning every time, no?

We used  the method described on https://github.com/Azure/acs-engine/issues/621 to add an agent pool.
We also tested the autoscaler to “manually” upscale a specific pool (after the upscale completed we switched to –dry-run mode) on another cluster.
It will be useful for us to combine the ‘autoscaler’ with the ability to add agent pool when required.

Right now all the load could be handled by 2 nodes like autoscaler correctly detects, but it doesn't cordon and drain the unneeded nodes. I just tried to do it manually myself:
```
$ kubectl cordon k8s-agentpool1-42737137-4
node ""k8s-agentpool1-42737137-4"" cordoned

$ kubectl drain k8s-agentpool1-42737137-4
node ""k8s-agentpool1-42737137-4"" already cordoned
error: DaemonSet-managed pods (use --ignore-daemonsets to ignore): kube-proxy-hcfkz

$ kubectl drain --ignore-daemonsets k8s-agentpool1-42737137-4
node ""k8s-agentpool1-42737137-4"" already cordoned
WARNING: Ignoring DaemonSet-managed pods: kube-proxy-hcfkz
pod ""calling-eagle-acs-engine-autoscaler-2908112416-p9vg5"" evicted
node ""k8s-agentpool1-42737137-4"" drained
```
is the reason for that ""under-utilized-undrainable"" that the nodes had running the kube-proxy daemonset? Thanks!

I configured slack webhook and bot token, but I don't get notifications for scaling actions.
I read the code and it seems like it shouldn't work. I couldn't find any reference to `notify_scale`.
What do I miss?

Thanks

We have two agent pools, let's call them pool1 and pool2.
I configured `--spare-agents 2` which should make sure that there are at least four agents, two for each pool.

We have two agent pools, let's call them pool1 and pool2.
I have a pod with `nodeSelector: {agentpool: pool2}`. The autoscaler removed the nodes of pool2. Now the log of the autoscaler says `KubePod(default, some-pod-name) fits on k8s-pool1-12212174-0`. This will not work since that specific pod can't run on this specific node due to the nodeSelector configuration.

Here's the scenario:

* There are 2 nodes in the autoscaling pool and once the `grace-period` is over, one of them is marked `under-utilized-drainable` and another is marked `under-utilized-undrainable` as expected. However, pretty quickly both are transitioned to `under-utilized-drainable` instead of the latter transitioning to `spare-agent`.

I love the functionality of this tslint-loader. But I wonder about the performance. My angular project takes ~15sec to build in the dev-server, even if I do not change a single file and just force it by saving a random file.

I tried to cache as much as possible, e.g. I turned on useCache and useBabel with awesome-typescript-loader, but it has almost no effect.

When I remove ts-lint from my loader settings, the performance is increased to 4sec. Still a little bit slow, but I can live with that.

For the most part it works really well, and has boosted my productivity substantially. I am having a problem, and would definitely appreciate your input in trying to figure out a fix/workaround, or guidance in the case I may be doing something wrong.

I have an npm package (A) that hosts an app that is bundled via webpack. When adding `tslint-loader` to my webpack builds, it works nicely.

Separately, I have a library as an npm package (B) that A consumes. Oftentimes, I may do development with both of them at the same time. I will use `npm link` to create a symlink between B and its independency inside A's node_modules folder. This workflow does not work for `tslint-loader`, as I get the following error:

```bash

The error doesn't happen if I run the tslint command directly, i.e.

The idea is to allow users to customize options on `failOnHint` to take into account the severity of the rules. For instance, rules whose severity is `warning` shouldn't break the build process. For instance:
```json
rules: {
  ""no-console"": { ""severity"": ""warning"" },
}
```
This PR allows `failOnHint` property to be an object that accepts these optional properties:
```javascript
          failOnHint: {
            ignoreWarnings: true,
            displayWarnings: true,
            silent: true,
          }
```
When `ignoreWarnings` is set to true, when there are only warnings, they are ignored and the compilation succeeds. However, if there is at least one error, both errors and warnings are shown and the compilation fails (this way doesn't break existing configuration)

When `displayWarnings` is set to true, compilation succeeds but warnings are shown (`webpackInstance.emitWarning`)

`silent` doesn't throw an error only displays error output (`webpackInstance.emitError`). It's useful together with `emitErrors: true` and `webpack.NoEmitOnErrorsPlugin` webpack plugin. We can get a nice and clean output by combining these, specially with the plugin.

The `vue-loader` API only supports using a string to specify the loader, as in the following:

  loader: 'vue-loader',
  options: {
    loaders: {

  if (semver.satisfies(Lint.Linter.VERSION, '>=5.0.0')) {      
    Lint.Configuration.parseConfigFile(options.configuration);
  }

  return options.configuration;
}
```
My version of tslint is 5.4.0 and I am using a tslint.json located at my root which looks like this:
```
{
  ""extends"": [
    ""tslint:recommended""
  ],
  ""rules"": {    
  }
}
```

Therefore the code will use Lint.Configuration.parseConfigFile to parse the config file. The problem is that in tslint (at least in 5.4.0) parseConfigFile does not traverse and resolve any of the rules provided via the ""extends"" option. I was able to fix this by using Lint.Configuration.loadConfigurationFromPath; the changed code looks like this:
```
function parseConfigFile(webpackInstance, configFile, options) {
  if (!options.configuration) {
    return Lint.Linter.findConfiguration(configFile, webpackInstance.resourcePath).results;
  }

  if (semver.satisfies(Lint.Linter.VERSION, '>=5.0.0')) {      
    return Lint.Configuration.loadConfigurationFromPath(configFile,configFile);
  }

  return options.configuration;
}
```
Using the above fix everything appears to work properly. Also worth mentioning is that in the *tslint* codebase parseConfigFile is only use internally by loadConfigurationFromPath...

Three questions:
1. Has nobody else run into this issue??
2. Am I completely doing something wrong or crazy...?
3. If not, should I do a pull request...?

I have a webpack 1.13.1 configuration that I try to convert to webpack 2.1.0-beta.25 configuration.

the preLoaders related configuration, I changed to loaders configuration with 'pre' set for enforce.
what I get left is the tslint configuration part.

now when I try to build the webpack project with 'npm run build' I get 

For loader options: webpack 2 no longer allows custom properties in configuration.
 Loaders should be updated to allow passing options via loader options in module.rules.

which means that I have to configure it somewhere else.. no idea where though. any ideas?

I'm trying to build a upgrade basic angular workflow based on gulp to webpack, and I'm having sourcemap issues: I end up having the base *.ts sources referenced 2 times and it seems to be due to the `tslint-loader` preloader (I have no issues when I remove it).

I tried many config changes, but so far no luck.

Any ideas?

  var changeHandler = function(err, stats) {

    }

    $.util.log(stats.toString({
      colors: $.util.colors.supportsColor,
      chunks: false,
      hash: false,
      version: false
    }));

    browserSync.reload();

    if (watch) {
      console.log('yeah!');
      watch = false;
      done();
    }
  };

  var sources = [
    path.join(conf.paths.src, '**/*.ts'),
    path.join(conf.paths.src, 'translations/*.po'),
    path.join('!' + conf.paths.bower, '/**/*.ts')
  ];

  if (!test) {
    sources.push(path.join('!' + conf.paths.src, '/**/*.spec.ts'));
    sources.push(path.join('!' + conf.paths.src, '/**/*.mock.ts'));
  }

  return gulp.src(sources)
    .pipe(webpack(options, null, changeHandler))
    .pipe(gulp.dest(path.join(conf.paths.tmp)));
}

gulp.task('scripts', function() {
  return buildScripts(false, false);
});

gulp.task('scripts:watch', function(done) {

});

gulp.task('scripts:test', function() {
  return buildScripts(false, true);
});

gulp.task('scripts:test-watch', function(done) {
  return buildScripts(true, true, done);
});
```

Here is the version of the packages I'm using:

```
""awesome-typescript-loader"": ""^0.17.0-rc.1"",
""ng-annotate-loader"": ""^0.1.0"",
""raw-loader"": ""^0.5.1"",
""tslint"": ""^3.6.0"",
""tslint-loader"": ""^2.1.3"",
""typescript"": ""^1.8.9"",
 ""webpack-stream"": ""^3.1.0"",
```

The generated sourcemaps by tslint have this suffix:

```
[code]

/** WEBPACK FOOTER **
 ** ./~/tslint-loader!./sources/main/main.config.ts
 **/
```

Whereas the ""good"" sourcemaps have this suffix:

```
[code]

/** WEBPACK FOOTER **

```

Seems it may be a path issue?

In our project we need to define `rulesDirectory` option as array of directories in webpack configuration:

```
tslint: {
  rulesDirectory: ['path_1', 'path_2'],
  configuration: {...}
}
```

After merge into internal tslint options object array turns to weird object:

```
rulesDirectory: {
  '0': 'path_1',
  '1': 'path_2'
},
```

Tslint fails to load rules with this configuration as it expects array or string.

The issue is that the `options` object that gets passes in the line `var linter = new Linter(this.resourcePath, input, options);` is structured incorrectly.

Right now it's structured as this:

```
{
  configuration: {
    rulesDirectory: ...
  },
  ...
}
```

when the actual correct structure is like this:

```
{
  configuration: {
    rulesDirectory: ...  // it's okay if this isn't here
  },
  rulesDirectory: ...
}
```

At first this may seem like a bug on the end of TSLint - why doesn't TSLint correctly handle the first case? The issue is a little subtle - paths specified in a `tslint.json` file are relative to the location of the `tslint.json`. So TSLint has no way to resolve those paths when provided via the JS API. When TSLint loads a `tslint.json` file on its own, it can resolve the paths because it knows the location of the `tslint.json file`.

To fix this, you can use the `getRulesDirectories(paths, basePath)` function provided by TSLint to resolve paths from a `tslint.json` file and then provide the paths at the top-level of the options object

I am looking into making a client that would allow screen reader users play HS. Blind and visually impaired people use the computer using a screen reader, which provides feedback through synthetic speech  about the GUI as the user interacts , thus allowing them to understand what is happening. Unfortunately the HS client GUI doesn't implement any accessibility that would allow screen readers to interact with the game, like being able to read info about cards, read what is happening, play cards, etc.

This bot engine looks like a promising way to programmatically get information about what is happening in game and to interact  by performing game actions. So this could be potentially used to create an accessible client for screen reader users. as an MVP, a simple textual command line client would work.

I would like to ask if this project still works with HS. If it does I would like a little help with how to set this up.

This has been discussed in #9 but imo needs its own issue.

What usually happens is it will:
1) Say 'Shattered Sun Cleric > Friendly Minion'
2) Click the battlecry minion
3) Play the battlecry minion
4) Not click who it was told to target with it
5) Attempt to continue playing, usually results in the battlecry being used on the next friendly minion to attack, for example. Sometimes it just spasms out at this stage, constantly playing and canceling until it targets a random minion.

I saw you say in another thread that this could be caused by me? I am using the most up to date client, have based my bot off of the Python base example, and the command is properly ""popped up"" in game.

@lanhin Said that this is caused by: ""playing the battlecry"" is a targeted action `[cleric, minion]`, but once it is placed (and not yet battlecried), it becomes a different PlayOption halfway through, similar to that of an attack. So now it is `[cleric], [cleric, minion]` if you want to play a battlecry minion.

I do not want opponents to know they are playing a bot, so I have started trying to work on a function that makes it ""act natural"" during its turn.

`Python3`
I run the function once a turn using the following code:
```
# Do the following only once per turn
    global turn_counter
    if scene['Self']['Resources'] not in turn_counter:
        turn_counter.append(scene['Self']['Resources'])
        print('Turn ' + str(scene['Self']['Resources']) + ' has started')  # Debug
        once_per_turn(scene)


def once_per_turn(scene):
    act_natural(scene)
```
`turn_counter` is reset to a value of `[0]` every time the bot Mulligans, which denotes a new game.
It's not perfect, since using the coin on turn one makes it think that it is a new turn, and then turn two won't run the `once_per_turn()` function.

Anyway, acting natural is done with the very simple:
```
def act_natural(scene):
    # Pause for a bit so I don't look like a bot so much
    sleep(random.randint(2, 6) * enemy_minion_count(scene))  # Wait longer if the enemy has more minions, as if thinking.


def enemy_minion_count(scene):
    minion_count = 0
    for minion in scene['Opponent']['Minions']:
        minion_count += 1
    return minion_count
```
And I am very **un**happy with how it works. While waiting, the entire game freezes. The first time this happened I thought I had managed to crash Hearthstone.

**What I need in order to make it better:**
- A `wait` or `pause` feature to allow the bot to take human-like time to think, without locking the game up.
- A `hover` feature to tell the game to hover over certain cards, minions that the enemy just played, etc. This is probably the biggest issue the bot has with acting natural.
- The ability to receive and/or respond to the ""Greetings, Thanks, Wow"" chat, for that human touch.

I try to open one file using fvim in a new tab from the command line on Windows. In GVim, it has a `--remote-tab-silent` option to achieve. Native neovim did not support that (https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/11493). On Mac and Linux, it can be achieved using the `neovim-remote` which did not work well on Windows (https://github.com/mhinz/neovim-remote/issues/133). I saw fvim has already implemented the `--nvr` parameter cross-platform. But due to my limited knowledge, I didn't know how to do that in command line.

nvim --listen 127.0.0.1:10710 --headless ""test.txt"" | fvim --nvr 127.0.0.1:10710

When I'm trying to type characters which needs AltGr to be pressed (for example
the @ in the German Layout) it appears some kind escape character sequence. 

I noticed it, because I use AltGr quite heavily using the US International Layout
in Windows and Linux. 

An example using the US International Layout on Windows:

- Using US International Layout on Windows
- Opening fvim
- Going into insert mode
- Typing AltGr + q
  - This prompts with an `^` similar to using Ctrl+V in insert mode
- Typing AltGr + q again, would result into printing `<M-C-Q>` which infect is the key combination I pressed

Expected behavior:

AltGr +q should print the character `ä` when using US International Layout

When thinking about it, using AltGr behaves exactly the same as using Ctrl-V
in insert mode `:help i_CTRL-V`.

I also had confirmed this behavior on Linux, however i can not reconfirm right
now, as I do not have the machine available right now.",NA,FALSE,https://api.github.com/repos/yatli/fvim,https://api.github.com/repos/yatli/fvim/issues/123/labels{/name},https://api.github.com/repos/yatli/fvim/issues/123/comments,https://api.github.com/repos/yatli/fvim/issues/123/events,https://github.com/yatli/fvim/issues/123,NA

I've been trying to use this along with neovim-qt.
This issue with completion popup behavior... I initially thought that this might be a Coc.nvim or vim-go issue - but with neovim-qt since things work properly, this seems to be a UI issue.

1. In a go file with Coc.nvim installed, typing the first letter completes the entire word - so you then have to backspace over
https://i.imgur.com/VlYZT8S.mp4

2. With a json file, the above behavior isn't seen - but selecting a completion results in malformed json (quotes are incorrectly placed at the end of the json value as well)

3. Overall, behavior of the popup in json file flickers a lot.

```

So i tried to record a screencast of the JSON behavior and discovered that this seems to be triggered only **after** I visit a go file and try completions there

You'll notice that the symbols for ALE on the sign bar aren't rendered correctly, nor are some of the statusline symbols, nor the symbols for coc.nvim.

```vim

italic_font      Roboto Mono Italic Nerd Font Complete Mono
bold_italic_font Roboto Mono Bold Italic Nerd Font Complete Mono
font_size 10.0
```
and I'm on Arch Linux with the latest AUR FVim and Neovim built from master 12/12/2019.

The additional difference in the FVim screenshot - the `coc.nvim` documentation floating window showing vs. in terminal Neovim - seems to be due to some weird interaction with FVim and `coc.nvim`. I sometimes see the first item selected and confirmed instantly for me in FVim whereas it is not in Neovim. This seems like a separate issue, though.

The specific symbols not rendering are:
- 🗙, ➤ in the sign bar
- ⏺ in the statusline at the lower left-hand corner - I suspect this might be due to a width issue, as the very similar symbol ● renders correctly slightly to the right in the statusline.

I just installed the latest release and found that the file manager plugin I use [defx.nvim](https://github.com/Shougo/defx.nvim) is now visually opening folders when I press a navigation key AFTER the open folder command.

Previously it worked like this:
1) Navigate the cursor to a folder node
2) Press `o` to ""Open"" the node (now the folder is open and the buffer shows the files/folders beneath.

On the latest version of fvim, it's operating like this:
1) Navigate cursor to folder node
2) Press `o` (seemingly nothing happens)
3) Press a navigational key (`k` or `j`) the buffer updates to show the files/folders beneath.

The only change I made was updating `fvim` to the latest version so maybe there has been some changes to what triggers a buffer visual refresh or something?

I've included two gif recordings in case my textual description is lacking.

When I use the native macOS button to enter or exit full screen it works as expected. If I run `FVimToggleFullScreen` the app may crash or it may attempt to switch mode. If it wasn't in full screen the window is resized to a smaller one and the title bar disappears. You can resize it though by dragging its borders and keep using it so you can `:q` to close it. I tried to take a screenshot of that state but the FVim window doesn't appear 😱

Expected:
Line height goes to 0, everything looks weird. Can still use / input.

What happens:
Sometimes it freezes, can not input or see any render, but can close normally.
Sometimes the process hangs and cannot input anything and need to terminate process (ctrl alt del).

Reproduce:
1. Need to open decent size file, I use `fvim/ui.fs`
2. (Optional) Have decent line height already `:FVimFontLineHeight 'default'`
3. Set line height 0 `:FVimFontLineHeight '0'`
Sometimes will freeze, sometimes will hang
Sometimes will work (this is only true if file isn't big enough for me)

Btw I have decent speed machine (Ryzen 3600, 16GB memory, geforce 1050)

I confirmed undoing change in #60 will not do this, it _always_ will clip. So no different renders. Setting line height to +1.5 (for me) will fix clipping height.

After change in #60 I see there is the __possibility__ can fix height issue without need for line height setting. Problem now is it will revert on subsequent renders (or go back and forth). Setting line height to +1.5 for me will fix this too (no back and forth). But as shown in gif, it can render properly without need for line height.

Then one day `:Ex` will freeze every time. Restart fvim or Windows 10 doesn't fix. But CtrlP or `:e` work fine.

I figured out how to reproduce. It has something to do with conflicting default? dirs for neovim. 

1. Open neovim in WSL `$ nvim` in a terminal (no need to do anything after)
2. Create a Windows shortcut for fvim with --wsl (target Fvim.exe --wsl, Start in: empty) this should make default dir the Windows desktop dir or wherever you created shortcut)
3. Start fvim through shortcut, Do `:Ex` in fvim

Now it freezes, fvim will be in a bad state where it freezes everytime you `:Ex` no matter what dir you pick.

To fix, have to 'sync' with WSL neovim backend.
1. neovim in WSL do `:Ex <pick a dir>`
2. fvim do `:Ex <same dir as above>` 

Now everything works again. For me I can reproduce with these steps every time. Think it has something to do with fvim getting stuck on path translation once it sees an error (C:\ instead of /mnt/c).

Once you fix, the shortcut created no longer causes issues. Have to re-create a new shortcut to force the problem again and re-do all steps exactly.

So far I was just launching the app by double-clicking the FVim.app that came with the dmg release. I was wondering if I could have several fvim processes with different projects (root workspace folders) in them? 

Is there way to launch multiple instances of fvim and/or launch it from the command line? The [launch options](https://github.com/yatli/fvim#startup-options) from readme give me some hint that it's possible.

I've set my US keyboard to use a Colemak layout in macOS. I'm noticing that fvim still inputs characters as if I was on the default layout.

I saw that in the readme you mentioned that the [input method support](https://github.com/yatli/fvim#goals) is still a work in progress. 

So this means that for now Colemak is not yet supported or is there a way to activate support for it?

### Description

I'm running the lastest release (0.2) and my powerline symbols does show up but not as fuild as it is on nvim-qt or terminal. The problem seems to be that the colors are not being applied to the powerline extension, I suspect of that because, if I change the colorscheme on a running instance the editor changes its colors but the powerline does not, remaining on the previous colorscheme until restart with the new colorscheme set on `init.vim`

This is a question more than a bug I think. We have some user entries in AzureAD which will share a number of details with the same users AD claim such as their email for example. When searching in a people picker field we require exact matches on AzureCP which we use to filter out the AD duplicates which works for searching.

However if you assign a user via People Picker to a field on a list item using their AD username. Save the list item, and then edit it again it then picks up the duplicate entries and asks the user to resolve. It will do this every time the user edits the list item which is non-ideal as not all users will correctly identify which one is the correct claim.

With the aim of solving this is there a way we can filter out duplicate entries from AzureAD without hindering the ability to share with guest users? I get the feeling I might be missing something really simple as we dont have this issue with previous claims providers on older instances.",NA,FALSE,https://api.github.com/repos/Yvand/AzureCP,https://api.github.com/repos/Yvand/AzureCP/issues/122/labels{/name},https://api.github.com/repos/Yvand/AzureCP/issues/122/comments,https://api.github.com/repos/Yvand/AzureCP/issues/122/events,https://github.com/Yvand/AzureCP/issues/122,NA

""[AzureCP] Could not get access token before timeout of 15000ms for tenant 'example.onmicrosoft.com' on cloud instance 'ExampleInstance'""
 
This repeats about 7 or 8 times at which point it would then claim a token and work without issue for an hour. The same then repeats every time the token is refreshed. I updated a Pre-Prod instance to 19.0.20210211.1285 to take advantage of the advised improvements to token handling.
 
**Initial Token Claim after Update:**
The issue has persisted post upgrade on this Pre-Prod instance with the same behaviour and initial error. With some additional Graph related errors, we didn’t get these on the previous version.
 
**Before Claiming the Token, one instance of:**
""[AzureCP] Unexpected error occurred in Microsoft.Graph could not query tenant 'example.onmicrosoft.com': Microsoft.Graph.ServiceException: Code: InvalidAuthenticationToken  Message: Access token is empty.  Inner Error:  AdditionalData:  date: 2021…""

**After Claiming the Token, Four instances of:**

“[AzureCP] Unexpected error occurred Microsoft.Graph could not query tenant 'example.onmicrosoft.com': System.Threading.Tasks.TaskCanceledException: A task was canceled., Callstack:

at Microsoft.Graph.HttpProvider.<SendRequestAsync.d__19.MoveNext

People Picker will fail to return results saying it can’t reach the server until a search is done after the token claim.

**When next claiming a token after an hour** 

The token takes 7 attempts once again to be claimed and new errors are presented by MicosoftGraph. These stop on their own if a new search is attempted.

**Six Instances of after token claim:**

I did read that there was some troubleshooting done in issue https://github.com/Yvand/AzureCP/issues/86.

I cannot load the mentioned binary in PowerShell either:

However, I can load version 4.0.0.0:

We use SharePoint Foundation 2013 on a Windows Server 2012 R2 server.

I did find another article saying that the error might be fixed by adding a bindingRedirect in web.config here:

But if I have understood correctly, this is not a case with AzureCP, since it uses ""_NuGet package Microsoft.IdentityModel.Clients.ActiveDirectory, which requires System.Net.Http (>= 4.3.4)_"" (https://github.com/Yvand/AzureCP/issues/86#issuecomment-665502831).

Is it possible to have the AzureCP work for 2 SharePoint WebApps that each authenticate against their own enterprise app in Azure Active Directory (same Azure Tenancy)?

I see that the documentation specifies that ""Due to limitations of SharePoint API, do not associate AzureCP with more than 1 SPTrustedIdentityTokenIssuer"" so I assume this will require development of the AzureCP solution to make this possible?

Alternatively, is it more simple to configure the Trusted identity Provider (in Azure AD & SharePoint) to work across both web applications and then continue to use the AzureCP against the 1 SPTrustedIdentityTokenIssuer that is now working on 2 web applications. In this scenario the user security would be assigned at the SharePoint level and not at the AzureAD App level?

The last section of the documentation details this second approach and it looks quite straight forward so I would assume it wouldn't create any issues for AzureCP

I have performed integration of sharepoint wth AAD from https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/saas-apps/sharepoint-on-premises-tutorial#additional-resources link. But my testing is not successful.

Following is the details regarding my testing scenario.
Given - 
1. I have one sharepoint server and userId (firstname.lastname@domain.local), using this userId I can access sharepoint site internally without integrating with AAD.
2. I have created one application in AAD and have a userId(firstname.lastname@comapanyemail.com) and this userId has an UPN configured in ""user.extensionattribute1"" custom attribute.

Testing -

1. as per documentation when I set claims ""name"" and ""unique identifier"" with value ""user.localuserprinciplename"" then user is getting authenticated successfully but the home page of sharepoint is not as same as #1 in given part.
2. when I set claim ""name"" with value ""user.extensionattribute1"" then after login through AAD, SAML claims are getting sent to AzureCP, and AzureCP tries to find ""firstname.lastname@domain.local"" userId which it receives from claim ""name"" and tries searching it in AAD with value as ""firstname.lastname@domain.local"" and type as UPN, but as this value is not present in AAD as UPN then  AzureCP throws an error  saying found 0 record for this match.

Notes -
AzureCP is configured with default configuration as below : 
$realm = ""urn:sharepoint:federation""
$wsfedurl=""URL""
$filepath=""certificate apth""
$cert = New-Object System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509Certificate2($filepath)
New-SPTrustedRootAuthority -Name ""AzureAD"" -Certificate $cert
$map1 = New-SPClaimTypeMapping -IncomingClaimType ""http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/name"" -IncomingClaimTypeDisplayName ""name"" -LocalClaimType ""http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/upn""
$map2 = New-SPClaimTypeMapping -IncomingClaimType ""http://schemas.microsoft.com/ws/2008/06/identity/claims/role"" -IncomingClaimTypeDisplayName ""Role"" -SameAsIncoming
$ap = New-SPTrustedIdentityTokenIssuer -Name ""AzureAD"" -Description ""Azure AD SharePoint server 201x"" -realm $realm -ImportTrustCertificate $cert -ClaimsMappings $map1,$map2 -SignInUrl $wsfedurl -IdentifierClaim $map1.InputClaimType

Problem Identifier Path - 
I have identified from testing that if AzureCP searches for ""mail"" instead of ""UPN"" for value it received from claim ""name"" in SAML response from AAD then we'll be good for our testing to get passed.

For this I already tried editing AzureCP claims configuration but it is not getting edited successfully.

Could you please help checking on this part and let me know if you need any help on this.


Thanks

So, I'm wondering if there is a way to get AzureCP to use either DOMAIN\username or username@on-premdomain.local format for the unique identifier.

I am working on a PowerShell script to switch the User Identifier to Mail then add the user using the mail attribute to the site collection, once complete then switch the User Identifier back to UserPrincipalName.

$config.ResetClaimTypesList()
$config.Update()`

However I am unsure on how to change it back to UserPrincipalName using PowerShell.

This will assist me in allowing Guest users from other O365 tenancies into my SharePoint on-prem whilst still allowing Guest users with Windows Live accounts.

* Improved validation of changes made to ClaimTypes collection
* Added method ClaimTypeConfigCollection.GetByClaimType()
* Implemented unit tests
* Explicitly encode HTML messages shown in admin pages and rendered from server side code to comply with tools scanning code to detect security vulnerabilities
* Fixed display text of groups that were not using the expected format ""(GROUP) groupname""

This release introduces a lot of changes and improvements, and moved away from the old Azure AD Graph API to the unified Microsoft Graph.
> **Important:** This version has breaking changes, please [check this page](https://yvand.github.io/AzureCP/Update-AzureCP.html) if you update from an earlier version.

## Changelog
- Improved: AzureCP now uses the unified [Microsoft Graph API](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/) instead of the old [Azure AD Graph API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-graph-api).
- New: AzureCP can be entirely configured with PowerShell, including claim types configuration
- Updated: AzureCP administration pages are now created as User Controls and are reusable by developers.
- Improved: AzureCP claims mapping page is easier to understand
- Updated: Logging is more relevant and generates less messages.
- New: Timeout of connection is 4 secs and can be customized
- Improved: When multiple tenants are set, they are queried in parallel
- Updated: Tenant ID is no longer needed to register a tenant
- Improved: Nested groups are now supported, if group permissions are created using the ID of groups (new default setting).
- **Beaking change**: By default, AzureCP now creates group permissions using the Id of the group instead of its name (group IDs are unique, not names). There are 2 ways to deal with this: Modify group claim type configuration to reuse the name, or migrate existing groups permissions to set their values with their group ID
- **Beaking change**: Due to the amount of changes in this area, the claim types configuration will be reset if you update from an earlier version.

I am seeing the following behaviour after installing AzureCP.  User account created in Azure AD appear as username_FQDN#EXT#@AzureDomain.onmicrosoft.com for a user with username@FQDN.  This name appears in the picker in SharePoint 2013 and can be used for alerts, etc. (email and other property values are accessible), however, if you try to login with the email address and password, it fails.  If I select, bypass Azure AD lookup, I can use the email address as a value in the picker and can login using the credentials, but the property values are not mapped, so alerts and emails do not work.  Have you seen this behaviour before?

I added the tenant as the GUID identifier initially before the updated to the May 14th commit.  Once no results were returned from the claim picker, I added tenant.onmicrosoft.com as well as tenant.microsoftonline.com. Once the other two tenant identifiers were added, the configuration page threw the error shown above.  The configuration change seems to have applied.  Is there a way to clean this out and try again?

I'd like to extend AzureCP and do it your approved way.  I see that you have a developer samples download for LDAPCP, but can't find the same for AzureCP.   I've looked over the developer sample for LDAPCP and LDAPCP itself, but am not sure if I can just follow that same pattern with AzureCP or not.

My specific project is to have multiple SP web applications in my farm, each with a tenant-specific AzureCP-based custom claims provider.  AzureCP OOB works perfectly for the first tenant\first web application.  Now I need the same functionality on the 2nd web application for the 2nd tenant, and so forth.  It seems like the way to do this is create a farm solution for each web application, that inherits the base AzureCP class and uses a unique claim provider name and modifies the configuration for the specific tenant.

Am I headed in the right direction?  Would you be able to publish a downloadable developer sample for how to extend this way?

I were able to prepare some code that compiles correctly.
Unfortunatly i am not able to test the result as:
- i can't sign the assembly (complains that Nito.AsyncEx is not strong named)
- i suppose the assembly should be in the GAC to be used by sharepoint

Nevertheless i think the logic to filter shadow accounts is sound (naturaly i did it :D).

Would consider merging it in AzureCP?

When working with multiple tenants, the invitations process and api can generate confusion.

If Sharepoint is linked with one tenant:
- multiple result on lookup: invited users and native users in their tenant.
- inviting a user from another tenant does not work until the user is properly invited.
- previous question is valid on inviting a group (role)

What would you think of the proposition to:
- integrate azure ad invatitation api (users and groups).
- detect correlation between guest accounts (shadow users from primary tennant) and primary account in another tennant (configured in azurecp). So that only the primary account is shown.

thanks for the usefull tool!

Currently we have the AzureCP configured to map claims/upn to property to query: mail.
This allows the following account types to login/resolve:
-Guest Users within a Federated Directory (B2B user with ADFS on their side)
-Guest User without a Federated Directory (B2B user without ADFS)
-AAD Security group roles
This configuration however **does not work** with:
-Local accounts created with an onmicrosoft.com address i.e someone@tenant.onmicrosoft.com

When configured as default (claims/upn mapped to query UPN):
Accounts that work:
-Local accounts created with an onmicrosoft.com address i.e someone@tenant.onmicrosoft.com
-Guest Users within a Federated Directory (B2B user with ADFS on their side)
Accounts that **don't work**:
-Guest User without a Federated Directory (B2B user without ADFS)

Can you confirm this is a limitation or is their a configuration change that can be made to have all account types work?

I want to ask if it's possible and how to filter out specific users via LDAP filter

We have SharePoint 2016 with ADFS and LDAPCP 14.1.20191007.981 and I've created an LDAP filter that is working via PowerShell, but I don't know how te set this in LDAPCP, I've tried to set this LDAP filter in the claims type configuration from the UPN claim, but this is probable not correct and it is also not working.

I've tried to find different forums, but I haven't found anything helpful. So that is way I'm asking here.

Can anyone tell me if it's possible to use such a LDAP filter in LDAPCP?
This is the LDAP filter that I want to use:  (&(objectClass=user)(extensionAttribute11=0))

We also have a SharePoint farm with NTLM authentication and there I was able to put the filter on the WebApp and that is working fine, because we use ADFS authentication and LDAPCP on this farm I'm supposed I have to set the filter someway via LDAPCP.

I reach out to you once again for your input.
Building on the scenario I described in #124 

The SharePoint farm and external users are in Domain 1
The internal users are in Domain 2

I want to give read access for all internal users in Domain 2 by adding a Role Claim to the SharePoint visitors-group.
If user have role-claim ""R-App-SharePoint"" then grant permission.

ADFS is currently configured
ADFS server “adfs-domain2.com”, have a rule that adds role-claim with value ""R-App-SharePoint"" if user is member of ""DOMAIN2\R-App-Sharepoint"" on relying party ""fs.domain2.com""

On relying party “fs.domain2.com” the following is configured:
1. Added rule on claim providers to ""adfs.domain2.com"" that all role-claims that starts with ""R-App-SharePoint"" shall be forwarded.
2. Added rule on relying party ""sharepoint.domain2.com"" that it shall forward all role-claims with value ""R-App-SharePoint"" (This is the RP that is used as URN in SharePoint)

The reason for this configuration is because we do not want to send all groups as claims, as external users could see them.

I have activated Augmentation in global configuration, but peopepicker does not resolve role claim ""R-App-SharePoint"". I was hoping to add this claim to the visitors-group. 

Augmetation activated: (not sure what .net-helper is but activated it just in case...)

I have the following setup:
A SharePoint 2019 farm with a colab-portal and a mysite-portal.
It has two User Profile Service connections setup. Both uses Trusted Identity Claim Provider to sync users from different domain.
Lets call them:
- SharePoint.local
- External.com

After installing LDAPCP I get results from sharepoint.local domain which the SharePoint servers are connected to.
I then added ldap://external.com domain in hope that the people picker would resolve external users awell, but unfortunately not. People picker only shows the sharepoint.local domain users.

When I try to invite a user from external.com, I am presented with the errormessage:
""This site cannot be shared with external users"" even tho I have activated the functionality to share the site from ""site settings -> users and groups -> settings for access requests""
I removing LDAPCP from the trustedidentityprovider to verify that this functionality works, and it does.

The user profile service works fine tho. I can see that all the users are synched fine. 
Do you have any pointers for me to go on? 

Also: Is there a way to get LDAPCP to only show users from the OU that the UPA is synchronizing? 
Grateful for any input on this issue :) (and sorry if this question seems stupid, Im a ldap novice...)

I need your point of view for my case.

We have the following infrastructure and configuration :
- SharePoint 2016 servers
- ADFS server for SSO : ( a custom Trusted Identity Token Issuer )
- Office Online Server

What we did : 
- Create a new web app that have another trusted identity token issuer that has LDAPCP as claimprovider
- Configure the new web app with the new trusted identity provider

The problem we're facing : 
- In order for the new web app sites to authenticate through the new trusted identity provider, we needed to add the ""?trust=LDAPCPConnect"" param to the ""Custom sign in page url""
![2020-06-08 17_40_29-Window](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8361028/84051449-7a08f600-a9af-11ea-9127-b0edf2c6c51a.png)
- Once the param added, the sign is experience works perfectly. However, when we try to open an Excel or Word file on the desktop app, a blank authentication form appears and authentication process is blocked.
- If we remove the ""?trust=LDAPCPConnect"" param, Excel and Word files opens successfully on desktop apps but web app sites won't authenticate through ""LDAPCPConnect"" trusted identity provider.

Any idea on how to fix this problem ? If not, do you have any workaround ?

We have a SharePoint 2019 attached to three active directories via ADFS and with three SPTrustedIdentityTokenIssuer.
Now we want to implement the lookup into all three AD via LDAPCP.
In the section ""For developers"" on ldapcp.com I found the line
    ""Use LDAPCP with multiple SPTrustedIdentityTokenIssuer.""
that suggests, it's possible. But the message after that
    ""Each class inheriting LDAPCP is a unique claims provider, and only 1 can be installed at a time by the feature event receiver.""
is one I dont understand.
In  [Issue#94](https://github.com/Yvand/LDAPCP/issues/94) it seems @tah78 has made it, but how? Has anyone a guidance/example/documentation for me to extend LDAPCP and how to deal with this event receiver line above?

That would be great!

I go through the issue #96 reported.

I am also exactly facing same issue after we migrated SharePoint 2013 to SharePoint 2019.
In SharePoint 2013 we used LDAPCP claim provider and it worked perfectly with default ladap connection. We are using ADFS SAML token authentication. 

Where as in SP2019 I tried with newer version LDAP 14.1... but I am getting error while adding users to any SharePoint group after adding LDAP claim provider.

I followed the above conclusion in this thread. But I am still facing this issue. 
Error logs

Could you explain do i missing any thing here?

We are unable to search users by their displayName, if change LDAP class value of ""User identifier properties"" to some other value.

So, I have added two connection strings - one is of our AD and another one is of LDAP. and there is this ""User identifier properties"" setting and their defaults values are **user** for class and **mail** for attributes. But in our LDAP there is no such object class as **user** and hence search query on LDAP directory doesn't work.

I use LDAPCP and ADFS with SharePoint Server 2019. I added two LDAP connections to two different ADs. Everything is working so far. That means I can add users and roles to site collection admins and sharepoint groups and so on. Also logging in with ADFS works as aspected.

I can also add an user to a people picker field in a list and save the list item without errors. But when I try to open that item in ""modern"" UI mode to edit it, I get the following error (see screenshots below): ""Multiple entries matched, please click to resolve"". When I click on the user to resolve, it shows up one entry with an empty user picture. Normally there is an icon with two persons shown, after people picker resolves the entered string and matches an user.

When I edit the same list entry in ""classic"" mode, everything is fine. Has this something to do with my config, is this a known behaviour or an issue?

LDAPCP works great. The one question I had is that to make it work over port 636 with Secured Sockets Layer. To make this work for user profile synchronization we had to use a client certificate.

* Fixed the augmentation that randomly failed under high load, caused by a thread safety issue on list ILDAPCPConfiguration.LDAPConnectionsProp
* Added handling of special characters for LDAP filters as documented in https://ldap.com/ldap-filters/
* Added the first nae (givenName) in the list of attributes queried by default
* Improved validation of changes made to ClaimTypes collection
* Added method ClaimTypeConfigCollection.GetByClaimType()
* Implemented unit tests
* Explicitely encode HTML messages shown in admin pages and renderred from server side code to comply with tools scanning code to detect security vulnerabilities
* Deactivating farm-scoped feature ""LDAPCP"" removes the claims provider from the farm, but it does not delete its configuration anymore. Configuration is now deleted when feature is uninstalled (typically when retracting the solution)
* Added user identifier properties in global configuration page

We need your suggestion on below:

**Scenario:**
We have some SharePoint sites that are accessible to all in the organization as well as accessible to external users via default group 'Everyone'

**Requirement:**
Now there are some sites that shouldn't be accessible to external users, but should be accessible to members within the organizations. For this case the default group of Everyone doesn't help.

We know permission in SharePoint can be assigned via userID, Security AD group or default group like Everyone.

We would like to know if it it possible to assign permission on SharePoint based on “OUs”, “AD attribute” or “Wildcards” using **LDAPCP**.


**Examples:**
1.	Assign permissions to all users of a particular OU. If there are different OUs for employees and external users.
2.	Allow access to all users who have AD attribute “employeeType=Employee”
3.	Allow access to all users who have userid starting with “X-****”

We are experiencing this issue where users inteminnently are getting HTTP error 500 with message ""The server is busy now. Try again later"".
This happens after user is authenticatet and redirected to https://site/_trust/ 

In ULS I can see that calls to securitytoken.svc time out after 60 sec. It happens on both frontends.
The servers are not under pressure, doesn't look like a hardware capacity issue. Restarting SecurityTokenServiceAppPool seem to help but not for a long period.

This farm is using LDAPCP, and I'm wondering if our LDAPCP's configuration somehow contribute to the issue, specially the augmentation part of it. 

- LDAPCP the only thing that is unique comparing to other farms
 
- Users can be members of up to 500 AD groups 

- The token issued by ADFS contains claim ""Role"" with users group membership, but this is ignored and LDAPCP augmentation of ""Role"" is used, getting the same memberships from identity providers directly using LDAP

- Can see LDAP errors occuring in ULS, LDAP timeouts or LDAP Unknown error (0x8000500c). Usually when it happens users get ""This page is not shared with you..."" message

Is there anything with this configuration and symptoms that can cause securitytoken.svc timeouts when converting external to internal token og should I search for a solution somewhere else?

there is a subtle issue with the method ""Augment"" for the Claims Augmentation. If a WebApplication has multiple different authentication methods, e.g. Windows, Forms & ADFS, the method FillClaimsForEntity will be called with different kinds of identities, latest when a token is re-issued after 1 hour. This in turn alls Augment for the heavy lifting which in turn calls ""RunWithElevatedPrivileges"" as it's first action.
This call will result in a call to FillClaimsForEntity if the user is not a Windows user, e.g. a Forms user,  creating an infinite loop resulting in a Stack Overflow.

Consider a scenario where a user is granted XYZ permission via AD group in SharePoint (and not explicitly using his ID).

I am trying to configure LDAPCP to search users in an LDAP directory. In this directory, user objects do NOT have the attribute ""objectClass = user"". They do have other classes, for instance ""objectClass = person"".

LDAPCP by default will create queries such as this one:
`(&(objectclass=user)(displayName=john*))`

This returns 0 results obviously, because no users have this objectclass. So I'm trying to create this query instead:
`(&(objectclass=person)(displayName=john*))`

But I don't understand how I can create this rule using the GUI? There seem to be no option to create additional ""linked to identity claim"" rules.

We have a scenario where certain users have their ID which is a subset for other user's ID like the below example.

User with ID: dpatil

For this user when we search in people picker with LDAPCP we see multiple entries like dptail1, dpatil2, dpatil10. In other words dpatil is a subset for other login IDs as well.

Now we have a service url that pulls the data from a list in SharePoint. Below is the snippet of the code that runs while accessing the service URL.
*****************************************************************
public static string GetCurrentUserLoginName(string loginName, ClientContext clientContext)
        {

            var spUser = clientContext.Web.EnsureUser(loginName);
            clientContext.Load(spUser, user => user.LoginName);
            clientContext.ExecuteQuery();
            return ConvertUsernameToClaim(clientContext, spUser.LoginName);
        }
*****************************************************************
When such users (whose ID is a substring for other users ID as well in AD) try to access this service URL, they get error message “The specified user <userid> could not be found” in the browser.

However when we use the “Exact match” option in LDAPCP configuration page, this issue doesn’t occur for these users. But we cannot opt for this option for business reasons.

**Question**: Is there anything from LDAPCP side that can be done to tackle such scenarios when one user ID is a subset for other user IDs and accessing these service URLs?

I started to use this provider a few days ago for testing and it seems like a solid solution. I have one minor issue though I am not sure if is supported or not and that is the usage of the objectSid attribute. When setting things up I get the attribute back but in binary form as stored in AD. So I think this will solve itself with a conversion to string? Is this a possiblity to implement or am I missing something here? I would very much like to use this with groups so renaming of groups would not interfere with access rules. We use this today with the default provider and the Token-Groups as SID's with no problem. Just the extra little admin fuzzle with copy pasting SID's.

I'm in a case where I would like to read an Active directory where the users are actually contacts and not users. How can I search on contacts in the directory instead of users?
Can you help me?
Any plan to make an option for this (search also in contacts and not only users) in your application?
This is because in the context of ADFS we use FIM to replicate users from a federated company and re-create them into our directory as contacts for security reasons. So we would do the people picker in our directory instead of the initial directory also for security reasons.
