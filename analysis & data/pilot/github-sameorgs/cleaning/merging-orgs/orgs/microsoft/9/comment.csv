i've been working on the implementation of the missing mapping features for the database driver
you can see the diff with my fork here, https://github.com/tg123/sshpiper/compare/master...ironashram:master

i basically took inspiration from the yaml driver and made a few adjustments, still there may be work to do.
i'm writing to eventually start a discussion, will this be something you would be interested in merging? We are thinking of using this in the near future but the missing mapping function for the database driver is something we need

the middle ware to handle request from downstream and find proper upstream to it

working_dir: using a home-like directory structure to route
database: put routing info into a database, such as mysql
yaml: put all routing info in a yaml file

working_dir is easy to understand but cannot do some 'rich' routing, for example, regex.

you should use `--upstream-driver=` to choose which provide you want to use

upstream_uprovider management tools:
`sshpiperd pipe *` is the management tools for upstream provider

`hostkey` is not supported and sshpiper cannot pass any key base info to upstream
sshpiper must have a valid `private key`, host or user, to talk to upstream.

I am still writing tests to cover all scenorias

here is how to use it

```
./sshpiperd daemon -u yaml --upstream-yaml-file=sshpiperd.yaml

here is the example config and explained

- simple@piper -> root@172.17.0.2
- passmap@piper -> root@172.17.0.2 (you can use password `pass` which will be mapped to `root`)
- key1@piper -> root@172.17.0.2 (you can use password `key` which will be mapped to privatekey `pk1` when auth to upstream)
- keymapany@piper -> root@172.17.0.2 (any publickey from downstream will be mapped to pk1)
- keymap@piper -> root@172.17.0.2 (publickey from downstream in key_map.authorized_keys will be mapped to pk1)
- k.* is same as above but use regex username matching

how this will be solution to your case

_note_: the different from `from.authorized_keys` and `to.key_map.authorized_keys` is that the first one means to authenticate the downstream while `to.key_map.authorized_keys` means the downstream is authenticated and searching for privatekey to upstream

`cat sshpiperd.yaml`

sshpiper works in steps below

 1. downstream < --- encrypted ---> sshpiper 
 1. sshpiper decrypts data from downstream (can only be decrypted by sshpiper bc this is the conn to piper)
 1. sshpiper re-encrypts data
 1.  sshpiper < --- encrypted ---> upstream (can only be decrypted by upstream)

this happens no matter password/public auth or even none auth.

the reason publickey cannot send to upstream is that 
 
 1. sshpiper claims I have the public key1 to upstream (which declares it owns private key1 implicitly)
 1. upstream encrypts some random number using public key1 and sent is back to sshpiper
 1. sshpiper cannot decrypt it bc sshpiper do not have private key1 to do so
 1. upsteam asks sshpiper to show the random number
 1. sshpiper failed to do so and connection closed by upstream

the reason why password works is that
downstream has to send full password text to sshpiper
as a result, upstream does not know whether the connection is from sshpiper (mid man) or downstream

asymmetric keys are designed to prevent some one steals your password in the mid
bc, even you steal the password (public key), the upsteam can also you are fake.


back to your case, you have to be a man in the mid to do piper things.

Do I understand it correct, that to work with SSH_KEYS (authorized keys)
they can't be passed thru transparent?

on CLIENT PC there is an id (ssh-keygen) like me@gitea / me@gitea.pub

The content of .pub is installed as SSH Key on a gitea User Profile (like Github)

To allow: 

> git clone gitea@sshpiper-server/user/repo

normally the local private key is used.

haven't tried mysql backend. But I don't know if it will be easier to do, because I need to update, create and delete users.

With docker-gen I can create a csv which need to be parsed by a script (update directories / files or database entries). Single step creation would need a single config file (csv, passwd format for example?) with one user per line for example.

Yes this can be reproduced every time when using Rsync. I have tested with scp and this technically completes, though at the end of the transfer the connection is terminated resulting in scp displaying and error message that the connection was halted.

Everything seems to work fine with a smaller file e.g. 512mb, however it appears that anything over 900mb has the issue. I have amended the keep-alive settings ensure it is sent every 60 seconds, however the problem still persists.

I have tested this in multiple setups using the docker image and without. In all cases the results are the same, the connection terminates at the end of the transfer.

I have also tested this on both Linux (Debian) and OSX, the problem is the same on both operating systems. For reference this has only been tested on a WAN connection.

For SSHv2 connections, the session key is auto renegotiated after some some large number of packets have been sent or some amount of time has elapsed. These defaults are specific to the cypher being used. This renegotiation could be triggered by the server or client. For me, this occurs after 1GB of TOTAL data transfer over rsync (all individual files < 1GB).  

I have tried every workaround I can think of. The most hopeful was setting ""RekeyLimit 2G 36000"" for host and client endpoints (/etc/sshd_conf and ~/.ssh/config). Oddly, this had no effect and the transfer still gets closed after 1GB. I know these settings are getting read by sshd because when I set them to absurdly large values, i.e. 1000G, I get the message ""RekeyLimit too large"".

The error itself ""only handshakeTransport can send newKeys"" comes out of GO's ssh implementation. I do not know and I have not tested the native GO implementation, but I would assume that because key renegotiation is a part of the SSHv2 spec, that this implementation would fully support this. I'm guessing that because sshpiper has to man-in-the-middle the SSH connection that there is some extra work that needs to be done to handle the renegotiation. I have not looked at the code so this is just wild speculation. 

In any case, thanks for putting this project together. sshpiper has been super useful to me.

It gets complicated even more when you want to use different loaders for styles and templates, in my case `['exports-loader?module.exports.toString()', 'css-loader', 'sass-loader']` and `['raw-loader']`. For templates, I need angular2-template-loader to write `require(${url}).default` because of ES2015 export, and current `require(${url})` for styles, since it's still CommonJS.

As a proof of concept, I moved code that formats require string into configuration option:
```js
function replaceStringsWithRequires(string, formatRequire = (url) => 'require(\'' + url + '\')') {
    return string.replace(stringRegex, function(match, quote, url) {
        if (url.charAt(0) !== '.')
            url = './' + url;

        return formatRequire(url);
    });
}
```
and used the following loader config:
```js
{
    test: /\.(ts)$/,
    exclude: /\.spec\.ts$/,
    use: {
        loader: 'angular2-template-loader',
        options: {
            formatRequire(url) {

What you should do is add an additional loader that uses our new `issuer:` feature. This allows you to filter which loader gets processed based on the file that requested it. 

Therefore, if a ts file imports a .css/.html file, you can specially define and chain loaders.

Heres some relevant documentation. https://webpack.js.org/configuration/module/#rule

You may experiment with `issuer: /\.component\.ts/` or something similar.

Probably this also has got related to the fact the templateUrl doesnt work without a comma . I found out this peculiar issue today.

I am really new to angular 2 and web pack.  Working on my first project.  I built from scratch using Full framework and the spa template as an example.  Using version 0.6.2 in both and the core(standard 1.0) works fine like everyone else says.  the Core(full .net) gives the same error as before.  I was able to get the core(full) to work by going to 0.6.0 and adding the require statements as talked about above.  I don't really understand how these two could be different since all of this should not be dependent on the framework but I can't figure it out. ,NA,https://api.github.com/repos/TheLarkInn/angular2-template-loader/issues/50/comments,https://github.com/TheLarkInn/angular2-template-loader/issues/50#issuecomment-281890845,https://api.github.com/repos/TheLarkInn/angular2-template-loader/issues/50

it seems to me I'm getting into the same issue. Put my hands back on a project that I left for a couple of weeks, and now got this new errors.

Building and bundling goes fine, but then at runtime in dev console I see a couple of wrong HTML requests:

> GET http://localhost:51254/templates/default/color-picker.component.html 404 (Not Found)
GET http://localhost:51254/component.html 404 (Not Found)

with their accompanying `Failed to load ...` error messages. It seems like all of a sudden relative `templateUrl` are not respected anymore. Originally those are:

```ts
// some component file
templateUrl: './templates/default/color-picker.component.html',

// another component file
templateUrl: './component.html',
```

and, by chance (for our code convetion), there's already a trailing comma. I also tried swapping single quotes for double quotes.

I tried with angular2-template-loader 0.6.0 and 0.6.2, with no luck. Other dependencies: 

* @angular/*** 2.4.8
* angular-router-loader@0.5.0
* awesome-typescript-loader@3.1.2
* core-js@2.4.1
* raw-loader@0.5.1
* reflect-metadata@0.1.10
* typescript@2.2.1
* webpack@2.2.1
* zone.js@0.7.8

Side note, in case might be related:  
before this runtime problem, I incurred into a new build time error, apparently due to an [issue with awesome-typescript-loader](https://github.com/s-panferov/awesome-typescript-loader/issues/382), which required upgrading that dependency.

Same happens for *styleUrls*. Here's one of the many and similar component metadata, which worked until now:

```ts
@Component({
  selector: '[sideBar]',
  templateUrl: './component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./component.css'],

  },
```

Development JIT build instead has only a main bundle for our custom code (beside vendor bundle, that is). But this main bundle only has components common to whole app, and their *templateUrl* is untouched. Furthermore, there are no component from other ""lazy loaded"" modules. It's like if *angular-router-loader* had no effect at all in JIT build.

By peeking at other sample projects, JIT bundle should instead show something like `template: __webpack_require__(/*! ./hero-detail.component.html */ 633),`, right?",NA,https://api.github.com/repos/TheLarkInn/angular2-template-loader/issues/50/comments,https://github.com/TheLarkInn/angular2-template-loader/issues/50#issuecomment-288267630,https://api.github.com/repos/TheLarkInn/angular2-template-loader/issues/50

* Original: `templateUrl: './not-found.component.html',`
* Replaced: `template: require('./not-found.component.html'),`

But indeed when I look at whole bundled JS, I find:

Project is using current latest versions: 

+-- angular-router-loader@0.5.0
+-- angular2-template-loader@0.6.2
+-- awesome-typescript-loader@3.1.2

I missed that change in awesome-typescript-loader settings, hence this project still kept `""useWebpackText"": true` in its *tsconfig.json* files. I tried just now deleting that bit, leaving an empty `""awesomeTypescriptLoaderOptions"": {}`, but nothing changed.

One more finding, which I think is moving the culprit somewhere else, is the following: I temporarily turned on debugging in *angular-router-loader*, and at least from its output one can say that replacement **does** happen:

> [angular-router-loader]: Original: loadChildren: '../private/module#PrivateModule'                                                                  
> [angular-router-loader]: Replacement: loadChildren: () => new Promise(function (resolve) {  (require as any).ensure([], function (require: any) {  resolve(require('..\\private\\module')['PrivateModule']);  })

while in main-bundle.js I still find `loadChildren: '../private/module#PrivateModule',`. So, again, it looks like those two loaders output is not fed into awesome-typescript-loader, or anyway does not make it to the final bundling phase.

?? why decorate shows back initial, original templateUrl instead of template + require, or something else?

1. Move project to another path. Yes, definitely absurd, but I had the issue come and go when changing path. In detail, the original path was longer, but nothing exaggerated. And had no blanks in it. 

1. Similar to previous, create a symlink at a different path. This worked, but for some reason it breaks AOT build

1. As you found, switch to another TS loader

For AoT, @ngtools/webpack is used in place of the combination of awesome-typescript-loader and angular2-template-loader, and the AoTPlugin (shipped within @ngtools/webpack) takes care of your ngc compilation (ngc is a wrapper around tsc that a) transpiles your typescript, and b) does the Ahead-Of-Time compilation that is the namesake of AoT).

For example, here's my loader configuration for JiT builds and AoT builds:

```
exports.ts_JiT = {
  test: /\.ts$/,
  loaders: [
    'awesome-typescript-loader',
    'angular2-template-loader'
  ],
  exclude: [ /\.(spec|e2e|async)\.ts$/ ]
};

exports.ts_AoT = {
  test: /\.ts$/,
  loader: '@ngtools/webpack'
};
```

And my plugin configuration for the AoTPlugin:

```
const AotPlugin = require('@ngtools/webpack').AotPlugin;
...

exports.aot = new AotPlugin({
  tsConfigPath: path.resolve('./tsconfig-aot.json'),

My bad for not being clear: @TheLarkInn is doing a great job, was just asking him what is he suggesting, given the current ""work overload"" and progress in angular-cli . 

Also (my bad again), I'm aware of JIT Vs AOT, and before some recent issues I had with *awesome-typescript-loader* and some I'm now having with *angular2-template-loader*, my team was happy bundling both a dev JIT build as well as an AOT production build, the latter also with *angular-router-loader* and lazy-loading (also waiting on next angular 4 to see some more improvements on tree shaking).

Now, it's a couple of days that we're stuck with these weird issues, in particular #50 and other similar listed here.

Back to your experience, if I got it right: angular-cli and/or @ngtools/webpack can take the place of awesome-typescript-loader + angular2-template-loader, both for JIT and AOT builds. 

Q1: Is that right?
Q2: What happens to lazy-loading in that case?

Yup. Just, personally, I stick to angular2-template-loader and awesome-typescript-loader for my JiT stuff, which is really just for e2e and testing since they compile faster.

> Q2: What happens to lazy-loading in that case?

Pretty sure you can bring in angular-router-loader as part of your JiT build, and @ngtools/webpack handles lazy loaded routes for you when building AoT. See https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ngtools/webpack#features.

> Recognizing the use of loadChildren in the router, and bundling those modules separately so that any dependencies of those modules are not going to be loaded as part of your main bundle. These separate bundles will be pulled out of the critical path of your application, making your total application bundle much smaller and loading it much more performant.

> The intentional design of the loader was to let angular2 users write 'idiomatic' angular components IE specify non strict relative pathing. Which with SystemJS etc. You would not specify the ./

I'd say this might be irrelevant now, as CLI has defaulted and expected users to write the ./ manually for a long time now: https://github.com/angular/devkit/blob/master/packages/schematics/angular/component/files/__path__/__name@dasherize@if-flat__/__name@dasherize__.component.ts#L10

Removing this logic would allow us to do much more in Angular CLI (like for example depending on templates that provide Bootstrap and another project depending on Material ones). 

The lack of flexibility when using Angular/Angular CLI is the biggest reason I regret choosing it. People are suffering trying to create things a little more ambitious than the creators envisioned and they just won't budge.

Found problem, on my side. Adding some console logging to own angular2-template-loader `index.js` showed that loader was not invoked when running tests, and of course was invoked when building in development.

It turned out that, in webpack configuration, angular2-template-loader was only applied to non-spec source files, while spec files only got awesome-typescript-loader. So I guess that when spec source was importing a component, its corresponding source was not going through angular2-template-loader as well. Which is a different behaviour than what I thought.

I mean, the whole point of this loader is to not have angular try and make hundreds of requests to access your templates at runtime, so avoiding using their non-cannonical resolution strategy is a given.  

Also you could create a custom resolver plugin to emulate this behavior instead when a request is being called for `x.component.html`, and alias it to be `./app/x.component.html` if it's that important to you.

Also the regex should work now properly, when you have no missing semicolons in your component class.

So for example the following will fail: 

``` typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'my-test',
  providers: [
    provide(SomeService, {useClass: DefaultSomeService})
  ],
  templateUrl: 'test.component.html'
})
export class TestComponent {
  constructor(someService: SomeService) {
    someService.getSomething({
      option1: 'value1',
      templateUrl: '/this/should/not/match'
    })
    // line above has missing ;  -> regex will fail
  }
}
```

Also this will not work, but i think nobody does it this way:

``` typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'my-test',
  providers: [
    provide(SomeService, {useClass: DefaultSomeService})
  ],
  templateUrl: 'test.component.html'
}) export class TestComponent { ... }   // no new line after decorator

Using an `if` guard works. Ugly, but works. If you have a pattern with the same simbols repeated many times this becomes very ugly.
**Does not work in** `@matchast`.

A possible solution may be to separate syms and automatically generate guards 
so that  `:($D = $D)` becomes `:($D_1 = $D_2) && if D_1 == D_2` under the hood.
I may be wrong but I don't think this is the correct approach though. What if I want to override equality for expressions in my package?

It's not necessarily dynamic if you know the size of the `Tuple`, which is a part of it's type. If you write e.g.
```julia
f(t::Tuple) = @match t (a, b..., c) => (a, b, c)
```
the sizes can be statically known. I'm sure there's a tuple-recursion version, but here's a type inferrable `@generated` function that does it:
```julia
julia> @generated function f(t::NTuple{N}) where {N}
           Expr(:tuple, :(t[1]), Expr(:tuple, (:(t[$i]) for i ∈ 2:N-1)...), :(t[$N]))
       end
f (generic function with 2 methods)

julia> f((1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8))
(1, (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7), 8)

julia> @code_typed f((1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8))
CodeInfo(
1 ─ %1  = Base.getfield(t, 1, true)::Int64
│   %2  = Base.getfield(t, 2, true)::Int64
│   %3  = Base.getfield(t, 3, true)::Int64
│   %4  = Base.getfield(t, 4, true)::Int64
│   %5  = Base.getfield(t, 5, true)::Int64
│   %6  = Base.getfield(t, 6, true)::Int64
│   %7  = Base.getfield(t, 7, true)::Int64
│   %8  = Core.tuple(%2, %3, %4, %5, %6, %7)::NTuple{6,Int64}
│   %9  = Base.getfield(t, 8, true)::Int64
│   %10 = Core.tuple(%1, %8, %9)::Tuple{Int64,NTuple{6,Int64},Int64}
└──       return %10
) => Tuple{Int64,NTuple{6,Int64},Int64}
```

This sort of thing is generally useful when you're dealing with functions that return tuples. Often in julia people write things like 
```
julia> t = (1,2,3)
(1, 2, 3)

julia> a, b = t
(1, 2, 3)

julia> a
1

julia> b
2
```
but that's not very nice because in the destructuring step `a, b = t`, there's no way to know if you're throwing away data or not. Having an ability to slurp here would be quite nice because then you don't lose anything in the destructuring.

Ah I see. In that case, here's a non-generated function that can do it in a type stable manner for arbitrarily large `Tuple`s

Although just as what you said, it's antithetical to some goals of MLStyle.

The most flexible class of pattern matching is called first-class pattern matching, in which patterns can be constructed in purely runtime.

function f(pat, x)
    match(pat => ""Ok"", wildcard => ""Error"")(x)

> It's something I ran into a bit with https://github.com/MasonProtter/PatternDispatch.jl which I found rather frustrating.

Could you explain your concerns somewhere and share them with me?

## Issues

First-class pattern matching will have the performance issues and impediments about optimization .

Julia's optimizations for constructing data types are not that advanced so far, hence first-class patterns can introduce a lot of memory allocations and bring notable overhead.

Besides, some performance optimizations for pattern matching is expensive to runtime, and usually used in static languages, so as to have practical first-class patterns in Julia, we have to drop these optimizations.

You mentioned generated patterns

## Advantages

Advantages of first-class patterns are quite charming:
- it needs no compile or macro, so no latency will be observed when using it in REPL
- it looks like a more familiar thing made by multiple dispatch/OOP
- it's more dynamic. So far in MLStyle, the semantics of `@match` is decided once it got compiled/`macroexpend`ed, for a first-class pattern, it can sync up with the code patches. 

## Appendix: PEP 622

So far Python guys are actually introducing first-class patterns, although I don't know if they aware of this fact.

https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0622/#id10

They used to have a `__match__` protocol, you can specify the behavior of `C(a, b, ...)` by providing a proper `C.__match__`.

For patterns like `[1, 2, 3]` or `(1, 2, 3)`, we can refer to `Array.__match__` and `Tuple.__match__`.

It's actually mostly reserved so that macros can use it if they wish (or if Base decides they've found a good use for it), but yeah, I'm not tied to it. I just though it might be nice to offer an alternative to `begin end` and use `{}` instead. I think `@match x pat => result` is fine.

Could be useful, but I think it might be a bit confusing as it's a slightly different meaning than the current match syntax. I think in this case, maybe it'd be better to just make a new macro, i.e.
```julia
@destruct(a, [hd, tl...])
```
which is equivlanent to 
```julia
hd, tl = @match a [hd, tl...] => (hd, tl)

I agree with you.

However MLStyle is already quite big so I want to get rid of introducing new stuffs.

Instead, I hope other packages can leverage MLStyle to do this.

MLStyle already provides the infrastructure for syntax customizations and codegen optimizations.
Instead of only a user interface library, it's also a utility one.

I'll find some time to document how to use MLStyle as a **back end** for higher-level/more user-friendly pattern matching features.

> ```julia

This is a little bit annoying, as there're a lot of self repetition..

MLStyle actually encourages you to write assignment-less code, I hope users could write code like

```julia
@when [hd, tl...] = a begin
    # do some with 'hd' and 'tl'
@otherwise
    # if not matched
end

If you want to match the type, please use `::Float64`.

This is not an error as it's an expected behavior and should be already documented in MLStyle.jl or Match.jl.

The reason why a simple symbol is always used for binding names instead of referencing existing names is,  supporting both semantics will always make the code unreadable. 
**We must make the semantics of a symbol predictable for users.**

See 
- [Capture Patterns](https://thautwarm.github.io/MLStyle.jl/latest/syntax/pattern.html#capturing-patterns)

- [Type Patterns](https://thautwarm.github.io/MLStyle.jl/latest/syntax/pattern.html#type-patterns)


MLStyle did a lot to address the inconvenience caused by this design.

An exception is a pattern object `P` which satisfies `MLStyle.is_enum(P) === true`, in this case, a pattern `P` is equivalent to a pattern `P()`.

Another related thing is the [Reference Patterns](https://thautwarm.github.io/MLStyle.jl/latest/syntax/pattern.html#reference-patterns).

For your use case, if you want to use a pattern `Float64` as the pattern `::Float64`:

```julia
MLStyle.is_enum(::Type{Float64}) == true
function pattern_uncall(::Type{Float64}, self::Function, tparams, targs, args)
    isempty(tparams) && isempty(targs) && isempty(args) || error(""invalid pattern Float64"")
    self(:(::$Float64))

I think we discussed somewhere else (with @thautwarm ), so I believe for symbolic computing (or say just AST search and replace), we still need a more domain-specific pattern match instead of a generic one (like what MLStyle has here). You might want to customize some behavior such as detecting associative and communitive properties. 

I think @HarrisonGrodin implemented a more specific package [Rewrite](https://github.com/HarrisonGrodin/Rewrite.jl) for this purpose, you might want to check as well. 

Regarding to your question how to apply it recursively to the tree, I think you will need to write something like


```jl
function do_somthing(ex::Expr)
      @match $ex begin
                sin($x) => cos($x + 1)
                _ => map(do_something, ex.args)
       end
end
```

but this might currently not be very convenient for manipulating expressions since we cannot sperate rules from match algorithm.",NA,https://api.github.com/repos/thautwarm/MLStyle.jl/issues/81/comments,https://github.com/thautwarm/MLStyle.jl/issues/81#issuecomment-567771475,https://api.github.com/repos/thautwarm/MLStyle.jl/issues/81

> I'm wondering if it is possible to just write 2π without making ambiguity?

It's impossible, I remember we used to discuss about this.

`Expr(:call, 2, :π)` shouldn't match `Expr(:call, 2, π)`, does it make sense?

- `:π` is a pattern to match a symbol `:π`,
- `π` is a pattern to capture the positional value as variable `π`, 
- `&π` is a pattern to match the positional value with the variable `π` in current scope.

IIRC, your question will get answered naturally if you try following codes:

```
x = :x
rhs = [:r1, :r2]
y = [:y1, :y2]
dump(:($x, $(rhs...) = $(y...) ))
dump(:($x, $(rhs...) = $(y...); 1;))
```

Whether it's inconsistent depends your mind(mental model), but anyway the ascription has no concerns to MLStyle(Julia syntax instead).

Due to the expectation of being concise and convenient, Julia discarded a few consistencies, causing ""this inconsistency"", IMAO.

When both LHS and RHS of your assignment is a `Expr(:tuple, ...)`, and you want to deconstruct LHS as `$x, $(rhs...)` and deconstruct RHS as a sequence, this is okay:

```julia
@match stmt begin
   :(($x, $(rhs...)) = ($(y...), )) => (x, rhs, y)

```julia

A couple of things about this are still surprising:

Okay, this is explained in Slack channel, but for the sake of other users' prospective search, I'll explained it again here...

It's caused by the Julia parser,
```julia
julia> dump(:(a -> a))
Expr
  head: Symbol ->    
  args: Array{Any}((2,))
    1: Symbol a
    2: Expr
      head: Symbol block   # <----------------- LOOK HERE OUT!!!
      args: Array{Any}((2,))
        1: LineNumberNode
          line: Int64 1
          file: Symbol REPL[1]
        2: Symbol a
```

Also, if you remove the LineNumberNode of `:(a -> a)`, you can then match it with `:($a -> $b)`...

```julia
julia> using MLStyle

julia> rmlines = @λ begin
           e :: Expr           -> Expr(e.head, filter(x -> x !== nothing, map(rmlines, e.args))...)
             :: LineNumberNode -> nothing
           a                   -> a
       end
#3 (generic function with 1 method)

julia> @match :(a -> a) |> rmlines begin
          :($a -> $b) => (a, b)
       end
(:a, :a)
```

MLStyle AST matching has no hacking, it just takes advantage of the (almost) consistent mapping from Julia syntaxes to their ASTs...

> It's interesting that LamExpr(:a,:b) doesn't work outside @match

That's a bit implementation dependent.
If you want, you can read the following explanation:

> In fact an immutable struct called `LamExpr` is made if nothing called `LamExpr` exists in current scope... The value denoted by `LamExpr` will be registered in the pattern compilation table, which will decide how to compile Julia ASTs into pattern matching codes...

Your understanding of ADT equivalent notations is almost right but not that accurate. Just simply defining some structs will not provide you with the support of pattern matching. Check as_record macro.

It's called the GADT notation, though it's not implememted completely. 
For instance,  given data type(abstract type here) C{T}, I might define a constructor CC to construct C{Vector{A}}, instead of allowing to construct C{T}  forall T via CC.

I'll reformat my post later, and make more detailed explanations.

After pondering for a while, I think there're still some issues.

I hope people could help me with following issues, because Julia programmers' **mental model** is more crucial than the technical parts.

## Issues

1. Conventions among various implementations of pattern matching

In fact, other canonical languages with pattern matching like Haskell, OCaml and F# won't let you match
`1` with `1.0`:

```haskell
case 1 of 1.0 -> 1
```
```ocaml
match 1 with 1.0 -> 1
```

They all failed when compiling, or produced a warning in REPL.

If we allow
```julia
@match 1 begin 1.0 => 1 end
```
in Julia according to `isequal`, it might cause some conflicts against the mainstream design.

However, Scala supports `1 match {1.0 => 1}`, but it's also well-known that pattern matching in Scala is relatively awful.

2. Parametric pattern matching

A constructor might accept a single argument typed `Int` or `Float64`, however, in this case, the `Int` instance is not equivalent to the `Float64` even if they are equivalent according to `isequal`.
 
For instance, pattern matching is super useful in compiler stuffs. We could use [ANF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-normal_form) via MLStyle's `@data`, to represent the constructs of a programming language:

```julia
@data Exp{T} begin
       Value(T)
       ...
end
```
Now, the intermediate representation of integer `1` literal is `Value(1)`, and that of float `1.0` is `Value(1.0)`. However, if we match literal patterns according to `isequal` , pattern `Value(1)` will cover pattern `Value(1.0)`, which will be counterintuitive:

```julia
function mytransformation(ir::Exp{T}) where T
    @match ir begin
      Value(1) =>  ...
      Value(1.0) =>  ...
    end
end
``` 

## Proposals

We can keep literal patterns as simple as possible, and make `Int`(`Int64`), `Float64`, `Char`, `UIntX` or `BigInt` and other Julia grammatical literals solely matchable according to `===`. In this case, we can just ignore the influences from overloading.

We can use the reference pattern/pin operator `@match 1 begin &1.0 => 1 end`, or introduce a specific pattern `IsEqual` to have `@match 1 begin IsEqual(1.0) => 1` . In this case, we can just take advantage of `isequal`.

```julia
x = 10

@match x begin
    10::Float64 => :float
    10::Int => :int
    _ => :no_match
end
```
I guess you could argue this is more natural since it relies on the type syntax Julia users should already be familiar with, rather than having to introduce additional syntax such as `Value`.

This also aligns with how matching seems to work on a Dict currently, it doesn't care if the key is a SubString or a String. 

```julia

d = Dict( k => i for (i , k) in enumerate(split(""a b c"")))

@match d  begin
    Dict(""a"" => a ) =>  :substring_key
    _ => :no_match
end

```

Side note - following this logic I'd expect the following to work but it currently doesn't.

```julia

@match d  begin
    Dict{SubString,Int}(""a"" => a ) =>  :match
    _ => :no_match
end
#LoadError: PatternUnsolvedException
```

Either way I think as long as the documentation mentions if pattern matching is based on `==` or `===`, it's fine.

Hi, some of the Julia 1.1+ versions broke the String equality by `===`(although get fixed since v1.2.0-rc2), and I think it a bit difficult for us to choose `==` or `===` according to Julia versions.

I'm now planning to use `isequal` to compare abstractstrings,  while the speed will get slow down in some cases of using string patterns. e.g, in v1.1.1,
```julia
julia> using BenchmarkTools
julia> a = ""123""
""123""
julia> b = ""123""
""123""
julia> c = ""234""
""234""
julia> @btime a == b
  12.796 ns (0 allocations: 0 bytes)
true
julia> @btime a === b
  6.091 ns (0 allocations: 0 bytes)
true
julia> @btime a == c
  12.992 ns (0 allocations: 0 bytes)
false
julia> @btime a === c
  6.088 ns (0 allocations: 0 bytes)

About your question, the solution is
```julia
@match ast begin
           :(
               function $funcname($(args...))::$out where {$(cov...)}
                   $(block...)
               end
           ) =>
                Dict(:funcname => funcname,
                     :args     => args,
                     :out      => out,
                     :cov      => cov)
end
```
Notice the ` where {$(cov...)}`, it's documented in Julia official docs:
https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/metaprogramming/#Splatting-interpolation-1

Any time you feel confused about MLStyle,jl, just remember it just help you to **destruct/deconstruct things just as how they're constructed**:

```julia
where_vars = [:x, :y]
ast =  :(
             function f(a::Int, b::Float16, d::T)::Int128 where {$(where_vars...)}
                   let d = a + b + c, e = x -> 2x + d
                      e(d)
                   end
             end
        )

@match ast begin
           :(
              function $funcname($(args...))::$out where {$(cov...)}
                   $(block...)
              end
            ) => where_vars == cov
 end # => true
```

Additionally, the AST of 
```julia
function f() where {}
end
```
is not same as
```julia
function f()
end
```
, although they're the same in semantics. You can use `dump` to verify this fact.

And a useful feature you might like to know is the `Or-pattern`,
```julia
f1node = :(function f() where {}; end)
f2node = :(function f() where T; end)
f3node = :(function f() where {T1, T2}; end)


extract_where(node) = @match node begin

I have some issues with this: https://github.com/thautwarm/MLStyle.jl/pull/56/files#diff-d4c083746da5bfbc6b58f97dfca75141R104

Why this

instead of
```julia
     @when (a, 1) = x begin
                a
      @when (b, 2) = x

      @when (c, 3) = x
                (:c, c)
      end
```

It seems that your implementation of `@when` is covered by `@match`.

The reason why we  need `@when` other than the sole `@match` is, a value to match always corresponds to many patterns/cases but there're some use cases that multiple values to match correspond to only one/multiple patterns.",NA,https://api.github.com/repos/thautwarm/MLStyle.jl/issues/56/comments,https://github.com/thautwarm/MLStyle.jl/pull/56#issuecomment-488314987,https://api.github.com/repos/thautwarm/MLStyle.jl/issues/56

My style of ast manipulation comes from such a point of view: macros are just functions, each of which map an AST to another AST.

I think you might be talking about the `@format`, `format`, `render` defined in MLStyle.Render?.It provides a handy way to substitute ASTs in runtime.

Take care about `$args...`, in fact it's incorrect. You codes could be fixed with

           function go(ast)

                   Expr(:call, f, args...) => branch(f, map(go, args))

**Q**: when to use `@match` vs `@matchast`
**A**: If you prefer to use a syntactic way(`:($f($x)) => ...`) to match asts instead of a constructive way(`Expr(:call, f, x) => ...`), and you don't want to write the first layer of AST quotation(`:(...)`),  you should use `@matchast`. Here is a pair example about `@matchast` and `@match`.

```julia
@match :(a + b) begin
    :($a + $b) => (a, b)
    _ => nothing
end
# which is equivalent to
@matchast :(a + b) quote
    $a + $b => (a, b)
   _ => nothing
end
```
**Q**: when do patterns need to be quoted (:(Expr(:call, $f, $args...)) above, though seem to indicate unquoted should work?
**A**: The patterns should quoted only if you want to match expressions/ASTs in a syntactic manner. Furthermore, in patterns, a `$` is exactly a reverse operation to quotations:
```julia
@match 1 begin
   :($a) => a
end # 1
@match :(a + 1) begin
   :(a + $(::Int)) => true
   _ => false

I directly used `@match`  in the generated code of  `@λ`,  which made `@match` necessary for the callee of any macro that invoke `@λ`.  That's too bad  for  `@λ` is not totally unusable!

However, in the following days(about one week) I have no time to fix this extremely important issue. Could you please help me with this? I think it won't cost much time, just avoid macrocalls inside quote expressions and, export corresponding function implementations `gen_lambda`, `gen_match`, `gen_when` for macros `@λ`, `@match`, `@when`, respectively.

Taking something like Jon Harrop's benchmark here: http://flyingfrogblog.blogspot.com/2017/12/does-reference-counting-really-use-less_26.html


That would give a good order-of-magnitude estimate. That benchmark is also technically a benchmark of GC performance (with no cheating using pools for non GCed languages, unlike the shootout).

I'm on your side but recently I won't make benchmark comparisons with other languages for it's extremely time consuming.

The concept of `if-let` in Clojure might be better than Rust, I think, for it can accept not only a term of pattern matching but a normal bool expression is also valid.

So what's your ideal `if-let` syntax in Julia? @Roger-luo  prefers keyword `when`, and so am I, but I'd admit that this could be personal preference(maybe `if` causes the aesthetic fatigue for its frequently regular usage).",NA,https://api.github.com/repos/thautwarm/MLStyle.jl/issues/11/comments,https://github.com/thautwarm/MLStyle.jl/issues/11#issuecomment-414197653,https://api.github.com/repos/thautwarm/MLStyle.jl/issues/11

First in your startup.cs enable buffering in your config. This is for .net core 3.1, if you have something else, try here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40494913/how-to-read-request-body-in-an-asp-net-core-webapi-controller

                context.Request.EnableBuffering();
                return next();
            });
```

Then you'll need a verification method like so:

```
  private static async Task<bool> ValidateRequest(HttpRequest request, SkillRequest skillRequest)
        {
            request.Headers.TryGetValue(""SignatureCertChainUrl"", out var signatureChainUrl);

            catch
            {
                Trace.TraceError($""Validation failed. SignatureChainUrl not valid: {signatureChainUrl}"");
                return false;
            }

            request.Headers.TryGetValue(""Signature"", out var signature);
            if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(signature))
            {

            {
                body = stream.ReadToEnd();
            }

            if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(body))
            {
                Trace.TraceError(""Validation failed - the JSON is empty"");
                return false;
            }

            bool isTimestampValid = RequestVerification.RequestTimestampWithinTolerance(skillRequest);
            bool valid = await RequestVerification.Verify(signature, certUrl, body);

            if (!valid || !isTimestampValid)
            {
                Trace.TraceError(""Validation failed - RequestVerification failed"");
                return false;
            }
            else
            {
                return true;
            }
        }
```
 
Finally, at the start of your handle request. Get the HttpRequest out of the HttpContext

```
        [HttpPost]
        public ActionResult<SkillResponse> HandleRequest([FromBody] SkillRequest skillRequest) {
            var request = HttpContext.Request;

            bool isValid = AlexaController.ValidateRequest(request, skillRequest).Result;
            if (!isValid)
            {
                return new BadRequestResult();
            }
....
```

Sorry if I wasn't clear - I didn't mean an exact copy and paste of the code. More that we have several instances in our libraries of a converter mechanism where you can register extensions - similar to that of Request. In this case something like `Func<JObject,IConnectionTask>` that returned the first non-null value would allow for a better experience overall.

The issue I have with dropping it to `object` is you lose any strong typing without the converter, JSON.Net will make it a JObject and you're back to magic strings or manually mapping your data - for anyone using the built in types (or their own where they've just added the two properties to get around the problem) that's a really bad experience.

This means the error you'll see from the Lambda is going to return an AggregateException. If you examine that error it will have an InnerExceptions property with the ""real"" error in it (there is a way to flatten these errors in Lambda, but I can't remember how you get that to happen)

You need to wrap the code that's causing the problem in a try...catch block so you can catch the NullReferenceException, and return a response correctly. I assume this is an Alexa skill Lambda? So maybe your code just returns null and higher up you say if the value is null you produce a different `ResponseBuilder.Tell`?

Certain ones (like management) just couldn't because they rely on other 3rd party assemblies that aren't.

My concern is that if I do that for this version, doesn't that mean they all break again when we release the next one with a similar version mismatch to what we have now? I'd be artificially bumping them all every time the main library changed version - developers would have to keep everything in step to work properly and we'd be complicating the majority of implementations.

Looking around the problem I've seen several .StrongNamed suffix assemblies for those that need it (not many still supported, but still). If the main library did that I could work with getting a similar convention sorted for the extensions - developers have a choice at least and the majority stay with NuGet working as expected.

If you're not getting a response though, that points me more to an exception being raised - maybe put a try catch around the initial call to validate request, and return a BadRequestResult if you get an exception?

I know we have others who rely on this for their skills to work correctly and have reached out before - so I'm hoping it's something specific we can track down 🤞

Like-for-like changes aside, the really big issue seems to be that the JsonConverter attribute in System.Text.Json can't be applied to interfaces - which is something we really rely on for the polymorphism. Even with custom converters applied to the serializer options it deserializes them properly, but doesn't serialize an interface properly (won't serialize the properties that are only in that specific inmplementation - only the interface definition itself)

I've not looked into how that would work but I'm guessing extensive use of compiler switches to ensure only the right attributes were applied to every class and property? That's a lot of maintenance (or possible a single subclassed attribute that isolates and hide the compiler switch maybe? _adds to list of things to look at)

It's also the upstream issue; although I appreciate it's not exclusive - our primary use case is AWS Lambda and that's not available in a .NET 3.1 runtime flavour yet without custom layers. Also the LambdaSerializer supported by Amazon is one based on Newtonsoft - so we'd have to customise that too.

You would need to show me a failing request for me to be able to help.

Regardless the possible options are limited, and most likely you're receiving a CountryInfo intent, with no value in the Country Slot.

Slots are not guaranteed by default, they just aid the machine learning in modelling what to look for as most likely values.

If you want a guaranteed value, I would suggest updating your skill to use Slot Validation - which you can find out about here:

And, as I've said, I don't think the problem _is_ your code, but the request you're getting.

You can log the request in cloudwatch by setting an environmental variable on your lambda. the variable name is `LAMBDA_NET_SERIALIZER_DEBUG` and the value needs to be `true`

When this is on your lambda, if you make a request that fails, the JSON that your lambda got sent will appear in the Cloudwatch logs, and you can see the whole request - not just the error.

Without that there's not much more we can do I'm afraid.

What you can see though is that you're getting `AMAZON.FallbackIntent` - which is what you receive when what the user has says doesn't match any of your intents. So there are no slots, which mean your code will break if it assumes the slot value exists.

What you need is to ensure you only run your code when it's your `Country` intent that's been invoked. Something like `if(intentRequest.Intent.Name == 'Country')` or whatever works for your skill

If you're creating the object in isolation the constructor is so small there's no value from an operator, and part of the library benefit is it helps you learn the request/response syntax so it's easier to read in Amazon's tools which are almost always raw JSON - reprompt is an object you see all the time.

In terms of ""awesomeness"", operators can definitely deliver - the two instances Alexa.NET has of implicit operators currently:

IntentSignature - Amazon give us the signature as a string, so I didn't really want to complicate the JSON conversion, but there was little benefit to the string without the ability to parse it out into an object model to expose the detail to the developer. Still unsure this was the right call compared to a .Parse method on the object.
https://github.com/timheuer/alexa-skills-dotnet/blob/master/Alexa.NET/Request/IntentSignature.cs

APLValue in Alexa.NET.APL - the APL library relies heavily on implicit conversion; every property in every object can be either a specific type or a data binding string, so with no union types in .NET constructing objects was painful. To make the library usable for all but the most simple example, I added implicit operators to handle my ""value"" object

1) Leave everything the same and abandon the PR

APL and body templates are two different techniques to rendering data on screen; with APL being the preferred mechanism from Amazon these days due to its increased flexibility - but they don't work in conjunction with one another.

If you're using body templates, then the data has to come from filling in the fields in the template and attaching that to the render template directive.

If you're using APL then the main template has a ""payload"" parameter - and that refers to the data sources tab in the designer, so all your fields will be of the style  `${payload.dataSourceName.fieldName}`

If you want to have support for APL within Alexa.NET skills - then that's available through the Alexa.NET.APL NuGet package at https://github.com/stoiveyp/Alexa.NET.APL and you can use the RenderDocument directive, which has a data sources property in it for your data.

Thank you for the reply and the useful information. After reading your message I realize I was mixing the two and in fact what we have been using is just the body templates which I am now assuming was the precursor to APL.

I'll work on setting up a test using the RenderDocument directive and see if we can figure out how to get that working. If you don't mind one more naive question... When you use the Alexa developer authoring tool where is the actual template JSON and how do you send that with the RenderDocument directive?  It makes sense that the data is referenced in a payload parameter but I'm not understanding where the actual template definition resides.

Once you have a template you're happy with - that template needs to be copied/saved out of the designer and stored somewhere the skill can access it (S3 bucket, local file etc). This can then be used to deserialize the JSON into a Document object that can be used with the directive.

Thanks again for the guidance provided in the thread above. We have included the Alexa.NET.APL NuGet and made some progress on supporting APL.  It seems a lot can change in a day as the Amazon looks to have recently been updated and the toggle button replaced with a left-side menu 🙂.

After creating some APL we are running into problems trying to deserialize it into a RenderDocumentDirective using code like the following.

```
RenderDocumentDirective directive = new RenderDocumentDirective();
directive.Document = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<APLDocument>(apl);
```

Most of our errors seem to be coming from the onMount and/or the commands under the onMount. Not sure if something has changed recently but the specification seems to indicate that onMount is an array containing objects that would have type, commands, finally, etc. as children. We get exceptions like the following when using what looks to be properly formatted JSON for the onMount value.

`Error setting value to 'OnMount' on 'Alexa.NET.Response.APL.APLDocument'.`

It also seems that it should be acceptable to simple include a blank array for onMount but when we simply try and include a blank array """"onMount"": [],"" we get an exception saying ""Value cannot be null. Parameter name: key"" during the deserialization.

Should we be able to deserialize from APL taken from the authoring tool and create a RenderDocumentDirective object?

Thanks.

I know we've had issue with Azure Functions and customConverters before, but not with that kind of code example. First of all, can I confirm you're on the latest version of Alexa.NET? If so... 

The error is ours - https://github.com/timheuer/alexa-skills-dotnet/blob/master/Alexa.NET/Request/Type/RequestConverter.cs#L49

But the code to handle System.ExceptionEncountered is here:
https://github.com/timheuer/alexa-skills-dotnet/blob/master/Alexa.NET/Request/Type/Converters/DefaultRequestTypeConverter.cs#L20

So it should be finding the converter. Makes me think it might be something to do with the static setup of the JsonConverters. Hmm... 

Are you able to use Function model binding to set the request instead? See if that helps the issue go away? Got an old example here - but I believe the syntax for the function argument is still good?

I wanted to get this pr out soon while my use case issue is fresh in my mind.

I can certainly retool most of those tests to deserialize directly against the example json documents. I agree that is probably the better solution. I'll get that under review in another commit sometime shortly.

One other nagging question for me is the public api for registering new response converters from other consumers. For instance I believe your own skills purchasing nuget needs to register new request types and I believe there are special subscription directives that would want to be handled for response deserialization.

Currently the dead simple way was a public static dictionary containing string -> delegate pairs to obtain a stub object for Newtonsoft.Json to complete the deserialization. If you are happy with that api surface we can go with it otherwise I was toying with the idea of registering new converters perhaps with a similar api as the `RequestConverter.RequestConverters`.

Here is the Json that Alexa Console is sending to the lambda (I got it from from the Alexa's log). 

When I tested the lambda function with this JSON, it shows the error I copied in the first posts.

By the way, thanks for your support guys ;).

If you scroll to the top of the screen, or uncheck the Device Log and Device Display boxes at the top of the screen, you should see a section labelled ""Skill I/O"" - which is the JSON that is sent to your Lambda by an Alexa skill, and should look like the screenshot below.

The session attributes are a dictionary object - so you can use `session.Remove(key)` to remove an item from an active session object.

Also, the response session and the request session can be different, so you can do something like 
```csharp
var session = new Session();
session.Attributes = new Dictionary<string,object>();
session.Attributes.Add(justOneKey,justOneValue);
response.SessionAttributes = session;

The reason it's bad practice is because it's not a valid SkillRequest, so the correct response is an exception - stopping the flow of the code and ensuring valid logic isn't run for something that shouldn't be allowed.

The issue you have is that you're trying to allow an invalid request - which shouldn't be able to happen, and isn't something the package should force every developer to deal with, so as it's a specific use case - you'll have to handle it locally, rather than making it a problem all users of the package will have to be aware of.

I understand your point of view and respect it....

**BUT**

Personally I find it a bit weird. As the consumer of your package I haven't expected a NULL-AlexaSkillRequest, only because the request in the JSON is empty. The first thing that came to my mind ""is the web api serialization not working?"", but it would never come to my mind, that the request is only partially malformed  / partially invalid.

Like I said, I would have expected an deserialization-exception / NULL-property instead.
But I guess thats not your problem anymore, I guess it's inside Microsoft-code, where the exception is supressed....

**Let me be a bit evil now, I could argue like the following:**

There is a version in every valid alexa request, isn't there? Something like? `""version"": ""1.0""`.

When I delete the version from the json and try to deserialize into your object, every other property is filled properly BUT the version, even though, it's partially malformed and not legit, is it? So whats the difference between leaving out the version (or maybe even the whole session) and leaving out some stuff from the request?

Rather than turning the field into a string and allowing JSON.NET to put any possible value in there, we changed the converter to allow a mix of the two date time formats. This way the correct information (a valid date) was still placed in the request - and invalid date formats caused an exception.

We work within the realm of what JSON.Net lets us do, and sometimes it's a judgement call. But this argument can absolutely be applied to all packages - some people, I'm sure, don't want a FileNotFoundException when System.IO can't find a file and would prefer a null return - but you do what you believe adheres to the best rules for the majority of the consumers and best practice within .NET, there's always a case where it doesn't fit exactly, and that's part of open source.

And actually, that's a good time to mention that our licence allows you to fork and alter this default logic without any repercussions (something I've stuck to with all the Alexa.Net extensions too) so you're absolutely able to make it work specifically for you without any concern.

Unless there's more code to be submitted - I suggest we close this PR, as I believe the decision has been thoroughly discussed and we're now having a more general conversation about package maintenance, which I think is best put into an issue if we want to carry on.

To help with async/await I've written out the flow below:

- Start Timer 1 45 second delay
- Start Timer 15 second delay
- Wait until either timer or timer1 completes
- Timer 15 second timer completes
- Progressive Response sends ""working on it""
- Handle sends ""I'm done""
- Timer1 may or may not complete, depending on when task is terminated.

In this instance you know you have a minimum of 15 seconds to wait before you can respond correctly, so by all means start timer and timer1 (you want them completing ASAP), but then send the progressive response to give feedback to the user that their command has been understood. 

So you'll end up with (I changed the progressive response slightly to show that the user now knows it's okay that they're waiting)

```csharp
 var tasks = new List<Task<bool>>{ Timer1(), Timer() };

if (_progressiveResponse.CanSend())
    await _progressiveResponse.SendSpeech(""I'm working on it, I'll just be a few more seconds"");

await Task.WhenAny(tasks);
```

Alternatively, if you know one task will always complete faster than the other:

```csharp
var timerTask = Timer();
var timer1Task = Timer1();

if (_progressiveResponse.CanSend())
    await _progressiveResponse.SendSpeech(""I'm working on it, I'll just be a few more seconds"");

await timerTask;

if (_progressiveResponse.CanSend())
    await _progressiveResponse.SendSpeech(""It's going to be worth the wait, just a little longer"");

await timer1Task
```

If you know your task _has_ to take a long time, I'd recommend taking advantage of the fact that you can send up to five progressive response commands to ensure your user is being regularly communicated with - as long periods of silence will make them feel that the skill has failed or stopped.

```csharp
 var tasks = new List<Task<bool>>{ Timer1(), Timer() };

if (_progressiveResponse.CanSend())
{
    var progress1 = _progressiveResponse.SendSpeech(""I'm working on it, I'll just be a few more seconds"");
    await Task.WhenAll(progress1, Task.Delay(7));
    var progress2 = _pressiveResponse.SendSpeech(""Almost there, totally worth the wait"");
    await Task.WhenAll(progress2, Task.Delay(7));
}

await Task.WhenAny(tasks);
```
If you don't know how long the real task will take then you could do a loop that does the same thing, and keeps sending them until either there's been 5 progressive responses or the task has completed.

Also - WhenAny means that only one of the two tasks needs to complete - is that correct? If both need to complete then use `.WhenAll`. If not then the cancellationtoken probably needs to be used after one of them has completed to cancel the other.

A long explanation but hopefully it helps explain things and progressive response isn't something a lot of people use - but I think it's a great way of ensuring customer engagement for those operations you can't avoid taking a little time.

1. You need to have a token set for the stream object, it's a required field for the interface
2. ShouldEndSession should be set to true, otherwise it won't play the audio (it will pause it waiting for a user response)

In your second line `(incomingRequest.Request as IntentRequest)` will produce a null output for LaunchRequest objects, or anything other than an intent. This means the `.Intent.Name` part of the statement will be against a null object and generate a NullReferenceException

I'd move that line to inside the case statement for IntentRequest and remove the subsequent line, as you already have an intentRequest being generated with the statement `case IntentRequest intent`

Due to the way we deserialize Alexa requests, there isn't a scenario I'm aware of where using the base Request object would generate a valid representation of a skill request.

Can I ask which request type you're getting back from Alexa which is causing this issue for you? Or a snippet of the JSON you're receiving (anonymised of course) would be even more helpful.

To work around this, I did the following

`SkillRequest input = await req.Content.ReadAsAsync<SkillRequest>();`

Here's a loose sample...

~~~~ 
      [FunctionName(""AlexaSkill)]
        public static async Task<IActionResult> Run([HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Function, ""get"", ""post"", Route = null)]HttpRequestMessage req, ILogger log)
        {
            log.LogInformation(""C# HTTP trigger function processed a request."");

            // Get to the content
            SkillRequest input = await req.Content.ReadAsAsync<SkillRequest>();

            string responseMessage = """";

            switch (input.Request)
            {
                case LaunchRequest launch:
                    responseMessage = @""Welcome to the Machine"";
                    break;
                case IntentRequest intent:
                    switch (intent.Intent.Name)
                    {
                        case BuiltInIntent.Cancel:
                        case BuiltInIntent.Stop:
                            //blah blah

Yes I believe so - all I'm doing right now is taking the JSON the Alexa Skills Kit Developer Console is generating and using that in Postman to test my api locally.

Here's the exact JSON I'm trying to send to my local endpoint for testing. Am I wrong in assuming I should just be able to throw `SkillRequest` as a parameter on the controller and get a strongly type `SkillRequest` object?

The real usecase wouldn't be ""Fruits"", it was just to make the example a bit more clear. :)

To be a bit more specific:
I choose a city and in each city I have up to five special places I would like to choose from.
Those 5 places can be anything, it's just a dynamic string which I have no influence on.

So in order to get to know those places I first have the user select the city, so I can limit all the place opportunitys to a maximum of five places. So, a known list is not possible, cause it is very dynamic.

If you were sure you only wanted one intent? You could create a slot for the numbered results, and not include it in the intent phrases.

thanks. 

I don't like to use two  intents,  because it's very unnatural for me to have to say  a whole sentence instead of just a number,  so the second intend is called,  after I told alexa my city and date. Further more there's the risk,  that the second intent Is called before the first one,  isn't it? I don't know,  I just started learning to build skills, and I find to have a good design is very important.  :) 

Anyways,  you told me to build a ""response with the 
list data and  use the elicit directive"" for the numbers,  but I'm not sure you mean by that.  
If you have 5 minutes I'd love to see a very quick  example.

I am trying to save the session details. If I have to switch the intent from one intent to other intent based on session attributes, How can i change the slot type for dialog delegation to match to the switched intent?

Ex:
intent_name = pinintent {slot name = pin}
 
now based on the session attributes i have to change the intent name, say Inquiry
intent_name = inquiryintent {slot name = inquiry slot}

If i have to use dialog delegate, i have to change slot ""pin"" to ""inquiry slot"" and name to 'intent_name' to handle the delegation.

Can i change SkillRequest Object after i receive, to process my needs? If so Please let me know the approach?

Couple of things I'd like to check before we get into specifics.

First of all, does your code keep sending back a DialogDelegate until all the slots are filled?

Your skill will receive an intent request after a DialogDelegate response has asked for the next empty slot. Your skill will need to check each time if there are still slots to fill, and send another DialogDelegate if there are any missing. This loop needs to continue until all the slots are filled in.

If you already have this loop, is your skill sending back an updated intent with the DialogDelegate? Although optional, without the updated intent object in the response, Alexa won't keep track of any updated slots and the skill ends up with previously answered questions being returned as empty next time around.

Let me know about these two areas and if everything checks out we can get into some specifics.",NA,https://api.github.com/repos/timheuer/alexa-skills-dotnet/issues/66/comments,https://github.com/timheuer/alexa-skills-dotnet/issues/66#issuecomment-348830456,https://api.github.com/repos/timheuer/alexa-skills-dotnet/issues/66

I'll describe what I have so far and where I am stuck:

- I ask my skill: ""Put foo in bar""
- The skill receives the `RelationshipIntent` with both slots `thing` and `parent` filled with `foo` and `bar` respectively
  - If I ask something like ""Manage a relationship"" it receives the intent with both slots empty, so it sends `DialogDelegate`s and asks the user until both slots are filled.
- It queries a DynamoDB table if `foo` and `bar` both exist
  - If they exist, it puts the relationship in and answers: `bar is now the parent of foo`.
  - If one or both don't exist, it puts three commands onto a list in the session (Create `foo`, create `bar`, make `bar` a parent of `foo`)
  - Then, it says something like `foo and bar do not exist. Do you want me to create them?`
  - If I answer ""yes"", it goes into the `YesIntent`, gets the first command from the list (which is ""Create `foo`"" in this example)
  - Now, I want to forge a `NewThing` intent with the `thing` slot filled accordingly, and delegate to it, as if I asked the skill ""Create foo""

And at this point I am stuck. I even created a simple skill which has the intents `Foo` and `Bar`, and if I say `Foo` it should redirect to the `Bar` intent, but my Echo still answers with ""There was a problem with the skill"". When I test it in the Alexa management console, I *do* get a JSON object back that looks like it is the correct `Bar` skill.

Here is what I do (it is F# code with some shortcuts thrown in, but I verified that they work as intended):

```fsharp
let intent = new Intent()
intent.Slots <- new Dictionary<string, Slot>()
let slots = intent.Slots
match nextTask with
| NewThing thing ->
	intent.Name <- ""NewThing""
	let slot = new Slot()
	slot.Name <- ""thing""
	slot.Value <- thing
	slots.Add(""thing"", slot)
| // others
let attribs = session
			  |> attribs
			  |> Map.remove ""yes"" // This was the list of new commands that got in here on the ""yes""
			  // pendingTasks is just a list of tasks to fulfill later. box puts them into a System.Object
			  // so I can serialize them with JSON.net
			  // I am doing this explicitly because deserializing does not always discover the correct
			  // object I want to have
			  |> Map.add ""pending"" (pendingTasks |> box |> JsonConvert.SerializeObject |> box)
session.Attributes <- new Dictionary<string, obj>(attribs |> Map.toSeq |> dict)

So for the Display.ElementSelected event it's a new request type, so you can add it to the logic in your skill that determines what action to take. Something like this should work:

```csharp            
switch (skillRequest.Request)
{
    case DisplayElementSelectedRequest element:
    var token = element.Token;
    //TODO: Perform logic here
    break;
}
```
For body and list templates you use the new DisplayRenderTemplateDirective class, add your template to that, and attach that to your response before returning a value from your skill. Something like the following

```csharp
            var template = new BodyTemplate1
            {
                Title = ""Test Title"",
                Token = ""BodyTemplate"",
                Content = new TemplateContent
                {
                    Primary = new TemplateText {Text = ""This is primary text""},
                    Secondary = new TemplateText {Text = ""This is secondary text""}
                }
            };

            var response = ResponseBuilder.Tell(""This is the speech Alexa will use"");
            response.Response.Directives.Add(new DisplayRenderTemplateDirective{Template=template});
```

For a more complete set of template examples, you might want to check out the repository [Display Tests](https://github.com/timheuer/alexa-skills-dotnet/blob/master/Alexa.NET.Tests/RenderTemplateTests.cs)

Unfortunately I don't have a full working sample - simply because I've yet to get hold of a device that honours the Display Directive, but the library adheres to the document definition supplied by Amazon.

Please, if you have any other questions please don't hesitate to ask.

The issue I had when I was working with the dialogs was not sending back the updated intent and thinking the state was being kept by Alexa.

Alexa skills don't keep track of the intent for you, the intent request receives the state that the intent is currently in, allows you to manipulate or fill in the blanks if you can, then you have to send it back as part of the dialog delegate - otherwise you end up with a blank intent again and Alexa starts from scratch; The dialog delegate and elicit slot responses just give you a way of asking for the information based on dialog configuration rather than having to build that speech directly into the skill code.

The Dialog.Delegate it's talking about is a directive in the JSON, in this case generated using the DialogDelegateDirective class in the Alexa.NET code, which is what the ResponseBuilder.DialogDelegate method is doing with the information you send it.

That's a general overview to help with how it's supposed to work, but when you say it doesn't work - is it that it's not filling in the slots properly (a sign of needing an updated intent as described) or are you getting a specific error back?

aware that session management needs to be done by your code.

To answer your question. My code which tries to delegate slot collection to
Alexa is this :

        public SkillResponse FunctionHandler(SkillRequest input,
ILambdaContext context)
        {

            var requestType = input.GetRequestType();
            if (requestType == typeof(IntentRequest))
            {
                var intentRequest = input.Request as IntentRequest;

                // The intentRequest variable here is the IntentRequest
object sent to the skill.
                if (intentRequest.DialogState == DialogState.Started)
                {
                    // Pre-fill slots: update the intent object with slot
values for which
                    // you have defaults, then return Dialog.Delegate with
this updated intent
                    // in the updatedIntent property.
                    return ResponseBuilder.DialogDelegate(input.Session);
                }
                else if (intentRequest.DialogState != DialogState.Completed)
                {
                    return ResponseBuilder.DialogDelegate(input.Session);
                    // return a Dialog.Delegate directive with no
updatedIntent property.
                }
                else
                {
                    // Dialog is now complete and all required slots should
be filled,
                    // so call your normal intent handler.
                    var location =
intentRequest.Intent.Slots[""Location""].Value;
                        return MakeSkillResponse(
                            $""You would like to find a house in the area
{location}"",
                            true);
                }

            }
            else
            {
                return MakeSkillResponse(
                        $""I don't know how to handle this intent. Please
say something like Alexa, ask {INVOCATION_NAME} find a home in Dallas."",
                        true);
            }
        }

And the response if I test the Lambda is. It is weird. Because the
directives are empty. Plus I don't get where the template is coming from.
When I test this using Alexa she just blows up saying I got an unexpected
response.

  ""version"": ""1.0"",

    ""speechletResponse"": {

              ""text"": ""<big>House Hunter</big>""
            }
          }
        }
      ],
      ""shouldEndSession"": false
    }
  },

As .NetStandard is the most portable profile for interoperability between .Net runtimes.  .NetCore is very far from a replacement of .NetFull and it still does not work fully under Mono. With the project being under .NetStandard (compatible as a PCL library) we can use existing tooling and environments.

It's a quill. I added that as the name ""Alexa"" comes from the Great Library of Alexandria. The icon doesn't need to represent anything, we can create meaning - Alexa is already an abstract ideal anyway. e.g. https://github.com/Fody/Fody

No version of .Net works fully under Mono as it is incomplete, hence why its proving hard work making Umbraco work on it, however making the Umbraco.Core run cross platform has been achieved rather easily and it works as expected on .NetCore on Linux. I would lean on the side of building on top of .NetCore as the framework but support .NetStandard as the standard & any issues with it running on Linux etc be raised at the appropriate locations since the target of Microsoft is now to make it work entirely as expected cross-platform, it is essentially the next level replacement & therefore if building something new which could be rather underpinning as a library then it should be as future-proof as possible by considering the big picture :)

That would disregard 99% of the .Net ecosystem. .NetStandard is the replacement of the PCL's which run under the .NetCore and .NetFull runtimes.

- I think unlikely people want more than the two. If so, can add ""other"" feature again later

Example: `C:\Users\MyUser\Desktop\Project`

However, on Windows, the single backslash character `\` is special. It's used to insert special symbols.

Example: `This is on line one\nThis is line two` would be rendered as:

```
This is on line one
This is line two
```

Since a `\n` is replaced with a new line character.

Single slashes are simply automatically removed if they aren't followed by one of the key letters it's looking for.

Hence why `C:\Users\MyUser\Desktop\Project` might turn into `C:UsersMyUserDesktopProject`

Thus, you want to use the special character `\\` to create a single backslash.

Yeah as far as I know you can't do this as the textmate engine relies on the native oniguruma regex library. You could do it if you had a server that could run the native lib of course but that's a little more tricky.

Another issue with a web-based interface is you need more files than just the json to actually publish the extension.

The first iteration of course wouldn't support direct publishing of theme extensions to the market place. What I had in mind was simply a theme.json as output, which then could be published manually.

First iteration would be really simple, just a bunch of color pickers to pick the basic colors, plus the option to fine tune the other rules, just like you do it in the demo folder with the sapphire theme. Would've been easy enough to implement, except for the preview part... also I'm not exactly sure how running oniguruma on a server would help here. In the end the preview would be just a bunch of HTML and CSS.

Anyway, implementing something server side would go beyond the scope of my available time.

Screenshots don't always display all colors, so having a combination of color squares and a screenshot might be a nice combo.

I quickly threw this together after I put my daughter to bed. In the themes I was working with, I didn't have an easy list of the color codes. I just wrote this in PowerShell, so I'd assume there has to be something similar in js. The better way to do it would likely be to take the colors as input instead, so $Green instead $CommentColor etc. The one issue with this, is I am just creating a bitmap and replacing the text colors, so it isn't a real screenshot of the theme in Code. 

I am also not 100% sure how the colors translate to PowerShell, so the colors I used might not be totally correct, but I was just wanting to kind of make an example.

So in the document I have the following:

``` html

This appears in the output of the blog post itself just fine. However, on the index of the blog (i.e. if I put that video before `.. more::`), it will become the following:

``` html
<iframe width=""640"" height=""480"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/xx"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen=""""/>

Firefox is then not able to cope with the HTML and does not display anything beyond that. For me the fix is to have no videos before `.. more::`, but that is a bit sad as I would like to show the video up front.

Take a look at `tinkerer/themes/boilerplate/layout.html`. If you want a richer tagline, you can currently create a new `_template/layout.html` in your blog, have that inherit from the theme's `layout.html`, and override the `header` block.

You should have something like this in the `_templates/layout.html` of your blog:

```
{%- extends ""!layout.html"" -%}

{%- block header -%}
    <header role=""banner"">
        <hgroup>
            <h1><a href=""{{ pathto(pages[0][0]) }}"">{{ shorttitle|e }}</a></h1>
            --> Add whatever you like here <--
        </hgroup>
    </header>
{% endblock -%}
```

This is pretty much the header block from `layout.html`, with the tagline replaced by whatever you want to put in there. Tinkerer is doing something similar with the `page.html` template for the Tinkerer blog (at http://tinkerer.me). Take a look at `/blog/_templates/page.html` for this project.

I have to think a bit about what would be the best way to more easily enable this. reStructuredText might be trickier because of the way Sphinx works (though I guess we could go directly to docutils for this instead of Sphinx). Raw html might cause other issues, as it would bypass escaping which we get for free now from Jinja. If we would pass in raw html, taglines containing characters like `<`, `>` etc. would break the html.

I do agree with you that richer tagline should be easier to achieve, but I want to make sure it's done right. Hopefully the steps above will work for you, and I'll think some more about the best way this can be achieved.

BTW, it appears the CI build fails, probably because you don't have permissions on the Travis server to start an http server instance. Please check the ""failed"" notice on the bottom of your pull request description.

- Internalizing the server functionality gives Tinkerer a more <del>civilized reputation</del> polished presentation when compared with other blog hosting software (or at least keeps it on par with others)
- The command to run the server is easier to remember (although the batch/shell script couldn't be that hard)
- It makes testing/developing new themes easier
- Tinkerer ensures that I start the server from the base directory, same as almost everything else
- It can take multiple simultaneous requests due to the use of the ThreadingMixin from the SocketServer module

I took a look at the CI build failed notice on Travis. It appears it failed only in the Python2.6 environment, which I subsequently ran successfully on my local box. The Python2.7 and Python3 environments completed without a problem. I suspect the build box was still spinning up the server when the request for the page was issued and the request was not answered. I have introduced a time delay in the test to mitigate errors of this sort. If it continues I will be glad to look into it further.

Thanks for considering this change.

Those components will not be loaded and cannot be previewed to see the full impact of the page, without serving them. Having a simple way to serve the blog locally would allow users the ability to use Javascript in their blogs. It would also allow the use of page scaffolding toolkits for the blog layout such as Bootstrap or HTML5 Boilerplate. Maybe I am trying to expand the initial intent of Tinkerer.

Tinkerer is meant to be a static blog file generator - think Octopress. The idea is you write your blog in RST format, you build it, and end up with a bunch of html files which you can host on places like BitBucket, GitHub or anywhere else for that matter. RST is great and Sphinx is an awesome tool but it was built for writing documentation not blogging. Tinkerer tries to close that gap by providing a set of extensions and tooling to allow blog building with the Sphinx engine.

Neither Sphinx nor Tinkerer have anything to do with the way you decide to serve the built files.

While I don't deny that it might be useful to quickly spin up a server to locally preview Tinkerer served over HTTP, I don't believe this should be part of the core translating-RST-into-a-blog functionality. You could definitely contribute this as an external tool that can serve the blog, but not part of Tinkerer core. You can either put it on PyPI or pull it to tinkerer-contrib repository, but I'd rather have it as a standalone.

There are some issues, still:
1. Translations must be updated, because Babel uses a different formatting language than `.strftime`.  Should be easy though, since the mapping from `.strftime` to Babel's format is mostly straight-forward.
2. I left one instance of `strftime` around, in a strange function `split_date` in `utils.py`.  
3. I didn't check any test cases…

I can fix these, but I need your explanation and opinion.

1) I can either update all translations, but I don't think that the format still needs to be translatable with babel.  Babel provides generic formats for short and long dates, which represent the corresponding locale's standard way of formatting dates.  They differ a bit from what Tinker currently uses, especially with regards to the short format, but I don't think it is worth the hassle of keeping these translations around for this tiny bit of control.

If the date was given with generic formatters, we could just add a Jinja filter for `format_date`, and do all the formatting in the templates.

2) As said, the whole purpose of this function is strange to me.  It seems to be used in `Post` to parse dates given on the command line when creating posts, but I don't get the whole date handling in `Post`.  Imho the whole API is convoluted.

Why do you split the date into three parts in the `Post` class?  Why don't you just use `datetime.date`?  Why don't use parse the date given on the command line with a custom `argparse` `type`?

But anyway, this function uses a mostly language-agnostic date format (at least with regards to western languages), so it should be safe.  It'll break, though, should a user ever get the idea of giving a Japanese date on the command line…

3) I can try to add test cases, or run them, but since you said you'll test on Windows anyway, I didn't do so yet…

If we just update translations, nothing will change.   If we remove the translations and just use the generic Babel modifiers, the dates will look a little different in the generated HTML.  That's it.

I don't think that any user will be surprised by this. Quite likely many users will even not even realize that the dates have changed.  I mean, who looks at the dates anyway?  They a just a small, and largely unimportant piece of metadata.

> How difficult it is to update translations? Can this be done quickly/automatically? I'm not very familiar with the localization APIs :)

How am I supposed to know answers to these questions?  Aren't you supposed to know how you handle translations in your own project?  I just saw that Tinkerer has translations, but I have no clue how you generate or update them.

By the way, if Babel is a dependency of Tinkerer now anyway, you can build on Babel to handle all localization.  That should work more reliably across Python 2 and 3, and make the UIStr class mostly superfluous.

> For 2, it is a funky way of extracting date from command line argument. I will open an issue to update that. Shouldn't be related to the change you are trying to make.

I'll leave it alone then.

Oh, well, up to this moment I didn't even realize that you have Travis builds :)  Besides, the Travis project is a little hard to get to, because the status image in the README doesn't link to it… at least for me clicking on this image is the standard way to get to Travis, and yours is the first project I see where this does not work.

I have found a bunch of issues in my first approach, which broke the tests.  I have fixed and force-pushed, and the [tests pass now](https://travis-ci.org/vladris/tinkerer/builds/12792814).

These fixes bring me to a new point 4):  The default language.  What language does Tinkerer use, if `language` is not set in `conf.py`?  English?  The system locale?

Currently, I presume the latter and fall back to the “default” (i.e. system) locale, if `app.config.language` is `None`.

### Why I do it?

You really talk your won't to implement this feature, but I think it because your are too busy, I understand, so I try to do something by myself and not just complain, avoid bother you more.

And then, give you a notice.

### Why it so importent?

For the other things, you say ""using `_static` folder for images"". But in some blog, each post has two or three pictures and those pictures are NOT BE USED BY OTHER POST. This is not a rare using case.

If I put all images in the `_static` folder, when blog have 300+ post (not a rare using case too), manage those pictures are impossible, and no reasonable.

### Technique problem

I'm try to implement this feature through `docutils api` but not just `regex`, so It's easy to maintain. and this Auto-Image-Move-Feature are NOT effect the out-of-the-same-folder images. It can avoid almost all side-effect.

The only weakness is: the `docutils directive` and `sphinx directive` there _look like_ not compatible. So I need to reload the `docutils.parsers.rst.directives` module for unregister the `sphinx directive` (like `author` directive) before the `move()` be called.

I'm also try to read the Travis error info, but still not sure what's going on. I am not really understand the unittest system.

The autoscaler wasn't authorized to query k8s api since it wasn't authenticated.
I have tested and pushed a fix on master so you can try it out as well.
The README was updated with instructions, but here is a summary of what you need to do:
Clone this repo, and fill `./helm-chart/values.yaml`.
You'll need to provide a `subscriptionId` as well now.
For clusters generated with acs-engine >= 0.12.0 you will also need to provide `etcdclientprivatekey` and `etcdserverprivatekey` and set `rbac.install` to true.

The chart will create a new service account for the autoscaler as well as all the necessary RBAC roles and bindings.

It's hard to say, I would need more logs to be able to tell, but basically a node in `undeschedulable` state means it has already been cordoned and drained.
The autoscaler will look at the number of spare agents, and it should never  cordon and drain a node if the number of available node is <= 2.
However once a node is cordoned and drained, the AS will delete it no matter the number of nodes available, which is what is happening here.
So the question is how did this node ended up cordoned in the first place?
Is it possible that you did a manual `kubectl cordon` on the node?",NA,https://api.github.com/repos/wbuchwalter/Kubernetes-acs-engine-autoscaler/issues/73/comments,https://github.com/wbuchwalter/Kubernetes-acs-engine-autoscaler/issues/73#issuecomment-356339607,https://api.github.com/repos/wbuchwalter/Kubernetes-acs-engine-autoscaler/issues/73

This means that while there currently are only 2 nodes in the pool, the autoscaler already created a deployment with 3 nodes in the `devops` pool. So most likely the deployment is still going on so the autoscaler does not redeploy a second time. 

Deploying a new node should take somewhere between 4 to 12 minutes depending on the VM type.

`--spare-agents` instructs the AS to not scale-in under the specified number.
`--over-provision` instructs the AS to scale out an additional number of nodes when scaling is necessary (for example if you know that when your loads starts picking up, it grows very fast).

For example, I know of some other people using this autoscaler that are setting `--spare-agent` to `20`, But don't want the AS to scale to 20 when the number of VMs is under this number. Say an admin deleted most of the VMs because he knows there won't be any load during the week-end, but load might be highly unpredictable during the week and thus doesn't want the AS to make any decision by itself under 20 nodes.

I guess a good solution would be to add another parameter such as `--force-spare` to instruct the AS to make sure the cluster is always at least `--spare-agent`'s size.

For now a very dirty solution for you is to manually create as many pending pods as needed to force the AS to scale up to `--spare-agents`.

In the current state of things, you would still need to do something like this:

which is a bit cumbersome for a simple command. The best way to do it would be to add a hook in the autoscaler so that it can receive commands at run time (a little bit like helm/tiller). I need to check the complexity of such a solution.

Also if you have a running instance of the autoscaler in your cluster, the node you manually scale up would still be killed after the period specified by `--idle-threshold`. Would that be fine for your use case?

I probably need to clean the TODOs. 
There was a time when I planned on supporting both ACS and acs-engine clusters. The comment about the issue with 0 agents is for ACS.

So if you set `--spare-agents 0`, your pool should be able to scale down to 0 agents (provided there is no system pods on this specific pool), and up again afterwards when you schedule some stuff.

I am having difficulty with the --spare-agents feature and I'm not sure if it's a bug.
If I set --spare-agents 1, will the autoscaler launch nodes to ensure 1 spare agent? Or does that flag only <i>limit the termination</i> of idle nodes?

Here is my situation:
In my cluster I have 2 pools:
agentpool0 -- GPU pool
agentpool1 -- CPU only pool

I would like to scale the CPU and GPU nodes using different parameters (higher --spare-agents for CPU-only nodes), so I have run a CPU-only autoscaler like this:
```bash
python main.py --ignore-pools 'agentpool0' --resource-group '<myclusterresourcegroup>' --spare-agents '1' -vvv
```
There are currently 0 CPU nodes in pool 1. Although there are no pending pods, I expect the autoscaler to launch a new CPU node to maintain the --spare-agents 1. Instead it takes no action. Here is the log output:

So if you have `--spare-agents 1` and you currently have 4 agents in your pool, the AS will kill 3 agents at most.  
But the autoscaler will not launch new nodes to meet the `--spare-agents` count. If there is 0 agent in the pool that means the user killed the VM manunally (since the autoscaler couldn't have done it itself if you have `--spare-agents 1`), and so the autoscaler will not bypass the user choice on this by recreating the node.

If you schedule enough CPU loads on your cluster, first your existing GPU VMs will be filled, but then you will have some pending pods that won't fit on the GPU nodes. At this point the AS will trigger a scale up and recreate some CPU nodes.   
At this point if you kill all your pods, the AS will kill all existing CPU nodes but one.

This is due to a limitation in ARM.  
In order to scale up, the autoscaler has to remove the NSG from the template before redeploying to avoid services interruption in the kubernetes cluster (see https://github.com/Azure/acs-engine/issues/979for more infos).  

But when you deploy a k8s cluster with a custom VNET, the NIC of each VM directly references the NSG, and so this NSG needs to be present in the template, which is not possible as explained above.

I will check if I can find a way to circumvent this, suggestions are welcome :)

I got this working with the following steps:

1.	Created a resource group
2.	Created a VNET in the resource group
3.	Created a NSG in the resource group with the inbound allow rules for 443 and 22
4.	Generated the template using acs-engine
5.	Deleted the NSG resource from the template.
6.	Modified the NSG variables to reflect the one created from the Portal.
7.	Modified the NSG ID to reflect the one created from the portal.
8.	Deployed the template successfully.
9.	Deployed the autoscaler
10.	Deployed a RC and modified to increase the pods.
11.	Correspondingly the autoscaler scales out the agent nodes.
12.	Now the autoscaler is successfully scaling in/out the agent nodes without any error.

The idea is to remove the NSG from the template and create it separately and then associate with the agent and master nodes.",NA,https://api.github.com/repos/wbuchwalter/Kubernetes-acs-engine-autoscaler/issues/34/comments,https://github.com/wbuchwalter/Kubernetes-acs-engine-autoscaler/issues/34#issuecomment-346667623,https://api.github.com/repos/wbuchwalter/Kubernetes-acs-engine-autoscaler/issues/34

1. Created a resource group

Our use case is we run JupyterHub (https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub) for a large dynamic classroom, where our node needs vary from 1 - ~60-70 over the course of every week. Each student gets a pod, and we can't kill or reschedule it - it loses their in-memory state, which is important. For our autoscaler, we'd ideally:

To scale down:
1. delete empty nodes if any
2. cordon off nodes that have low utilization

To scale up:
1. Uncordon any nodes first (only if they were cordoned off by the autoscaler tho!)
2. Add new nodes.

The reason cordoning is important is because k8s by default spreads out pods across many nodes, and we often get to a situation where nodes have only one pod running on them - so we can't kill them. Before that pod dies (when the student logs out), another pod is scheduled there - continuing this pattern. So if we could cordon off nodes first, that'll improve our effectiveness a lot.

We implemented all of this in a custom autoscaler ourselves for last semester on GKE - https://github.com/data-8/autoscaler. There's some azure support there, but I don't think that works with acs-engine! I hope we can switch to using this one instead of our hand-rolled one tho :)

I also pushed the docker image corresponding to this branch as `wbuchwalter/kubernetes-acs-engine-autoscaler:feature-cordon` could you give this a try and let me know if that works as expected for your use case?
It should work as describe by your workflow above.
 You can control the utilization threshold with `--util-threshold n` where `n` is the value in percent of the CPU usage under which you want to tag a node as under utilized.

I have moved to [fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin).  It runs TypeScript typechecking and optionally tslint in a secondary node process that does not affect the Webpack build process.

[ts-loader](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-loader#faster-builds) now recommends this setup.  Setting the `happyPack` flag (derived from also using the [happypack loader](https://github.com/amireh/happypack)) it performs transpilation only (`transpileOnly`), while fork-ts-checker is performing the typechecking & linting.  That and the addition of [cache-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/cache-loader) & [thread-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/thread-loader) (which is inter-changable with happypack), it has now immensely improved performance over the awesome-typescript-loader.

That would mean that, in a way, tslint would run together within the compiler instead of using a separate loader and passing all result all over again from one loader to another.

Of course, by default, TS plugins get ignored during compilation. However, there is a workaround to make them work as part of the compiler. Advantage of this? Messages of tslint are part of the compiler diagnostics and tslint is run at the same time while the file is being transpiled (and type checking as well).

The problem with `ts-loader` is that Type Checking doesn't work with HappyPack or `thread-loader` which instead increases build time.
So I started to work on an experiment and finally decided to write a TS loader, with those ideas in mind, that works with HappyPack/`thread-loader` (including Type Checking) and runs tslint within the Compiler as a TS Language Service Plugin...

Although, I assume this is only a problem because you are using Dev Server or some variant of watch mode.  That PR may be ok for simple builds.

Alternatively, adding a [compiler plugin](https://webpack.js.org/api/plugins/compiler/) for this loader which supports events for `run` & `watch-run`, we could use those event hooks to recreate the Program object for a ""run"".

But I guess your proposal would work.

Also, during my own tslint performance testing I found out that creating the ``Program`` object isn't that expensive (unless it is re-created for every single file of course, which only makes sense in a watch mode).

Here is a comparison between running tslint on our codebase directly and using tslint-loader:

webpack without tslint-loader (includes assets, less, etc): ~30 secs
webpack with tslint-loader and type checking enabled: ~80 secs
tslint CLI, with typechecking: ~6 secs

Using tslint-loader with type checking takes an additional 50 seconds for our webpack build to complete. But using tslint directly from the CLI instead takes only around 6 seconds.

So the performance issues people are reporting here aren't really tslint or typechecking related. As I see it the problem must be either in tslint-loader or webpack itself.

having the same issue.
I moved the tslint configuration line into the rule:
```
    {
        enforce: 'pre',
        test: /.ts$/,
        loader: 'tslint-loader',
        exclude: /node_modules/,
        options: {
          configuration:  require( '../tslint.json' )
        }
      },
```
Still same issue.
I dumped the TSLint json and it looks good. There are no errors in my lint configuration.

The rule configuration going into the `convertRuleOptions` function in `tslint/lib/configuration: line 355` is an object literal, and you are trying to do a forEach on an object literal which is not a native function of Object.
So either use the Object.keys() and iterate over the keys or add Lodash forEach to iterate over this object.

Maybe the tslint-loader should offer the rules object in a an array format so that tslint can use the foreach, instead of my suggestion (which might break in other solution if there is an array passed in instead of an object).

When I look at your docs, the configuration expects  a `rules` object so I am not sure how this tslint  
would have worked before. Maybe it used to expect an array?

```
function convertRuleOptions(ruleConfiguration) {

    var output = [];
    var ruleKeys = Object.keys(ruleConfiguration);
    ruleKeys.forEach( function( key ) {
        var partialOptions = ruleConfiguration[ key ];
        var ruleName = key;
        var options = {
            disabledIntervals: [],
            ruleArguments: partialOptions.ruleArguments || [],
            ruleName: ruleName,
            ruleSeverity: partialOptions.ruleSeverity || ""error"",
        };
        output.push(options);
    });
    // console.log(output);
    // ruleConfiguration.forEach(function (partialOptions, ruleName) {
    //     var options = {
    //         disabledIntervals: [],
    //         ruleArguments: partialOptions.ruleArguments || [],
    //         ruleName: ruleName,
    //         ruleSeverity: partialOptions.ruleSeverity || ""error"",
    //     };
    //     output.push(options);
    // });
    return output;
}
```
But I am going to suggest another fix where tslint-loader converts to rules object to an array of rules objects, so that tslint will not through the error of not having a forEach on the prototype.

UPDATE: I came to the conclusion that it is not tslint-loaders issue here, because the function `convertRuleOptions` in tslint's configuration.js file is doing a foreach on a dictionary. Even if I convert it to array, it's code will fail because ruleName will be a number (the array index).

I'm totally open to give contributor access to people willing to participate (send me an email to wbuchwalter at gmail.com if you are interested).
I'm also open to transfer the repo, but not too anyone obviously. An organization/person that has a good track record on GitHub would be ideal.

Thanks

Thanks for the PR.
Ideally we should modify tslint-loader options structure to follow tslint structure, to have this:

```
module.exports = {

    tslint: {
        configuration: {
            rules: {
                quotemark: [true, ""double""]
            },
        },
        formatter: ""json"",
        formattersDirectory: ""customFormatters/"",
        emitErrors: false,
        failOnHint: true,
    }
}
```

That would allow us to do

```
merge(options, this.options.tslint);
```

and remove the need for 

```
if (this.options.tslint.formatter) {
    [...]
}

if (this.options.tslint.formattersDirectory) {
   [...]
}
```

If you don't want/have time to do this, let me know and i'll implement that soon.

Thanks!

So as I know, it is possible, but it is way too much work to do it.

Once an Assembly got loaded into an AppDomain, it cannot be unload, but it can be overloaded and there are some ways to change code business logics on the fly.
But to do that, the program you need to either hijack the process or modify some binaries, which is not much better than the current approach.

> why aren't they included in the github source code?

I believe it's because dlls is not ""source code"" and it's easier to deliver/update through nuget.

> where do they come from?

this dlls from ""~\Blizzard\Hearthstone\Hearthstone_Data\Managed"", you can find them and use instead of nuget, but 'cause they (blizzard) start encrypt Assembly-CSharp.dll (#31), you'll need this code to decrypt it:

https://gist.github.com/yangyuan/14444ccbc08517f64b31cf24165fccf2

> My current understanding is that they're decompiled game files -> extended with hearthrock's logic -> recompiled. Is this correct?

I think you are right, but to be clear:

1. decrypt Assembly-CSharp.dll
2. patch Assembly-CSharp.dll with this code (it'll be add Hearthrock.dll to references, and call it before/after some methods):
https://github.com/yangyuan/hearthrock/blob/master/src/Hearthrock.Client/Hacking/MonoCecilExtensions.cs
4. replace original Assembly-CSharp.dll with patched version

well, bot engine can do anything that Assembly-CSharp.dll contain, if you need something new, for example, ""bool IsMinionFrozen"", you can easily add this here: https://github.com/yangyuan/hearthrock/blob/master/src/Hearthrock/Pegasus/Internal/RockPegasusSnapshotHelper.cs and re-patch Assembly-CSharp.dll

I think, best way to learn (if you don't work for blizzard, I believe that they have some manual) it's use engine's source code: https://github.com/yangyuan/hearthrock/tree/master/src/Hearthrock

The method work fine for me. Replace the assembly-csharp.dll, then run Hearthrock.Client.exe, it will work.
But when try to build the project using the new assembly-csharp.dll, it failed.

you have to choose some programming language for start (I prefer C# or python)

    print(scene)

        return []

1. patch the game with rock.client and select ""remote bot"" - write in tetbox your server url (""like http://localhost:6969/ "")

After the bot give `[cleric, minion]`, the engine should click/drop `cleric`, then `minion`. And during this time, the engine will not check `PlayOption`.

> 4. Not click who it was told to target with it

I think the problem is the 4th step. I believe that the bot tried to do that but failed.

By default, the delay between actions is 1 sec. And if the state is `RockPegasusGameState.Blocking`, also delay 1 sec. There might be some special cases when the state should be RockPegasusGameState.Blocking but it isn't. Thus the game tried to click the target in a bad time and failed.

One way to debug is to increase the delays to see if the problem is gone. Another way is to trace RockEngineAction.Apply() to make sure the engine does try to click the target.
I don't have much time this week so someone is interested you can try first.

I know the method UniversalInputManager.GetMousePosition before, but hooking that will disable all other game mouse features and mess up PlayZoneSlotMousedOver so I didn't hook that.
But since we have already hooked PlayZoneSlotMousedOver, maybe its okay to do hook GetMousePosition.

I built a little tool that encrypts the modified `Assembly-CSharp.dll` again but apparently the ""whats new tutorial"" issue isn't related to encryption, since it appears even with the encrypted assembly.

I've attached the encrypted assembly so you can test it yourself.

So you are using the previews code I shared.
That code is hard-coded for original DLL. @michaelpittino is right, after ""hook"", the PE header of DLL has been modified by mono.cecil thus original decrypt code cannot work on that.

I don't think that could be the ROC.
First, the .NET implementation does not care PE headers that much.

- Text section is actually some binary tables. If decryption is wrong, then assembly should not even runnable.

The suboptions are available. But sometimes bot might be stuck in a state that:

>  The parent card has been chosen and the sub cards cannot be chosen. And the bot is trying to choose other cards instead of sub cards.

This might happen due to some client/human issues. Right now I don't think its an issue.

**About Discover/Adapt Cards**

IDK why, but in the code Blizzard choose to make Discover/Adapt not an ""Option"", instead, they make it a separated field ""Choices"" in GameState class. I didn't notice that.

Maybe because the behavior of Discover/Adapt and Mulligan are too similar so they decided to share the design.

I've changed the code and doing some final test, probably will push the commit soon.

But, I'm assuming all the Discover/Adapt cards will only ask for choosing one option, is there any exceptions?

**ChoiceCardMgr**

I don't think this is a good direction. ChoiceCardMgr is a UI class. I believe Blizzard must be following the basic design practices and keep ""State"" and ""UI"" separated.

`fvim` is compatible with `nvr`, just `pip install neovim-remote` and you'll be able to use the command within the neovim terminal.

1. It looks for the user's default shell
2. It uses the default shell as a login shell, run `/usr/bin/env` to extract the environment variables
3. It creates an isolated environment from the extracted info, and launches FVim.

You can check for logs in the Console app. Search for events that start with ""FVim:"", it will print the captured PATH var so you can inspect what's wrong with it. Also check `SHELL` variable to see if it's your default shell -- and other variables to see if your default rc file is sourced.

Another gotcha is that the launcher may not be able to extract the environment from an interactive session. So if you have this at the beginning of your rc:

```bash

Either it doesn't like drawing that many items on the drop down list or ? I don't know. No problems with default in a terminal.~ Actually it just reduces the lag, doesn't actually fix it. Still lose input sometimes.

But here is another issue, the description window falls behind the dropdown so it is difficult to read.
Expected: Properly size the window and place it left or right of the dropdown. This is what I'm use to when using nvim with terminal.

For me, flickering happens not only during scrolling, but sometimes even when I move the cursor, f.ex. by holding HJKL keys (I know, I know :P), or virtually any other operation changing screen contents (switching between normal and insert mode, switching windows, etc.).

Unfortunately, I don't have skills to debug this, but I have a few observations which might help to proceed here:
* The issue remains reproducible when fvim is started with `-u NORC`, so it's not likely to be related to any plugin.
* When the window flickers, it does so by briefly becoming transparent – that is, it doesn't turn fully white. Instead, one can see the contents of other windows underneath for a brief moment.

`ssh remote -C 'nvim --version'` does not find nvim.

But, a regular ssh session to an interactive shell works.

Interesting to note: nvim is in a slightly nonstandard path on the remote.
On the remote nvim lives in `~/.local/bin/nvim`

It looks like ssh is not setting up my PATH or loading my .bashrc at all when not running in interactive mode 😢 

I can confirm this by doing ssh remote -c ""echo $PATH""

Other than the unclear error message, this seems like this is a ssh / bash config issue on my part and not an fvim issue 😄

Edit:
looking at the man page for bash:
```
When bash is started non-interactively, to run a shell script, for example, it looks for the variable BASH_ENV in the environment, expands its value if it appears there, and uses the expanded value as the name of a file to read and execute. Bash behaves as if the following command were executed:

    if [ -n ""$BASH_ENV"" ]; then . ""$BASH_ENV""; fi 
but the value of the PATH variable is not used to search for the file name. 
```
I'm not sure if there is a way to make bash find the correct PATH in non-interactive mode...

Yeah, sorry, I forgot to mention that all the text _in the buffer_ have a disrupted background, but not any of the text in the status line.

> What's the font being used?

Whatever font is default with neovim. I renamed init.vim and ginit.vim to init.vim.old and ginit.vim.old so that it would use all the defaults so that I could be sure it wasn't something in one of those file that was causing the font rendering problems. I belive it's DejaVu Sans Mono, but I'd have to check to be sure.

Yes.

I noticed that the latest update of FVim was only 16 days ago, and that this is the only issue created since then. In fact, the next latest issue was opened on Feb 15.

The problem with the PR is that although it correctly passes the `$PATH` to FVim and it starts successfully, FVim only uses it to launch `nvim` and then it doesn't keeps it around (i.e. although `:!/usr/libexec/path_helper -s` correctly reports my `$PATH`, `:echo $PATH` doesn't). The problem is the user loses access to any external binary (in my case I install things like FZF with the Nix package manager) and other useful environment variables. Previously it worked for some users because it sourced `/etc/profile` and `~/.bash_profile`, but failed for users of other shells.

So I think what the PR lacks is a way to get (probably in [`neovim.fs`](https://github.com/yatli/fvim/blob/83a779851ada77ea2857895a02843735793858c4/neovim.fs)):

1. The value of `$SHELL`
2. Use it to execute `env` (this will provide all the user environment variables, not only `$PATH`)
3. Parse the output and feed it to Neovim at launch

I got the idea [from goneovim](https://github.com/akiyosi/goneovim/blob/master/editor/editor.go#L374). I switch between both GUIs randomly and in my experience works quite well.

That reminds me of a similar problem on Linux -- when I use `fvim --ssh` into a Linux server, I cannot use the local node.js installation or the Anaconda environment. It's probably related because it's also the lack of proper env settings.

So if you have the time, please go ahead to implement it.

Perhaps this could be added to the README or wiki?


I inserted the following line
```fsharp
(0x23fa, 0x1f5d9)
```
(which, according to http://unicode.scarfboy.com/?s=%F0%9F%97%99%E2%9E%A4%E2%97%8F%E2%8F%BA, encompasses the range for the characters I mentioned in the statusline and sign column)

in the `NerdFont` array and recompiled (from the release commit used by the AUR FVim). I did not observe any difference in character rendering; the same characters rendered incorrectly. I tried building from `master` but haven't been able to get it to compile on my machine (I get an error about not being able to target .NET Core 3.0).

If that's not what you meant by inserting the missing range, please let me know and I can try again.

I unfortunately don't know of anywhere that documents those codepoints; as far as I was aware, they were ordinary Unicode symbols. I found them in a variety of docs and vim configs over a while; I'm afraid I don't know specifically where each came from originally.

Subject: [yatli/fvim] Win 10 wsl1 mouse doesn't work (#101)


Mouse doesn't seem to work on Win 10 -> wsl1 (neovim 0.3.8)
Not sure if I need to do anything special besides 'set mouse'.

So I run same config but do it in Win10 only, but neovim 0.4.3 and mouse works.

1. The blur spreads past the edge of the window

2. With this background I almost feel like the standard windows title bar detracts from the overall look. Maybe some way to disable the title bar so that the window is raw, or implement your own somehow would make it look more consistent and push the appearance over the top.

3. This could be a huge mind-share boost for you. An awesome looking neovim client which is as close to gvim as possible while having some extra useful features is sorely lacking. At least on windows your options are confined to this and sorta nvim-qt which looks pretty bad in my opinion. The ligature and high dpi support in fvim is pretty awesome, and this would I think make it one of the prettiest neovim clients.

My only complaint is that since the buttons are somewhat jank when it comes to starting the app after it was maximized. A couple of notes:

1. Since the style is set in vimscript, the window moves somewhat on startup from the restored position. Not sure there is anything to be done here other than some hacks to record whether the custom style was set and then restore that style on reboot
2. If the app was maximized, closed, and restarted, the buttons don't work properly
3. Minimize button doesn't work all the time when the window is maximized

These are super minor though and I think it goes a long way toward making the view look consistent. Honestly I might even be interested in a no chrome experience if you exposed the functions for maximize minimize and drag to vimscript.

Btw I changed font 'SF Mono' -> 'Cascadia Code', this one doesn't re-render different like in gif above. Default line height and 'g' no issues with vertical clipping. Only issue still is the squiggle underline looks poor / clips.

In SF Mono I can fix issues if I set line height big enough, in Cascadia Code, line height makes no difference on squiggle underline.

Btw if you want to reproduce: 
- `set guifont=SF\ Mono:h16`
- start with default line height
- italic 'g' (i use dracula theme)

What I want to do is described in the comments in `RenderText`:
```F#
    //  h = [padding space 1] + above baseline | below baseline + [padding space 2]
```
I use `FontMetrics.Top` for ""above baseline"" and `Bottom` for ""below baseline"".
You can think of paddings as 1/2 leading space.
So, flipping items around we can calculate the padding, and the baseline.

But actually the equation simply does not hold in the clipping case -- here's some running data logged:

```
ui: h: 17.142857 bottom: 6.841290, top: -16.205219, total padding: -5.903652

PositionChanged event immediately triggers after MainWindow.xaml.fs initialization (this is where +13, +58 come from). Anyway I am not sure why, does not seem right for event to trigger so fast. Window initializes with correct values, but it happens so fast that by the time the window is rendered, you see the wrong values on screen.


So looks like this:
1. Load cfg , initialize Window -- OK
2. OnDataContextChanged trigger (from initialize?) -- OK
3. PositionChanged triggered (from ondata?) -- BAD
4. Window init finished, renders to screen and I see the bad position
then.....
few seconds later see another PositionChanged trigger (same bad position) but why? I still have not touched the window.

Subject: Re: [yatli/fvim] Weird overlapping with fira code font (#61)


Ok I think I see the problem... when a font is not found fvim defaults to some behavior like this instead of doing nothing & reporting font is not found.

if you do :set guifont=FiraCode:h11 you will get this, because the font name is incorrect.

instead try :set guifont=Fira\ Code:h11 and it should be ok.

1. `--self-contained` is paired with `true`, which is missing in `pack.sh` (just checked the doc, this is supported)
2. `-o` used to designate the output directory
3. `pack.sh` copies the `publish` directory, and on the other hand, `PKGBUILD` copies the -o designated directory

I just tried this on Windows:

```ps1
dotnet publish -f netcoreapp3.0 -r win10-x64 -c Release -o test_pub --self-contained
cd test_pub
$a = Get-ChildItem -Recurse .
$b = Get-ChildItem -Recurse ..\bin\Release\netcoreapp3.0\win10-x64
Compare-Object $a $b

I've installed and tested the newest build via `debtap`. Shift is working for me now, but I am still having an issue with the `capslock` key. In both normal and insert mode, it's seeming to input the characters individually? For example, given the following text and assuming `normal` mode with a cursor at the first character in the line:
```
Some Example Text
```
Hitting the capslock key would result in the following (with the cursor on the final character ""k""):
```
slock
```
So it seems as if it's interpreting the following keys were entered in order
`c`,`a`,`p`,`s`,`l`,`o`,`c`,`k`

First of all, thanks for creating a neovim ui on the .Net platform. 😃 

I'm experiencing the same issue.
I've had a little dive into your code and traces while I've tried fvim key commands and I may be able to at least give some pointers.

Please take the following with a grain of salt since I'm neither an F# expert nor an Avalonia expert.

I'm using a German keyboard layout where "":"" is on ""SHIFT-."" (so, SHIFT-period). The triggered input is "">"".
When typing this key combination, ""SHIFT-period"" is exactly what is logged:

```
model: grid #1: OnInput: Key (Shift,OemPeriod)
```

So keystroke detection seems to work, right?
I've found that trace here: https://github.com/yatli/fvim/blob/master/model.fs#L398 so I attached a breakpoint.

The pressed key combination is then transformed here: https://github.com/yatli/fvim/blob/master/model.fs#L410

which seems to trigger the match here: https://github.com/yatli/fvim/blob/master/model.fs#L205
(sorry for all the links 😉 )

""SHIFT-period"" is then explicitly transformed to nvim_input "">"" here: https://github.com/yatli/fvim/blob/master/model.fs#L299

Of course, changing

```
        |  Key(HasFlag(KeyModifiers.Shift), Key.OemPeriod)            -> Normal "">""
```
to
```
        |  Key(HasFlag(KeyModifiers.Shift), Key.OemPeriod)            -> Normal "":""
```

""solves"" the issue (for users of a German keyboard layout, therefore the air quotes 😃).

Edit: the full trace seems to be even more interesting:

```
model: grid #1: OnInput: Key (Shift,OemPeriod)
neovim.process: call: 40 -> [0,40,""nvim_input"",["">""]]
model: grid #1: OnInput: Key (Shift,OemPeriod)
model: grid #1: OnInput: TextInput "":""
model: rejected: TextInput "":""
model: grid #1: OnInput: TextInput "":""
model: rejected: TextInput "":""

However, I think you should rather pursue a general way of making sure that FVim is interacting with the ""system keyboard"", i.e. the layout set by the operating system, rather than either assuming a layout or interacting with some kind of ""hardware layout"" or some such. Although I have no knowledge of F# whatsoever, surely there must be a way to catch keys ""as interpreted by the operating system""?

The issue isn't how a non-US keyboard layout works in ViM, but rather that keys are mapped differently in different languages. What we want is for FVim to get, that when I press, say, ""shift + the second hardware key from the right-hand shift-key"", it is mapped to "":"". Whereas you would, on a US-keyboard, press a different hardware key for the same result ("":""). 

It wouldn't help, I think, if we'd sit down and show you what it looks like, or how ViM behaves on non-US keyboards.

And yeah.. That's the part I can't get my thinking through. Say every key has a virtual code, no matter what layout it is. Let's call it VK. Generally, I'd like the OS to provide the translation service to me, so I ask for `F = get_translation(layout)`, and, VK in, F(VK) out. Simple, right.

But getting modifiers involved fries my brain. Say there is a key that `F(VK)=TR` where TR is translated text, and CTRL is pressed.

Just to reiterate the point in my post above, using your recent example. It shouldn't matter what hardware keys are actually pressed, what matters is what the system interprets it as. You shouldn't, I'd think, have to bother yourself with how the user has his or her keys mapped, but what input the system tells you it has received. You shouldn't have to tackle all the different hardware keyboards and keyboard layouts there is. That is already tasked to the OS. 

Never mind if the user _presses_ hardware keys `<C-å>` or `<C-[>`, what matters is what it _means._ That interpretation is tasked to the OS, not to the individual applications (unless said applications are made with programming languages close to the hardware, not interfacing with the operating system). Hardware makes signal ""keys `<Ctrl-Alt-8>` pressed"" (yes, those are the keys I'd press on macOS, if I'd want `<CTRL+[>`); the OS interprets it: ""ah, I see you want to express `<C-[>`"" and forwards _not_ the hardware signal (`<C-A-8>`) _but the meaning_ (`<C-[>`); the listening application reads signal ""input `<C-[>` received"" and does what the user expects when said input is received.

I would think you'd be able to interface with the OS and from there receive the signal `<C-[>`. But perhaps Avalonia isn't there yet? Neither in the core or additional libraries? I don't know.

But in reality (read: Avalonia) that's not likely to happen.

In Avalonia there are two kinds of keyboard events -- text input events and key press events.
Normally a programmer will just work with ""text input"", which is already layout-translated (at least for Windows).
But here we're trying to forward everything that happens to the keyboard to Neovim -- and text input is not enough -- it doesn't even have the concept of modifier keys.
So what we get here is tuples of `Modifiers * KeyCode` where `KeyCode` is a layout-agnostic number (VK in my example) -- or rather say, ""what key it should be if it's en-US"".

Because Avalonia doesn't know about layouts, there's no way that the message will be translated, with keycode, or even the modifiers, being translated.
What's worse, the key codes we're looking at isn't OS-specific keys but normalized by Avalonia, so we cannot directly go back to an OS service.

Regarding the display name, SharePoint gives a chance to claims providers (AzureCP) to set the display name **only** if the user is added for the very first time to the site collection. And no, it doesn't work to delete and re-add the user.

If the user is actually added for the 1st time (you may test in a new temp site collection), AzureCP will set the display name of the user (no matter if he is guest or not) based on this highlighted setting (in central admin > Security > AzureCP claim types configuration):

A possible solution is to create new custom claims providers that use AzureCP as a base class. It approach works fine but:

This is what the user appears as, after adding them. Notice that the SP Name value is the OnPremisesUserPrincipleName, instead of the DisplayName:

I will say that I did have to make one change to the Trusted Identity Provider today. I'm not sure if that is related. I haven't made ANY changes to the AzureCP configuration, though. The change I made to the TIP was, I changed the ClaimsProviderName from AzureCP, back to AzureAD temporarily. I had to do this so that I could run Convert-SPWebApplication against an additional WebApp. After the conversion of the claims for that WebApp was completed though, I immediately changed the ClaimsProviderName on the TIP back to AzureCP.

When we add a Tenant, we have a choice to select 'Filter our Guest Users' on the configuration screen

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19915644/100899547-f7f61780-348f-11eb-9896-2440a3a26ab1.png)

So, when I configure like above and perform a search, the below is what I get.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19915644/100899049-69819600-348f-11eb-86ae-75ab1ede3966.png)

But, when I configure the connection without selecting the 'Filter out Guest users on this tenant' and use PowerShell to update the filter attribute it works.

```
Identifier                  : xxxx
Name                        : xxxx
ApplicationId               : xxxx
ApplicationSecret           : xxxx
ExcludeMembers              : False
ExcludeGuests               : True
ClientCertificatePrivateKey : 
AuthenticationMode          : ClientSecret
GraphService                : 
UserFilter                  : 
GroupFilter                 : 
UserSelect                  : 
GroupSelect                 : 
UpgradedPersistedProperties : {}
```

So, if I do it through UI it does not work, but with PowerShell it does. Now, I do not know if the update made through PowerShell is really working, since I do not have any guest users in my tenant.

Interestingly, that does not reflect on the configuration page, even though it does show in my PowerShell result.

Based on RegEdit and MS Docs, my production farms appear to be running 4.7. I have a lower level 2016 environment also not working that is running 4.6.2.

My farms should be pretty much standard, so I guess the question now is whether I can install a .Net update to get the proper assemblies, or whether I should wait for a new installation to be released, or simply revert to V16?

I had uninstalled v17 from my test environment and reinstalled and configured V16 to document the process, just in case we went that direction with production.  So to do your test, I updated to V17 and verified I could not connect to AzureAD.  (I did not remove and recreate the Get-SPTrustedIdentityTokenIssuer at this time.)

I used the script at https://yvand.github.io/AzureCP/Install-AzureCP.html to install the new System.Net.Http.dll to the GAC, which looked successful with this response:

GAC    Version        Location
True   v4.0.30319     C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.Net\assembly\GAC_64\System.EnterpriseServices\v4.0_4.0.0.0__b03f5f7f11d50a3a\System.EnterpriseServices.dll

Assembly System.Net.Http, Version=4.2.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a sucessfully added to the GAC

However, when I run:

[System.Reflection.Assembly]::Load(""System.Net.Http, Version=4.2.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a"")

it still errors, and when I run this:

[System.Reflection.Assembly]::Load(""System.Net.Http, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a"")

It returns:

True   v4.0.30319     C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.Net\assembly\GAC_MSIL\System.Net.Http\v4.0_4.0.0.0__b03f5f7f11d50a3a\Syst...

When I drill down into C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\assembly\GAC_MSIL\System.Net.Http\v4.0_4.0.0.0__b03f5f7f11d50a3a, it contains the older DLL, so where did it install the new one?

I’ll keep looking, but I’m pretty confused.  Obviously, I’m not a .Net developer.

This is probably getting beyond me—I’m not a developer, I’m a system administrator.  I’m using the installable version of your tool because Microsoft recommended it (although made it clear they did not support it).  Version 16 clearly works on my SharePoint 2016 farms (without Visual Studio installed) and Version 17 doesn’t.  I am prepared to move forward with V16, as I have no other choice.  This is so consistent, there must be hundreds (if not thousands) of admins who have seen this issue.

That being said, thank you very much for developing this application to fill a void and diligently maintaining it.

Based on your previous comment https://github.com/Yvand/AzureCP/issues/104#issuecomment-729252011 you are already running with version 4.7.3620 (same as me)

I have a theory:
Both [Nito.AsyncEx](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Nito.AsyncEx/) (through a dependency on [System.Collections.Immutable](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Collections.Immutable/)) and [Microsoft.Graph.Core](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Graph.Core/1.22.0) (through a dependency on [System.Diagnostics.DiagnosticSource](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Diagnostics.DiagnosticSource/)) have a dependency on [System.Memory](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Memory/), but the subtlety is that I think one has it through .NET Standard 2.1 and the other through .NET Framework 4.6.1.
When restoring packages NuGet makes a choice, and it may be that (bad?) choice that is causing the issue.
I get this suspicion after reading [this article](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard), especially the little ""2"" note, as AzureCP currently targets .NET Framework 4.6.1...",NA,https://api.github.com/repos/Yvand/AzureCP/issues/104/comments,https://github.com/Yvand/AzureCP/issues/104#issuecomment-730450140,https://api.github.com/repos/Yvand/AzureCP/issues/104

It reduced the number of dependencies from 115 (!!) to 18, so I'm very seriously thinking about changing that for good.

The downside is that SharePoint 2013+ require only 4.5, so some would need to update specifically for using AzureCP, but [4.5](https://docs.microsoft.com/lifecycle/products/microsoft-net-framework-45) is no longer supported and 4.7.2 was released [in 2018](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/products/microsoft-net-framework-472), so it shouldn't be so problematic",NA,https://api.github.com/repos/Yvand/AzureCP/issues/104/comments,https://github.com/Yvand/AzureCP/issues/104#issuecomment-730480204,https://api.github.com/repos/Yvand/AzureCP/issues/104

This time we are unable to deploy the AzureCP itself.  when  i tried to deploy the WSP file as a farm solution, its taking more time than usual.  For more than 3 hours the status hasn’t changed from deploying. I even tried to remove the solution and added again, but still it results the same. Also I verified with other normal WSP files, they are all working fine and get deployed within minutes.

So request you to reply, what is the expected deployment time for AzureCP and does the above mentioned behavior is the expected one or not ?.

so after testing I find out that this is the issue as you said: ""FYI, AzureCP can only set profiles properties in the site collections, where user is added for the 1st time in the site collection""
how I can add them for the first time if they already were added before we deployed AzureCP. I mean I need to perform this on existing old site collection and I am open to delete all users and add them again (if its possible please help me to reference or help me find a solution)

This command results in the error below.

Both endpoints are set correctly:

Everything seems to be configured correctly but I still get the same error in the log and in the UI (Unable to get access token for tenant 'srcincgov1.onMicrosoft.com': One or more errors occurred.).

$tenant.GraphServiceEndpoint

 

https://login.microsoftonline.us

https://graph.microsoft.us

 

PS C:\Windows\system32>  

 

A lightbulb just went off and the good news is that People Picker is working again.

 

The Error that I keep getting is when I click the “Test Connection to Tenat” button – so maybe that method is not using the $tenant.LoginServiceEndpoint property?

Am I confused?

Based on what you said below, after setting the endpoints in PowerShell, the Test Connection to Tenant button should work.

Even so, I don’t see why the button couldn’t read the endpoint from the Tenant configuration and then try the connection?

 

I am just glad it’s working where it counts J

hi Fernando,
indeed, the “Test Connection to Tenant” button cannot work because you cannot override the default endpoint URLs in this page, you have to do it later in PowerShell.

I was so happy that we got AzureCP working with an Azure.us tenant but unfortunately it stopped working and I have not been able to diagnose the cause.

I have reconfigured AzureCP and re-added the tenant but the people picker just won’t return any results.

 

I added the endpoints with PowerShell

 

Add-Type -AssemblyName ""AzureCP, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=65dc6b5903b51636""

$config = [azurecp.AzureCPConfig]::GetConfiguration(""AzureCPConfig"")

$tenant = $config.GetAzureTenantByName(""tenantname.onmicrosoft.com"")

$tenant.LoginServiceEndpoint = ""https://login.microsoftonline.us""

$tenant.GraphServiceEndpoint = ""https://graph.microsoft.us""

$config.Update()

I’ve associated the identity provider with AzureCP

 

$ap=Get-SPTrustedIdentityTokenIssuer $Name

$ap.ClaimProviderName = ""AzureCP""

$ap.Update()

Added the tenant using the

AppRegistration ID and the Secret

 

I gave the App Directory.Read.All permissions

 

Nothing seems to be working.

 

Can you please tell me how to diagnose this?  Are there logs somewhere?

 

Thanks a lot,

Fernando

Even so, I don’t see why the button couldn’t read the endpoint from the Tenant configuration and then try the connection?

hi Fernando,
indeed, the “Test Connection to Tenant” button cannot work because you cannot override the default endpoint URLs in this page, you have to do it later in PowerShell.
I did add the endpoints here as the need to change them is a rare scenario (you are only the 2nd person to request it), and I want to keep this dialog as simple as possible. Does that make sense? Did you find any other issue?

I removed the previous version via powershell and was then able to install and deploy this successfully.

 

Everything in the configuration and adding the tenant seems to work fine including the “Test Connection to Tenant” but unfortunately people piker is not returning anything.

 

Do you have a powershell command to test the query people picker would make?

 

Thanks,

Fernando

Yvan,

 

Installing the wsp reports the following error:

 

Could not load file or assembly 'Microsoft.Graph, Version=3.8.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=31bf3856ad364e35' or one of its dependencies. The system cannot find the file specified.

 

 

Let me know what to do next.

Thanks,

Fernando

Below is the output of the dependency check. I am not sure why those assemblies are not available. The server is 100% up to date with patches. (Windows Server 2012R2)

 

Additionally, see the attached log for the errors when I try to use people picker.

I hope this helps.

 

I’ve sanitized the domain and user but otherwise the log is original

 

Thanks,

Fernando

I removed the tenant, added the tenant making sure I had the USGov Cloud and tested the people picker.  No results returned.

Another piece of information.  After a while, the configuration changes itself from the USGov cloud to the Azure Public setting.

 

Let me know if I can help some how…

Thanks for the below but I am not sure I would know what to do with that.

 

Did the logs I sent you provide any insight into the solution?

@Yvand nice to meet! First of all, thanks for your great work regarding this product! I'm the one who can answer your question, and offcourse i'm willing to share as much detail i can. If you have morge questions than answered here below, just ask. For now, i will limit myself to only the relevant parts (as far as there would be stuff left out).

@dvanboven put me on track wat was happening, the issues that came around, en my luck was my programming and Sharepoint background. Not of the level of expert, but enough to be able tot troubleshoot dll issues, GAC, x64 or x32 relevants, view log files and so on.

So to the point! First of all was during registering the dependecies. When running it, there was an error regarding a failure during running the script as mentioned on your website:

$assemblies = Get-ChildItem -Path ""C:\Options\AzureAD\AzureCP\*.dll""
[System.Reflection.Assembly]::Load(""System.EnterpriseServices, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a"")
$publish = New-Object System.EnterpriseServices.Internal.Publish
foreach ($assembly in $assemblies)
{
    $filePath = $assembly.FullName
    $assemblyFullName = [System.Reflection.AssemblyName]::GetAssemblyName($filePath).FullName

    try
    {
        $assemblyInGAC = [System.Reflection.Assembly]::Load($assemblyFullName)
        Write-Host ""Assembly $assemblyFullName is already present in the GAC""

        if ($assemblyInGAC.FullName -match ""AzureCP, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=65dc6b5903b51636"")
        {
            # AzureCP must always be overwritten because each version has the same full name
            $publish.GacRemove($assemblyInGAC)
            $publish.GacInstall($filePath)
            Write-Host ""Assembly $assemblyFullName sucessfully re-added to the GAC"" -ForegroundColor Green
        }
    }
    catch [System.IO.FileNotFoundException] 
    {
        # Assembly.Load throws a FileNotFoundException if assembly is not found in the GAC: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.io.filenotfoundexception?view=netframework-4.8
        Write-Host ""Adding assembly $assemblyFullName to the GAC""
        $publish.GacInstall($filePath)
        Write-Host ""Assembly $assemblyFullName sucessfully added to the GAC"" -ForegroundColor Green
    }
}

As this could be referencing to one of the other dll's not registering, or not being installed at all, we started diving in here. Because i wasn't quite sure if:
$assemblyInGAC = [System.Reflection.Assembly]::Load($assemblyFullName)
would throw a catch, we did the resgistration through a loop. Trying to register all files by hand.
It seems to work, but deregistering first and doing a re-register, was failing on Newtonsoft.Json.dll. I could imagine that parsing results with such an old version, could be causing troubles.

So when diving in to this, it seemed that even a gacutil /u /f newtonsoft.json (warning, i do this from the info out of my head. so /uf or /f) which means a forced unregister, wasn't working. The MSI installer package is locking this file.
From my persitence to refresh this registration once again, i removed the lock from the registry by removing the key:
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\Installer\Assemblies\Global]
de-register works. re-register works also.

After this worked, i saw other errors. One of them pointed me at the WCF data components. I could imagine that the newtonsoft.json dll was referenced here also. So first i tried a reconfigure, but it required a fresh install. This fixes more errors in the event viewer.

But what seems later, after doing some testing. And the need for reinstalling the AzureCP module (i will come back with the reason below), it seems that after removing / uninstalling the CP module, the newtonsoft.json is also uninstalled.
So when this happens, or after a reboot, you get weird errors. Not strange at all, but if you're not awaire, you must do some investigation.

After knowing this, i fixed the dll again. Not yet restored the registry lock yet, but first did some ""sharepoint configuration wizard"". This one showed other errors. First time run, it run weird (only the option to disconnect from the farm) and a lot errors (before restoring the newtonsoft dll). 
later on (now the .dll was restored) some error that make more sense. They can be split in two area's. 

part1: MSI installer locations nog available:
did a fresh download, made the locations available again, and a lot of reconfiguring happend. (probably some requirements of updates).

part2: content databases which wheren't upgraded yet:
It seems that the movement, migration, upgrade? was done. But after some patching, or after the upgrade to the SP2016 enviroment, there were some databases pending upgrade.

There where some features missing, old references, which aren't used anymore.

So i used: FeatureAdmin from: https://github.com/achimismaili/featureadmin
great tool! After doing some fixing, checks, and cleanup, i was able te do a succesfull sharepoint configuration wizard.
Afterwards, i could the db upgrade by the specified commands in the eventviewer and some information i worked out (sorry, didn't stored the references) but it was the inplace upgrade of the content DB.

After finishing all this, i rebooted the server, and everything was fine. ""Clean"" event log or at least for what was possible.

From this point, we created a new back-up and started working on the AzureCP tool again. See the information David provided.
Because we can't reproduce the error we started this case with, we do a removal and fresh re-install every time. It seems that the test of adding a user, which should trigger a claim request, is cached. So to make sure we trigger a new request, we re-install the application. Sometime, remove, reboot, and re-install. After the remove, reboot, we had a lot of errors. newtonsoft.json again (grrrr). So restoring the file from the folder you provided on the site, i restored the GAC registry key regarding this file. So it won't be removed again.

I specified as much i can remember, we experencied, so you get a clear view.
In the meanwhile, the server and Sharepoint is patched as far as Windows Update delivers.
So basically, it was a combination of lefover from some patches, hanging dll (re?)registration, and an not upgraded content database. Also missing MSI files which where required to do some re-register / re-install.

For now, we still love to get this one working. I think it's usefuller for future references to open up a new ticket.
But, do you still want to continue with us? Hoping to find a solution to the claim request issues?
The good news here, i will be helping @dvanboven to faster respond to some checks.
Would you like me to open a new ticket? Then we leave this history behind.

Kind regards, Wim

Hi @Yvand ,
I have implemented the AzureCP. Changed the AzureCP configuration to set ""User identifier for 'Guest' users"" to UserPrincipalName. After that, searching for Guest Email address: vishnookumar@gmail.com is not resolving the user in people picker (Eg: when we copy paste the guest user email address). However, pasting the UPN (Eg: vishnookumar_gmail.com#EXT#@vishnoodev.onmicrosoft.com) is resolving the user.

I quickly take a look on changes and don't fully understand how installation of AzureCP + cert auth will look like ...
https://github.com/Yvand/AzureCP/compare/implement-cert-authN

Current code use hardcoded  `ClientCertificatePrivateKeyPassword`, this is probably covered by `it still needs work` 😊

1. How do you see installation guide? (what admin will have to do to configure cert auth)
1. Are you sure that Exportable certificate and private key stored in SharePoint is the best option?

Not sure how to easily do it on all  WFE at once, but it should be possible to
- `Import-PfxCertificate -CertStoreLocation Cert:\LocalMachine\My ...` (on all machines)
- Grant access to use private key only for specific account (that are used for  IIS app pools)
- Every time when we need cert - extract it from store by thumbprint.

p.s.

While using the Windows certificate store is technically feasible, it has significant drawbacks:

- The administrator must ensure that the certificate is present in all SharePoint servers, with proper permissions.
- The list of accounts that need access to the private key is potentially large: all SharePoint processes may use AzureCP, and not only: PowerShell scripts may also use AzureCP (through SharePoint API). It makes such a list hard to maintain, especially across multiple machines.

Considering this, I decided to store the private key in the persisted object that holds AzureCP configuration. The benefits are:

- Setting/updating the certificate is centralized and super easy: the admin just needs to give the certificate to AzureCP.
- Currently, yes it uses a hardcoded password, but the level of security is strictly the same as it is today with the client secret, which is stored in clear text in the configuration database.

With that said, I realize it's bad to use a hardcoded password to store a private key, but I'm not an expert on security and I don't know how to use a secure password that does not depend on the machine or the account. Maybe using the SharePoint passphrase could be an option, I can dig in this area. Do you have any suggestion?

It also creates a very significant dependency: if for some reason Secure Store stops working, AzureCP also stops working, which would be pretty bad.

Even after deprecation of `Configurable token lifetimes in Azure Active Directory (Preview)`, we will be able to increate `access token lifetimes` (even without Azure AD Premium).

This means that we can increase `access token lifetimes` from default `1h` to lets say `12h` and do not re-login/redirect users every hour (FedAuth cookie will be valid for `12h` as well)

I tested in 2 ways:

- With a PowerShell script:

```powershell
# Create a new self signed certificate with an exportable private key
$clientCert = New-SelfSignedCertificate -DnsName ""AzureCPClientCertificate"" -CertStoreLocation ""cert:\LocalMachine\My"" -KeyExportPolicy Exportable -KeySpec Signature

# Get an existing certificate. To work, its private key must be present and exportable
$clientCert = Get-ChildItem -Path ""cert:\localMachine\my"" | ?{$_.Subject -like ""CN=AzureCPClientCertificate""}

# Update tenant to use the certificate
Add-Type -AssemblyName ""AzureCP, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=65dc6b5903b51636""
$config = [azurecp.AzureCPConfig]::GetConfiguration(""AzureCPConfig"")
$tenant = $config.GetAzureTenantByName(""TENANTNAME.onMicrosoft.com"")
$tenant.UpdateCredentials($clientCert)
$config.Update()
```

- Directly with a .pfx file. I don't remember that I had any problem with a .pfx file though. I assumed it always works since it contains the private key (and I assume is exportable by design).
I created my .pfx files from the certificates MMC console, how did you create yours?

In a given process instance, AzureCP works fine for some time until, for some reason, it refreshes its config despite the version didn't change, and fails at the step of importing the certificate.
Is this correct? Is it always this behavior?

If so, can you provide the AzureCP logs which illustrate exactly this? They should contain the following sequence:

- A refresh of the config for a given version (ex. v1)
- Access token using certificate successfully retrieved
- A successful Graph operation (a dump search in the people picker)
- The unexpected refresh of the config with the same version (ex. v1)
- And the error when importing the private key

After seen the query passes to AAD ((UserPrincipalName eq 'hdi@xxxxx.com' and UserType eq 'Member') ), figure out that, some users which are giving error ""user does not exist or not unique "" do not have the user type property populated.   Now i want to find a solution to validate selected user from suggestions list  while resolve before hitting share button to avoid that exception or populate user type property on azure AD.

The duplicate result is another issue separate from this , it happens when you search from surname , it populates a list of users only with surname as display name. when you have many users with same surname get confused to see many duplicates.

The reason why AzureCP does not return O365 groups is that when it gets group membership of the user, it sets ""securityEnabledOnly: true"", which excludes them.
I tested with the [Graph explorer](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/graph-explorer) to set ""securityEnabledOnly: false"" and it includes O365 groups as you would expect.

So I can change the code to retrieve them, or make this customizable by the administrator.
What do you think?

IMHO, a switch on the global configuration page allowing non-security-enabled groups to autocomplete/resolve might be best, with a blurb mentioning ""O365 groups must be security-enabled, etc"" on the control.

$oldlogin=""i:0#.w|contoso\user1"";
$newlogin=""i:05.t|contoso.local|user1@contoso.local"";
[Microsoft.SharePoint.Administration.SPFarm]::Local.MigrateUserAccount($oldlogin, $newlogin, $false);
```

This will migrate Windows user ""user1"" to the trusted authentication mode in the whole farm

The majority of our invited external guest users are capable of authenticating with the constructed claim string without the #EXT#.

As for your question regarding the errors, yes, this is something that can be regenerated and happens each time we use the new-spuser cmdlet and for all guest accounts regardless of the guest account being with or without a tenancy.

As I mentioned earlier, we do not run into this problem if the PnP cmdlet ""Add-PnPUserToGroup"" is used.

We can solve certain issues with joining guest accounts to SharePoint groups with the Add-PnPUserToGroup, but not all.

The actually configuration was troublesome from a proxy persepective as previously documented earlier in my initial regestration of the issue. That was resolved as you know by securing that proxy was turned off and that the .config file edited to contain **defaultProxy useDefaultCredentials=""true""** , this resolved the initial problem in regards to accessing the tenant token while testing the connection.

Shortly after, our attempts at automating failed when using **New-SPuser** resulting in the error messages listed above  in my previous post, simultaneously using the people picker from within the GUI functioned every single time and was successful.

PnP is implemented to help with complex provisioning and management of routines.
When connect-PnPonline cmdlet is executed it is done locally and **NOT** by using the ""**UseWebLogin**"" switch.

**Connect-PnPOnline -Url https://SharePoint.url.com -Credentials $cred
Add-PnPUserToGroup -LoginName ""i:05.t|BlaBlaBla|external_user@external_domain.com"" -Identity ""SharePointGroup01""**

When **Add-PnPUserToGroup** cmdlet is used, the Azure guest user can be imidiately added to a group as long as the invited user object resides in Azure even if the invited user has not accepted the invitation yet and the ""**UserState**"" is still ""**PendingAcceptance**"".

So in conclusion your proposal to using New-SPuser fails but Add-PnPUserToGroup functions flawlessly.
This as a work around is OK, but as a stable solution to recommend for the production environment it is not. 
We cannot explain the sporadic behaviour as long as we have not located the reason behind the error.

What does Add-PnPUserToGroup do differently than New-SPuser in its attempt at locating the user object within Azure via AzureCP ?

The 'username@mmwebs.biz' is being sent through AzureCP, but in the site when we are adding the user are found as 'username_mmwebs.biz#ext#@tenantname.onmicrosoft.com' via the address book, thus getting the SharePoint Message ""This site has not been Shared with you"".

I believe I have the same problem. It seems that there is no consistency in the UPN set within the SAML token presented to SharePoint by the Azure AD Enterprise Application.

I am using AzureCP primarily for Guest account access to my on-prem SharePoint 2016 environment. I am getting a mix of UPN's being presented for Guest users, some in the ""username_domain.com#ext#@tenantname.onmicrosoft.com"" format and some in the ""username@domain.com"" format.

Many of these Guest accounts have their own Office 365 tenancies which I believe may be causing the issue. I have not had enough time to fully test all scenarios but believe that if a Guest account has an Office 365 tenancy and also has an Exchange mailbox in Office 365 then the UPN is presented in the ""username@domain.com"" format within the SAML token. In all other scenarios the UPN is presented in the ""username_domain.com#ext#@tenantname.onmicrosoft.com"" format within the SAML token.

I have managed to work around this by switching the ""User identifier for 'Guest' users"" to ""Mail"" within the AzureCP global configuration and then using PowerShell to add the users Mail UPN to the site collection:
`New-SPUser -UserAlias 'i:0e.t|azuread|username@domain.com' -Web 'https://ourdomain.com/sites/sitecollection/'
`
`Set-SPUser -Identity 'i:0e.t|azuread|username@domain.com'  -Web 'https://ourdomain.com/sites/sitecollection/'  -Group 'Site Visitors'`
After this I then revert the ""User identifier for 'Guest' users"" setting back to ""UserPrincipalName"" in the AzureCP global configuration.

After this I now have both permissions set for either UPN:
i:0e.t|azuread|username@domain.com
i:0e.t|azuread|username_domain.com#ext#@tenantname.onmicrosoft.com
This way if the user logs in with either, they will still have the correct permissions set. This is however not ideal as it requires a SharePoint Admin to configure all Guest permissions.

Could I have configured something incorrectly? Or is there a way to make sure all Guest users are consistently authenticated?

If my recolections are correct here are some prerequisite (@bartbilliet can you re-read):
- federate authentication from SharePoint to one tenant (main tenant)
- naturaly you should add the main tenant as well and show guests for this one
- to be able to use people picker you should add other tenant to azurecp but you need to hide guest accounts for them
- for the authentication of a B2B user to be successfull you need to make sure the invitation was successfull (i.e. share a ressource from you main tenant and check access. SharePoint Online could do it. Or check with Azure AD)

A (few) word on why all this (mainly hide guest for secondary tenants):

It seems that when authenticating with Azure AD B2B there are two situations.
- When you are a B2B user from another tenant the token_id will contain your proper UPN.
- When you are a B2B user from a public account (i.e. Microsoft Account liken hotmail or live.com, or a gmail account) you get a token_id containing the UPN of the guest user in your primary tenant. This UPN contains ""#ext#"".

So for SharePoint this does mean that access rights and user definition should be set accordingly. Which is admittedly kind of a mess. Especially so when using people picker with only one main tenant known.
The reason is that people picker will use the UPN from the account selected in it. And with only one main tenant this allways returns the upns with ""#ext#"". This is not a problem for Microsoft Accounts but for accounts from other tenant thiis does break things.

To alleviate that we added:
- the possibility to address other tenants
- the possibility to say for which guest accounts should be shown
- a decorelation between guest accounts (if a UPN without ""#ext#"" does exist for a user hide any other users with the same UPN but with ""#ext#"")

This will allow you to set rights correctly in a SharePoint with AzureCP. Naturally the limitation is that you should have contact or access to administration of other tenants because AzureCP needs access to their directory for the feature mentionned.",NA,https://api.github.com/repos/Yvand/AzureCP/issues/45/comments,https://github.com/Yvand/AzureCP/issues/45#issuecomment-450624631,https://api.github.com/repos/Yvand/AzureCP/issues/45

If that is so, in the short term:
- Consider to vote/comment on the entry
- Starting with AzureCP 13, you can choose what attribute to use for Guest account: 
  - By default it uses ""mail"": it works only with B2B Guest accounts (accounts that exist in another AAD tenant)
  - You can change to UserPrincipalName instead: it will work only with MSA Guest accounts (e.g. Hotmail/Gmail accounts)

In the future, Azure AD team needs to fix this by using a unified attribute for all Guest accounts (which should always be the email address).

Either way, we are having issues that are guests from custom domains.  They are missing the #ext#.  They get through to SharePoint, but because the UPN with the #ext# is not in SharePoint users are getting ""This site has not been shared with you""",NA,https://api.github.com/repos/Yvand/AzureCP/issues/45/comments,https://github.com/Yvand/AzureCP/issues/45#issuecomment-451040257,https://api.github.com/repos/Yvand/AzureCP/issues/45

By adding the tenant of the custom domain you know of, you can add access to users directly from their azure ad without the ""#ext#"" and they get access properly.
The limitation is that you need to have access to the tenant azure ad to enumerate users.

@Yvand is right in saying that the solution lies within the azure ad team.

They should provide either:
- a way to distinguish MSA accounts from the graph api. I say that because on the azure portal on the azure ad users page, you can see the source of the user: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/b2b/user-properties#after-invitation-redemption
- seemless usage of attribute: as @Yvand has proposed in the uservoice, attributes should be consistent. Be it mail or upn, the value recieve in the token should match the one in azure ad.

I voted on the [uservoice](https://feedback.azure.com/forums/169401-azure-active-directory/suggestions/36274663-sign-in-to-sharepoint-2016-with-guest-accounts-is) as this make much sense but i think that this is practically difficult tothe azure ad team, otherwise they would have done it this way.

Having the ""source"" attribute in graph api may provide a way to handle MSA account programmatically in AzureCP. Some work from microsoft is still needed there also.

In the enterprise application in Azure AD: set claim types name / NameIdentifier to user.mail (instead of user.userprincipalname), this will fix the inconsistent usage of “#EXT#” for Guest accounts.
For this to work:

- AAD Connect must be configured to sync mail property of AD OnPrem users
- Azure AD cloud users don’t have their property mail set by default, so it must be set explicitly otherwise they won’t be able to sign-in.
- In AzureCP, set the ""user identifier"" of both Members and Guests to “Mail” in AzureCP global configuration page.

I found that the issue was also lying withing my SPTrustedIdentityTokenIssuer SPClaimTypeMapping configuration.

Previously I had configured my SPTrustedIdentityTokenIssuer like this:

`$realm = ""urn:sharepoint:URL""`
`$wsfedurl=""https://login.microsoftonline.com/GUID/wsfed""`
`$filepath=""D:\Temp\latest.cer""`
`$cert = New-Object System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509Certificate2($filepath)
New-SPTrustedRootAuthority -Name ""AzureAD"" -Certificate $cert`

`$map = New-SPClaimTypeMapping -IncomingClaimType ""http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/name"" -IncomingClaimTypeDisplayName ""name"" -LocalClaimType ""http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/upn""`
`$map2 = New-SPClaimTypeMapping -IncomingClaimType
""http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/givenname"" -IncomingClaimTypeDisplayName ""GivenName"" -SameAsIncoming`
`$map3 = New-SPClaimTypeMapping -IncomingClaimType ""http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/surname"" -IncomingClaimTypeDisplayName ""SurName"" -SameAsIncoming`
`$ap = New-SPTrustedIdentityTokenIssuer -Name ""AzureAD"" -Description ""SharePoint secured by Azure AD"" -realm $realm -ImportTrustCertificate $cert -ClaimsMappings $map,$map2,$map3 -SignInUrl $wsfedurl -IdentifierClaim ""http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/name""`

However after mapping the incoming claim type for emailaddress to the local claim type upn it then started working as expected. Here is what I did to resolve the issue:

`$realm = ""urn:sharepoint:URL""`
`$wsfedurl=""https://login.microsoftonline.com/GUID/wsfed""`
`$filepath=""D:\Temp\latest.cer""`
`$cert = New-Object System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509Certificate2($filepath)
New-SPTrustedRootAuthority -Name ""AzureAD"" -Certificate $cert`

`$map = New-SPClaimTypeMapping -IncomingClaimType ""http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/emailaddress"" -IncomingClaimTypeDisplayName ""emailaddress"" -LocalClaimType ""http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/upn""`
`$map2 = New-SPClaimTypeMapping -IncomingClaimType ""http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/givenname"" -IncomingClaimTypeDisplayName ""GivenName"" -SameAsIncoming`
`$map3 = New-SPClaimTypeMapping -IncomingClaimType ""http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/surname"" -IncomingClaimTypeDisplayName ""SurName"" -SameAsIncoming`
`$ap = New-SPTrustedIdentityTokenIssuer -Name ""AzureAD"" -Description ""SharePoint secured by Azure AD"" -realm $realm -ImportTrustCertificate $cert -ClaimsMappings $map,$map2,$map3 -SignInUrl $wsfedurl -IdentifierClaim ""http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/emailaddress""`

The only issue I have now is that when a new user gets added to a SharePoint group the ""Work Email"" field is not set so the user does not get an email invitation.

I was thinking of adding another SPClaimTypeMapping by adding the following to my script:

`$map1 = New-SPClaimTypeMapping -IncomingClaimType ""http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/emailaddress"" -IncomingClaimTypeDisplayName ""emailaddress"" -SameAsIncoming`

But not sure if I can use duplicate IncomingClaimType's?

I'm interested to see how others have setup their SPTrustedIdentityTokenIssuer and if there is an easier way to add, remove and change claim type mappings. I'm aware that AzureCP has a Claims Types Config but not sure of the best way to set it up. Does anyone have a screenshot of a working AzureCP Claim Types Config?

Here is a screenshot of my working AzureCP Claim Types Config (apart form the email invitation functionality):

`/users?$filter=(startswith(UserPrincipalName, 'aad') and memberOf eq 'GroupID')`

Assuming group membership whitelisting in this case:
Maybe a way to do this would be to list members of whitelisted groups via [transitiveMembers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/group-list-transitivemembers?view=graph-rest-beta&tabs=http).

The first conclusion would be that application logic would then be different whether or not groups are given.

I think this could be solved by modifiying the object on which the user/group list are done. both the user endpoint and the group/<id>/transitiveMembers supports odata filtering.

Naturally one returns Users and the other directoryObjects: let's see the bright side, this may be a way to get users and groups in one request and use the [directoryObject](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/directoryobject-get?view=graph-rest-beta&tabs=http) enpoint when no groups are provided.

1*: seems like membership filering is done after the request now. i will look if this was always so and eventually why it changed.

The step outlined by aboredman <https://github.com/aboredman> worked for
the login, we are using mainly Guest access so it should be fine.  We still
have one issue and that is, how do we extract the mapped information, eg.
phone number or email for the user?

Indeed, Nito.AsyncEx is not strongly signed and you need to do it yourself. This is the goal of package [Nivot.StrongNaming](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Nivot.StrongNaming/1.0.4.2) that is also part of the solution.
**Important**: you need to create your own private key to sign both AzureCP.dll and Nito.AsyncEx assemblies. This will generate a new AzureCP.dll with a public key different from the one in AzureCP.wsp package. 
For this reason, to avoid all possible confusions, I strongly recommend that you completely retract AzureCP.wsp solution before you deploy yours.

I took a very quick look at the changes, you seem to duplicate the code just to get tenant details, while I think this could be done in a separate task in QueryAzureADAsync() method, what do you think?

Your own version of AzureCP.dll has a different public key token because you created your own private key to sign it (and create a strong named assembly).

In short, this error means that something tries to load the AzureCP.dll, so it is very likely that you did not completely uninstall the standard AzureCP.wsp package before you deployed your custom version (which overwrote all feature AzureCP deployed).

This is why I strongly recommended that you completely uninstall standard AzureCP.wsp before you start deploying your custom version.

Now the environment is a little bit messy. To fix it, I would suggest that you try the following;
- Completely retract and remove custom/standard AzureCP.wsp currently deployed
- Visit [this page](http://ldapcp.com/Fix-setup-issues.html) to make sure there is no AzureCP artifact left, and delete them if that's the case
**Note**: this page is for LDAPCP, but the principle is exactly the same for AzureCP, juste replace ""LDAPCP"" with ""AzureCP""
- Once it's cleaned, deploy only your custom version of AzureCP.wsp

Still need to get back the config of all the tenants used to test but i can run the compiled version of AzureCP :-).

Now people picker does work well with a single tenant.

Your logic assumes that nobody will ever want to add a guest user if he is in a registered domain. Are you 100% sure about that?

Besides, your logic works for search (e.g. find everyone starting with ""user"") since it consists of removing results from the list.

But SharePoint may want to validate such guest users (e.g. return 1 PickerEntity for ""userX@domain.net""), which won't work anymore. This can't happen with your current implementation, but think about:
- Administrators who already deployed a previous version of AzureCP and added such guest users that you now exclude
- Administrators who may want to add such guest users anyway (back to my initial question)

One way to resolve this is to add a switch to the AzureCP admin page to enable/disable your filtering.
But still I'm very interested if it could make sense, in some scenario, to want to add guest users that are in a registered domain. What do you think?

On a side note, I wonder if we could find a better implementation of AzurecpResult, so that it could properly contain domains too, current solution works but it really looks like a quick & dirty solution.

As per #3 B2B is kinda difficult. Works for microsoft accounts (MSA: google, hotmail) but not for B2B accounts between AADs.
The problem seems here to be in the claims forwarded by AAD.

So with this B2B between AADs you can pick the user from the picker but the access will be given to an ""*#ext#@*.onmicrosoft.com"" (* is a wildcard) but AAD with send the real mail address as identity.
For MSA it will provider the right claim so when invited you can pick it.

We do want people picker, otherwise just bypassing AAD lookup would have been suffisient.

We do also feel that people trying to use AzureCP with guest users have a hard time having it properly for both MSA and B2B between AADs.

Remember that the filter will only be effective if you have multiple tenant. We can discuss it, but i see no situation where you will invite in AAD a user from your own tenant.

In the end we do think that the filter is a good idea: 
it would prevent to give access that won't work.

Upgrade is a no brainer if you have only one AAD. If you have multiple AAD you might be pleased to 
- remove any modification made on claims in AzureCP and/or ADFS
- have a solution that works for all B2B users (MSA and B2B between AADs)
- have a clean people picker.

Inviting a guest user (""#ext#"") from your known AADs? Really?  

I realy hope i can convice you that this filter is nothing bad.

I will nevertheless look at configuration if ok with you:
other than bypassing the filter, being able to indicate which AAD is federated with ADFS is usefull to prevent returning guest users from tenants that are not (the guest account needs to exist in a federated AAD to work)

I may also look further on AzurecpResult:
Maybe one result per tenant search containing a domain list and a directory object list might be better. than a raw object list.

Here is my understanding of your design:
- A AAD Guest user won't be removed if his original domain (retrieved from his email) is not found in another AAD tenant registered in AzureCP.
- Only AAD Guest users that have their email suffix matching another AAD tenant registered in AzureCP are removed from results.

My main concern was if there would be any reason to not remove them, and you convinced me that no.
But in your last commit you added an option to activate/deactivate this filtering.
Does that mean you think otherwise now?

Note: I found [this article about B2B users](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/active-directory-b2b-user-properties), it helps me to better understand the differences between Guests and Members.

Notice the last commit doesn't remove the filter.

What is does is indicate to only search for member user or all users for each tenant.

**Why doing that?**

The main scenario we are looking at is as follows:

```asciiart
                                           +----------------+
   +........AzureCP AAD Graph API..........| AAD seconday 1 | 
   :                                :     /+----------------+ 
+----+ SAML 1.0 +------+ SAML 2.0 +-------------+     +----------------+
| SP | -------- | ADFS | -------- | AAD primary |-B2B-| Guest Accounts |
+----+          +------+          +-------------+     +----------------+
   :                                      \+-----------------+
   +........AzureCP AAD Graph API..........| AAD secondary 2 |
                                           +-----------------+
```

What i know:
Guest can be in any tenants.
AAD can only authentify users he knows, is this a Member or a Guest.

If guest from a secondary tenant tries to login to sharepoint (s)he will be redirected to the primary AAD. 
This AAD will complain that there is no account for the guest user. 
Even if invited on both tenants, the guest will have a different UPN in both (guest1_gmail.com#ext#@Alice.onMicrosoft.com and guest1_gmail.com#ext#@Bob.onMicrosoft.com)

Federating to multiple AADs is possible. 

> REM: 
>
> This is some work to register sharepoint in each AAD.
> This will get confusing for guest users at home real discovery.
> The only advantage i see is lessen the invitation work

```asciiart
   ,....AAD Graph API..,
   :                   :
   :                +-------+   +----------------+
   :                | AAD 1 | - | Guest Accounts |
+----+    +------+ /+-------+   +----------------+
| SP | -- | ADFS |     | (optional B2B)
+----+    +------+ \+-------+   +----------------+
   :                | AAD 1 | - | Guest Accounts |
   :                +-------+   +----------------+
   :                   :
   '....AAD Graph API..'
```

So what i conclude:
**Guest users should only be used on AAD federated with Sharepoint**

Indicating with wich AAD a Sharepoint (trought ADFS) is federated allows to filter out guest users that should not be given access.

Can you ignore this error, add the connection and test directly the people picker?
You can monitor AzureCP activity in SharePoint logs if you filter on Product/Area ""AzureCP""
If people picker doesn't work, can you try to update AzureCP<https://yvand.github.io/AzureCP/Update-AzureCP.html> with the latest Beta, which you can download here<https://github.com/Yvand/AzureCP/releases/tag/v10.Beta>?

Basicaly, we want to user AzureAD for sharepoint on permises and leverage B2B as well as MSA (i.e: hotmail).

We spotted few points that we would like to be able to handle:
1/Invitation
Authorization does work correctly for the different kind of users. but every user needs an account in azure ad, right. In B2B a guest would have a shadow account. 
So users needs to be first invited into azure ad before rights can be set to them in sharepoint. We are debating the use of an invitation portal that would allow to invite extern people. A example page does exist for that (https://github.com/Azure/active-directory-dotnet-graphapi-b2bportal-web if i am right).
We can't avoid feeling that there should be a more sharepoint integrated solution to that.
2/Groups
We wouldn't want to recreate groups from B2B tennants to provide access so we want to use claims enrichments to collect groups from the original tenant of B2B users (provided they are in an AzureAD).
To allow management from sharepoint we decided to configure extra azuread in azurecp thus allowing picking of extra groups.
3/People Picker
So we end up with a ""main"" azure ad which handles user authentication as well as B2B and MSA. But in people picker both the shadow account and the real account shows up. As discussed in another issue, B2B does work with a claims modification on ADFS level (from #ext to normal upn). But this modification might not be welcome for MSA accounts.
In the end we tought possible to filter out ""shadow"" accounts from B2B users and only use the information form their native tenant if provided by an azure ad (i.e. main tenant emailaddress match another known tenant upn).

So:
- invitation process: we may have to look in another direction
- shadow accounts: we d'like to correlate shadow account and account from other known tenants to detect shadows and hide them.

thank you for the detailed description, it makes much more sense now.
Technically speaking what you describe sounds possible, but it's a big work to do.
To be honest, I have other priorities and I don't think I'm going to invest time to implement this. The most important change I'd like to make is to rely on Microsoft Graph instead of the old Azure Active Directory Graph Client Library ([as described here](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.ActiveDirectory.GraphClient/)), but even that I don't know if/when I'll have time to do.

With that said, if you have the resources and the time, you could try to implement this on your own. I think it is possible by just inheriting AzureCP, if I create an overridable method (in AzureCP class) that is called after all AAD users/groups were found, so you can add/remove the ones you want.

Thanks for your comment to flyingMagnus,  I also have the same query which you answered partially but the other half which i am not able to understand is that -- as of now if we need to configure and connect Azure CP with out Sharepoint 2013 as Custonm Claims Provider, we give info (screenshot attached) like Provider URI, ProviderRealms, UPN etc  but when you create  Azure AD application, we dont create all these.
Apart from this, the certificate which we extract was from ws federation metadata xml file and extracting the certificate inside the tag  signing and x509 . In Azure AD, if  I see the WS federation metadata xml file  I see 3 seperate entries each inside a signing and x509.

Bit Lost ... Can you please throw some light on this or any document for me to refer ?

AzureCP can fix the display name of users if:
- User is added for the very first time in the site collection (if user was deleted and is re-added this won't work)
- In central admin > Security > AzureCP claims mapping page: a Graph property has the Metadata ""DisplayName"" set

But, whatever you configure this or not, the User Profile Application service is the component that synchronizes the display name from the User Profiles to the site collections.
So if your trusted users have a valid user profile in the UPA, their display name will be synced from this profile.

First of all, thanks for getting back to me, I appreciate it.


I think I didn't explain the issue I am facing correctly; We are using B2B user accounts as such the UPN for these account types are a bit strange in the back end ""test.user_domain.com.au#EXT#@tenantname.onmicrosoft.com"" the same format that is stored for MS accounts


as such with the Claims configuration set to ""UPN -> UserPrincibleName"" (below)

[cid:9a4b2c19-9fce-4e58-ade2-ed71797ca3f9]


what we are seeing is that while AzureCP can locate the users in the people pickers etc, the users claim added to SharePoint looks like:

 ""i:0e.t|<claims provider name>|test.user_domain.com.au#EXT#@tenantname.onmicrosoft.com""

 and when the user logs in they are prompted with an access denied error within SharePoint, I suspect this is due to the for mentioned value stored in SP.



When we change the AzureCP configuration to:

[cid:ce82f021-19ae-4e88-ba12-2dabe3f05e87]


Users are still findable in the People pickers (well most - will get to that shortly)

and the user when added to sharepoint looks like:

 ""i:0e.t|<claims provider name>|test.user@domain.com.au"" as what normal users do with a normal UPN local accounts.

Issue is that when configured this way it works for B2B Guest accounts, but breaks accounts of type:  Local Account (onmicrosoft.com).

Any advice would be great!


-Ben

AzureCP expects that you always use property UserPrincipalName for users, because AAD sets the main claim type (http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/name<https://apac01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fschemas.xmlsoap.org%2Fws%2F2005%2F05%2Fidentity%2Fclaims%2Fname&data=01%7C01%7Cben.pearce%40ignia.com.au%7Cc9d68acd88c64f14bcc508d4503378b2%7Cbc917ae21e64468b936774ed111ac098%7C1&sdata=GIsFg1ZASNl%2Fmgq1fj9Z3HlmrtmJyPEW1JlkMbmz19A%3D&reserved=0>) with this property, and SAML token doesn't contain the email address.

Then in ACS or ADFS, you may transform this claim type in either http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/upn<https://apac01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fschemas.xmlsoap.org%2Fws%2F2005%2F05%2Fidentity%2Fclaims%2Fupn&data=01%7C01%7Cben.pearce%40ignia.com.au%7Cc9d68acd88c64f14bcc508d4503378b2%7Cbc917ae21e64468b936774ed111ac098%7C1&sdata=aBXrlH%2BzxDh5EnxOrlJj4BbHdK%2F8owcHklAxtXevoSM%3D&reserved=0> or http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/emailaddress<https://apac01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fschemas.xmlsoap.org%2Fws%2F2005%2F05%2Fidentity%2Fclaims%2Femailaddress&data=01%7C01%7Cben.pearce%40ignia.com.au%7Cc9d68acd88c64f14bcc508d4503378b2%7Cbc917ae21e64468b936774ed111ac098%7C1&sdata=5ENpPJOAIG1PbQmVRrvb0VwEKVq7iaAPubLZn29FKpk%3D&reserved=0> but it's still the same AAD property (UserPrincipalName).

sorry for the late reply. I reproduced your issue, and you are correct:
- For B2B (guest) users: AAD does not issue claim http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/name that would contain userPrincipalName value (typically ""yvand_external.com#EXT#@TENANT.onmicrosoft.com""), instead it issues claims http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/emailaddress with the actual email of the user.
- For normal (member) users: AAD issues claim http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/name that contains userPrincipalName value (typically ""AzureUser1@TENANT.onmicrosoft.com""), and it does not issue email claim.

On the other hand, AzureCP always sets the identity permission with the userPrincipalName value, so indeed this doesn't work for B2B users since AAD does not send this attribute.
Are you using ACS or ADFS between SharePoint and AAD?

A possible solution that does not require any change on AzureCP is to configure ADFS to retrieve the userPrincipalName of the B2B users and issue it with the identity claim type set on SharePoint.
This solution cannot be done with ACS.
Does this sound like a possible solution for you?

Sorry i took a while to respond,

Your proposed solution via ADFS unfortunately defeats the purpose of the entire B2B model. B2B (Business to business) is designed to users can sign in using their own organisations credentials, so as such they will be authenticating against THIER OWN ADFS server, currently my client has 170+ business partners connecting via B2B, so you can understand we could not expect all 170 partners to modify their ADFS on their side.  Unfortunately only solution i can see, requires a change to AzureCP.

Is this something that you think would be possible?

sorry I should have given some justification:
This is an actual issue, but I closed it because I don't see any possible solution on AzureCP side.

I think this should be addressed on ADFS side: create custom rules on ADFS to change the claim type type of B2B accounts from http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/name to whatever the identity claim type is in SharePoint (e.g. http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/emailaddress).

For example we invite a user from company 'xyz' ""user@xyz.com' to use our system. they are logging in using their infrastructure, they may have ADFS installed in their environment but we can not re-configure that.  They may not, and just be using default o365 login's without ADFS even in the picture.

To me it seems like a relatively easy fix from the software side of things, as the workaround described above could be added as default behavior of the plug in no? (I know that's simplifying it somewhat).

Like if use both UserPrincipalName and Mail attributes at the same time, rather than us only allowing one to be selected, as that's the crutz of the issue.

I do understand the issue, and I was not suggesting that you fix the issue in the ADFS of your customers.

About your flow, I think it is like this because you use ACS, can you confirm this?
In this case yes, you are probably in a deadend.

But instead of ACS you could use ADFS of your organization. In this case, all SAML tokens of all users would go to ADFS and you could do some transformation to change the claim types when needed.

The problem was SamAccountName and Email were both configured as primary claims vs as secondary mappings (Like how  DisplayName is configured by default)

The solution was to delete the email & samAcountName configurations and add them back in using 'New Item' in the Claims configuration page, then using the 'add a mapping between a LDAP object and the main corresponding object type' 

Now when the user is selected they are added with the primary identifier claims as a User object.

As you can see in the picture, it pulls distinguished name, strips the string and extracts just the name of the group from it.

If I do a lookup for this group in AD using PowerShell. This is what I get. I can never search it using the name, I must use the SamAccountName.

The reason for this design is that the LDAP object available here is the user. The only info LDAPCP has about the groups is their DistinguishedName values in property memberof of the user.
To actually set the claim value of groups with their samAccountName, LDAPCP would need to do 1 additional LDAP query for each group, which may have a significant impact on performance.

A possible alternative is to get the groups using method LDAPCP.GetGroupsFromActiveDirectory(), which should set the claim value of group with their samAccountName. For that you need to check the option ""Use .NET helper (for Active Directory only)"" in LDAPCP global configuration page. Did you consider it?",NA,https://api.github.com/repos/Yvand/LDAPCP/issues/134/comments,https://github.com/Yvand/LDAPCP/issues/134#issuecomment-724753188,https://api.github.com/repos/Yvand/LDAPCP/issues/134

But, it looks like that method does not use secure authentication, the authentication type is set to None. Hence any calls to my directory simply fails to query anything or maybe the filter is incorrect.

See the ULS logs below after setting the setting to use .NET Helper method.

As you can see, it completes the query in 0ms, which does not seem normal to me. Like you said, I figured that I will have to do one additional query if I use 'Query this Server' setting instead of 'Use .NET helper' setting.

I created it multiple times. Still it did not work, hence switched back to Query LDAP Server option.

I was debugging the code to see what was going on. In LDAPCP.cs, I noticed you put a comment. See below line.

```
// BUG: Filters must be set in an object created in this method (to be bound to current thread), otherwise filter may be updated by multiple threads
List<LDAPConnection> ldapServers = new List<LDAPConnection>(this.CurrentConfiguration.LDAPConnectionsProp.Count);
```

the ldapServers object is empty, hence the query is failing since there are no LDAP servers to query.

`CurrentConfiguration.LDAPConnectionsProp.Count` object does show a count = 1, but the instantiation of the object(`new List<LDAPConnection>`) is not working.  It is empty after the debugger goes to next line.

What filter were you inferring to when you said // BUG: Filters must be set in an object created in this method ?
Any idea, why it would fail to instantiate ?

EDIT : I figured what was going on, the foreach loop following the line mentioned above

```
 foreach (LDAPConnection ldapServer in this.CurrentConfiguration.LDAPConnectionsProp.Where(x => x.EnableAugmentation))
                    {
                        ldapServers.Add(ldapServer.CopyConfiguration());
                    }
```
Even though i saved the connection with 'Enable augmentation' never gets saved into my persistedobject store in SharePoint.
Hence there is nothing to iterate over as the statement relies on connections where EnableAugmentation = true.

Something seems to be missing tho. None of the users in external.com domain is searchable in peopleplicker.
There is no trust between the domains. I have only opened port 389 and 636 between the SharePoint servers and the external domain controllers. ""Test LDAP connection"" works fine. Could there be other ports involved here, or have I configured ldapcp wrong somehow? Both connections are identical, just pointing to different domains.

Im also very intrested in using role claims for giving access to my site.
Say for example: ""If user belongs to group ""SharePoint Access"", then grant user access. I imagine I could add ""SharePoint Access (role claim) to the visitors-group. But role-claim is not showing in peoplepicker. I suppose I have to activate augmentation? If so - how do I go about solving the problem? :)

I solved the problem by checking the following in the ldap connection:

Hi @Yvand ,
We've decided to install your custom solution. Everything seemed to be working fine and we had no issue with Office Online Server. However, after setting up the custom sign in page to ""/_login/Bypass/BypassLogin.aspx"" and configuring the ""CustomBypassLogin"" farm property (as descried at [https://github.com/Yvand/SPBypassLoginPage](https://github.com/Yvand/SPBypassLoginPage) , search crawl stopped working correctly with the following error : 

> Access is denied. Verify that either the Default Content Access Account has access to this repository, or add a crawl rule to crawl this repository. If the repository being crawled is a SharePoint repository, verify that the account you are using has ""Full Read"" permissions on the SharePoint Web Application being crawled.

Any idea how to fix this ?

Thanks.

As you can see, the errored Servers are listing them selves twice (that might be an 80/443 thing).

Please note third Letter P and **R**.  R's are the added Servers and as you can see, 2 of the 6 say they are successful.

Also, note, SV**R**EXTSPIEAPP1 shows both Error and Successful.

I personally added the .DLL to the GAC this AM on SVREXTSPIEFE2 - restart IIS, and AppPool.  
Cannot Browse to Security Token Service (80 or 443).

Even on SV**R**EXTSPIEFE1 cannot Browse to Securty Token Service.

Should I install the LDAPCP.WSP on each server (even though it is a Farm SOlution and is working on all the ""P"" Systems in the Farm (Original Farm before additions)?

When I run this on all 6 R Servers, I do get Tokens Returned.
```
Add-PSSnapin *sharepoint*

$farm = [Microsoft.SharePoint.Administration.SPFarm]::Local

$webServiceCollection = new-object Microsoft.SharePoint.Administration.SPWebServiceCollection($farm)

foreach ($service in $webServiceCollection)

$context = $firstWebApp.GetResponseUri([Microsoft.SharePoint.Administration.SPUrlZone]::Default)

AS a consequence, we have got a new issue.
 - User name seem's to have change. As a consequence, access based on group on site collection are broken. In a new Site collection, it's ok. How do we force sync or reset group on site collection?
Another question, why do a mail notification on an external account (not on our AD) always work even if email aren't  indicated on User profile Application.

My environment:

- two active directories (intranet and extranet), each with one ADFS server

- the extranet ADFS server is configured as relying party trust on the intranet ADFS server
- the intranet ADFS server in turn is configured as trusted claims provider on the extranet server

LDAPCP is configured to lookup into both ADs.

Indeed, you cannot use LDAPCP with 2 SPTrustedIdentityTokenIssuer, this is actually due to a SharePoint limitation.
The solution is to use 2 flavors of LDAPCP: one is the pure standard one, the other is basically LDAPCP with a different, unique name (e.g. CustomLDAPCP). Each has its unique configuration (persisted object) and name.

But as I based my providers on your Developers sample, it seems that the current version of the ldapcp.dll from October 7th 2019 does not match with the configuration pages located in /admin/ldapcp_custom (8/2018) in the LDAPCP.Developers.zip.
The result is, that the property ""IdProp"" can't be found during databinding when opening the configuration page. Maybe it has been renamed to ""Identifier"" in the current version? At wich version was it changed and are there more changes in the code like that?

In LDAPCP claims mapping page, the row in green corresponds to the identity claim type configured in the SPTrustedIdentityTokenIssuer.

Subject: Re: [Yvand/LDAPCP] AD Group/Role issue (#103)


@schrockmatthew<https://github.com/schrockmatthew> when working with groups you need to be careful with their claim value.
As you can see in LDAPCP claim types mapping page, by default, LDAPCP uses prefix ""{fqdn}"" for groups. It means that for each value it gets from LDAP server, it adds ""domainFQDN"".
So it LDAP server returns ""group1"", LDAPCP creates permission ""contoso.local\group1""
I don't know if this is the cause of your problem, but you need to compare the value of groups returned by your STS (ADFS) with the value set by LDAPCP. Both must match

I already added one extra LDAP connection to AD OU in our TEST farm, but not sure what account I should use. UserProfleSync is the only account that has Replicating Directory Changes permission on AD, but I believe that's not necessary since LDAPCP needs only to read AD and I can use a ""general"" Sharepoint service account for the LDAP connection.

We have AD Users in three different OUs and AD Groups in two different OUs so I guess I should try to add 5 different LDAP connections straight to those OUs and see if this is right solution.

Can you capture a Fiddler trace, confirm it hangs on the POST to /_trust?
If so, then you can get its correlation ID and use it to filter SharePoint logs. It should help you understand the cause of the hang.

This is because both modes return 1 user, so SharePoint ends up with 2 users while it expects exactly 1.
This is indeed quite unexpected, and it occurs because SharePoint behaves as if it is looking up the value (which means all claims providers may return a result), instead of validating it (which means only the relevant claims provider should return a result).

If you are interested, here are the details about the bug:

## Context
The issue occurs when LDAPCP uses the LDAP (AD) connection of the SharePoint server.
At some point LDAPCP gets the domain name by reading the LDAP property “distinguishedName” from the object DirectoryEntry:

https://github.com/Yvand/LDAPCP/blob/a5c164680f44fbf778446bc91b0f59f887f557a5/LDAPCP/LDAPCPConfig.cs#L1290

Reading this property triggers an authenticated LDAP call to the AD server, using the creds of the application pool account (LDAPCP does privilege elevation).

## Root cause
But this privilege elevation was missing in 2 entry points: in [LDAPCP.GetClaimTypeForUserKey()](https://github.com/Yvand/LDAPCP/blob/a5c164680f44fbf778446bc91b0f59f887f557a5/LDAPCP/LDAPCP.cs#L1916) and [LDAPCP.GetUserKeyForEntity()](https://github.com/Yvand/LDAPCP/blob/a5c164680f44fbf778446bc91b0f59f887f557a5/LDAPCP/LDAPCP.cs#L1948).
So from those methods, connection to AD server was attempted as “NT AUTHORITY\IUSR” (the default anonymous account), which of course failed: lsass was issuing a Kerberos TGS to SPN “krbtgt/NT AUTHORITY” (assuming NT AUTHORITY was an AD domain name).
This is what caused the DirectoryServicesCOMException.

## Solution
I added the missing privilege elevation in method LDAPCP.GetUserKeyForEntity():

https://github.com/Yvand/LDAPCP/blob/a5c164680f44fbf778446bc91b0f59f887f557a5/LDAPCP/LDAPCP.cs#L1953-L1956

But doing so in LDAPCP.GetClaimTypeForUserKey() is not possible: it causes a StackOverflowException. 
So to fully fix the issue I implemented a different way to read the domain name in this scenario, and little other improvements.

No, not just with certificate, there will be username/password. I believe current implementation of LDAPCP communicates to LDAP via port 389.

I understand the need for this WebPart, but to be honest, I'm not a big fan of adding it to LDAPCP:

To use the WebPart you must add a SafeControl entry in the web.config. Since you didn't add a feature you assume people would do it manually when they need, but how would they know about it?

We can add a Web Application scoped feature to the solution, but then deploying it would update all web.config files (by default). It's a huge overhead for such WebPart that is useful only to troubleshoot specific issues and would not be used by 99% of users.

Yes, this is possible: the idea is that you define a keywork for a given claim type.
Then, when user types the keyword in the people picker, what is after will be validated as-is. E.g.:
- You set keyword ""ext:"" on claim type email
- In the people picker you type ""ext:email@partner.com"" and LDAPCP validates ""email@partner.com""

Hi @Yvand

We tried to disable LDAPCP augmentation today, but then users who were given access to site via group memberships (Role claim) got access denied error ""This site is not shared with you... ""

Tried to figure out why, and it seems that under LDAPCPs config page ""Claim mapping"", for Role claim, there is defined ""Prefix to display"" with value ""{fqdn}\""
and all groups that were given access to this site by that point have it prepended. 

On the other side Role claim that comes with ADFS tokens consist of group names only (samaccountname), without prefixes. This mismatch caused access denied error.

When the prefix is removed on the ""Claims mapping"" config page, and access to same group is given again, now shown without the prefix, uses are able to acces pages with augmentation disabled.

Now the issue is how to easy convert these prefixes so the site is usable without augmentation. 
Is it possible ho hack it somehow on LDAPCP level or by modifying those claims on ADFS level?
Do you have any ides and is this expected behavior?

Thank you,
Is there any reason why SPFarm.MigrateUserAccount() should be used
comparing to using Move-SPUser ?

In this scenario, the only way is to delete that persisted object, so that LDAPCP creates it again. This is possible using stsadm.exe, located in ""C:\Program Files\Common Files\microsoft shared\Web Server Extensions\15\BIN"":
```
stsadm -o deleteconfigurationobject -id 5D306A02-A262-48AC-8C44-BDB927620227

Then, return to LDAPCP administration page and LDAPCP will create a new persisted object (config).
Note that deleting the persisted object will also delete the existing configuration.

Indeed, by default LDAPCP expects that objectclass of users is ""user"", but you can change this if you delete and recreate the mapping in LDAPCP page ""claims mapping"".

But as you noticed, you cannot specify a different objectclass based on the LDAP server it is hitting. 

In theory, you could specify a different LDAP filter for each LDAP server if you created a custom version of LDAPCP and override method LDAPCP.GetLDAPFilter().
The method sets the LDAP filter per LDAP server.
The query would work as you wish but it would fail later during the processing of the results, because LDAPCP expects that there is 1 objectclass per object type.
Unfortunately, changing the design to fit your need would be a huge work.

The best solution I can think of is to use an objectclass that would fit all LDAP servers, You can set this objectclass in LDAPCP ""claims mapping"" page for each claim type that represents a user.

I understand the need but this sounds very specific and requires some effort to update the admin page to propose this new setting while not making it confusing.

Besides, you can already do what you want by creating a custom version of LDAPCP and override method GetLDAPServers(RequestInformation). 
Object RequestInformation contains the type of operation (augmentation, search, validation), so you can return a LDAP path different based on that.

You can find more information on http://ldapcp.com/For-Developers.html and practical example in ""LDAPCP.Developers.zip"" that you can find with each [LDAPCP release](https://github.com/Yvand/LDAPCP/releases).

The drawback is that it's of course more work than just deploying LDAPCP, and you would lose the administration pages unless you create additional code to be able to use them with your own claims provider.

LDAPCP does what it is asked by SharePoint: a lookup based on the input (supplied as a string) that should return all results found.
You are hitting a design limit of SharePoint implementation: input as a string always triggers a lookup that can return 1 to many results.

It's only when input is supplied as a SPClaim that (custom) claims provider must return exactly 1 result.

There is nothing that can be done in LDAPCP to mitigate that, except what you already found: force LDAPCP to always do an exact LDAP lookup. But even that may not work if the input (string) matches values of multiple LDAP attributes (e.g. sAMAccountName and givenname, or mail and userPrincipalName).

As the log mentioned, SharePoint expects to use claims provider SPTrustedBackedByActiveDirectoryClaimProvider but since it's LDAPCP, it stops.

SPTrustedBackedByActiveDirectoryClaimProvider is a quite special, hidden claims provider that was implemented to ease migration from Windows claims to trusted authN.
It is never visible or used explicitely, the only way to use it is to create the SPTrustedIdentityTokenIssuer object using the ""-UseDefaultConfiguration"" switch, as documented in [kb3042604](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3042604/the-convert-spwebapplication-command-cannot-convert-from-windows-claim).

So the short answer for you would be to delete the SPTrustedIdentityTokenIssuer and recreate it with the ""-UseDefaultConfiguration"" switch.
This will ""disconnect"" LDAPCP from the trust and link SPTrustedBackedByActiveDirectoryClaimProvider to it instead.

Unfortunately, due to the implementation of SPTrustedBackedByActiveDirectoryClaimProvider, it's very likely not going to work in your scenario: 
the problem is the value used to set the entity key of each entity (aka user):
SPTrustedBackedByActiveDirectoryClaimProvider uses specifically the SID of users (remember it's used to migrate winclaims to trusted authN), but:
- I suspect SharePoint doesn't even get the SID of users in your scenario.
- LDAPCP uses the identity claim type for the entity key.

This difference means that if you switch to SPTrustedBackedByActiveDirectoryClaimProvider, you will mess up your trusted users permissions.

So, I don't know how to resolve your issue, but I would search for a way that doesn't involve using SPTrustedBackedByActiveDirectoryClaimProvider, if possible.

LDAPCP searches an entry with entity 'FormsRole' or 'SecurityGroup', and uses its claim type for the groups it creates if augmentation is enabled.
If there is none, augmentation does not happen.
By default claim type http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/role is set with 'FormsRole', so (if LDACP augmentation is enabled), groups will be created with this claim type.
Does it make sense?

I'm actually just thinking, maybe i screwed up with the claims mapping on the ADFS side. I just added UPN to the active directory mapping, and removed pass-though UPN. I used to following map commands, maybe im specifying the wrong provider

The LDAP search returned 17 results, but one of the user does not have his identity attribute (mail) set, which causes the ArgumentOutOfRangeException exception. This user was found based on its cn, sn or displayname attribute.

I know this is an old post, but just wanted to know if this SID to string feature has been implemented in LDAPCP? =)

I'm currently in a situation where a new organization is moving to use our intranet and they are constantly renaming their AD Groups for various reasons and they have to remove those old AD groups from our Intranet sites and add again with the new names for them to function. They have been using Group SIDs in their old intranet so they have had no issues before with renaming AD groups. I don't know yet if they have had some kind of conversion from SID to string to show the actual Group Names in Sharepoint, but I'm sure that they are not using LDAPCP in their old intranet.

I just found out from a post from another site that this is how it is if using Role claims in ADFS.

You have to make sure the ORDER of your mappings are correct and also the last powershell tag on your command uses -IdentifierClaim $upnclaimmap.InputClaimType  Anotherwords, make sure the UPN is your main claim (Which is what is set in Active Directory for each user) and in the Claim Mapping config in the “Attirbute to display” I use the “cn” (common name) attribute which is their full display name.
