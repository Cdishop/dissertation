<h2>10.3.2 - Oops, &quot;Javascript&quot;.</h2>
<p>Tiny tiny release, just to fix the website incorrectly not listing Javascript
in the list of languages you could choose for a custom build.  NPM and CDN
build should not have been affected so 10.3.1 is effectively the same as
10.3.2 for those builds.</p>
<p>If you made a custom build from the website with 10.3 or 10.3.1 you may
want to check and make sure it includes Javascript, and if not, build it again.</p>
<h2>9.18.1 - Brrrrr, it’s freezing.</h2>
<p>Quick release to resolve <a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/highlightjs/highlight.js/issues/2375"">#2375</a></p>

<h2>Release v9.18.5</h2>
<p><strong>Version 9 has reached end-of-support and will not receive future updates or fixes.</strong></p>
<p>Please see <a href=""https://github.com/highlightjs/highlight.js/blob/master/VERSION_10_UPGRADE.md"">VERSION_10_UPGRADE.md</a> and perhaps <a href=""https://github.com/highlightjs/highlight.js/blob/master/SECURITY.md"">SECURITY.md</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>enh: Post-install script can be disabled with <code>HLJS_HIDE_UPGRADE_WARNING=yes</code></li>
<li>fix: Deprecation notice logged at library startup a <code>console.log</code> vs <code>console.warn</code>.
<ul>
<li>Notice only shown if actually highlighting code, not just requiring the library.</li>
<li>Node.js treats <code>warn</code> the same as <code>error</code> and that was problematic.</li>
<li>You (or perhaps your indirect dependency) may disable the notice with
the <code>hideUpgradeWarningAcceptNoSupportOrSecurityUpdates</code> option</li>
<li>You can also set <code>HLJS_HIDE_UPGRADE_WARNING=yes</code> in your envionment to disable the warning</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre lang=""js""><code>hljs.configure({
  hideUpgradeWarningAcceptNoSupportOrSecurityUpdates: true
})
</code></pre>

## Issue
Our telemetry suggests that your extension uses webviews and may be loading resources in these webviews using hardcoded `vscode-resource:` URIs. These URIs have some important limitations and don't work properly when VS Code is run in a browser. We are also making changes in the desktop version of VS Code that may cause these URIs to not work properly in future versions of VS Code.

While we are making our best effort to continue support existing webview extensions that use `vscode-resource:` URIs on desktop versions of VS Code, we will not able to fully support all uses cases.

## Fix
To ensure that your extension continues to work in as many environments as possible—including on web and remotely—please:

- Switch to use the [`Webview.asWebviewUri` function](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/307cb32f306a527a30a5b1756e8bf548c141192c/src/vs/vscode.d.ts#L6703) for loading resources.

When I start a live share, sometimes the chat tab does not open at all. Sometimes it opens but remains blank. It then seems to be stuck waiting for something. And sometimes it opens normally and I can start typing. Anybody seen this behavior before?

When it opens but remains blank, I tried to close the tab and then click ""Chat channel"" to open it again. But usually, it either opens blank again or doesn't open at all.

It happens when I start a live share, and it also happens when I join a live share. Some days it seems to mostly work, and somedays it never works.

I've never received any error message from the chat.

So that is the first problem, the most severe one. The second problem is the following...

When it does work, I can always see my name in the chat, for all of my posts, but most of the time I don't see the names of the other participant's posts, what I see instead is a user specific hash. Sometimes, I dont even see this hash, all I see in that case is the time of the post. But sometimes, I can see the name of the poster. Am I the only one to experience such erratic behavior?

Moreover, I always see the names of the participants in the LiveShare left side-bar. So the problem appears to be within the chat itself. 

When I join a share, I usually see the name of the share host inside the chat, but the names of the other posters are hashes. Today we made several tests and it happened to me and both other participants. One was on Windows and the other on Linux. So it seems that there is definitely a problem with the chat, it is not just with my setup. But it may be more severe on MacOS, since the other participants told me that their chat always opens normally. 

BTW the audio chat is also intermittent for me, but not for my two coworkers on Windows and Linux. Perhaps it is related. I will file a separate bug report for the audio chat, but here is a summary. On the left side-bar it tells me that I am connected to the audio chat, I can hear the others, but they can't hear me. And then suddenly, today, my machine asked me to allow Electron to access my microphone!? And then, it started to work very well, but not for every session. Again there is something flaky. When it doesn't work, I close the session and have to try again until the others can hear me. 

Before today, I was never asked to allow Electron to access my microphone. I checked the privacy settings and they now say that Electron is allowed to access the builtin microphone. I don't know if this setting was on before, but I have no microphone issues with any other app.

Hope someone can fix this because I really need this feature to be stable and dead simple for my students to use.

The extension was built to solve context switching: I saw myself and many other developers constantly switch between their editor (usually VS Code) and team chat (usually Slack) – because building software is a team sport, and talking to your team about code is a natural part of writing/reviewing code. While it ""made sense"", bringing Slack to the editor sounded like a weird idea (it still kinda does). Incidentally, the webview API had just become stable, and it became possible to ship something like this. I rationalized the weirdness – if it wasn't weird someone else would have done it already – and convinced myself it was worth a shot.

The last year was full of milestones. Soon after the first release, we saw [feature requests](https://github.com/vsls-contrib/chat/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Achat-provider) to support new chat services, and that became a reason to modularize how the extension was built. It made sense to broaden applicability and go beyond Slack, since the goal was always to bring your team closer to code, wherever they may be.

Just as I was thinking of adding support for more chat services, the Slack legal team reached out flagging a trademark violation. ""Slack Chat for VS Code"" sounded too close to being a product from Slack, and I had to rename it. With support for Discord as the second chat service, the extension became ""Team Chat"".

Along the way, the extension found an early fit with the Live Share user community, where users were looking for an [integrated chat](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/live-share/issues/69). The impact of being added to the [Live Share extension pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare-pack) cannot be understated, and that is the main reason why the extension has ~150k unique installs today.

With the [Live Share extensibility API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/liveshare/reference/extensions), it became possible to run chat for Live Share users without depending on Slack/other chat services, and Live Share became the third chat provider. Today, chat on Live Share is about ~10x bigger than Slack (next most popular), and the fit seems to be only getting stronger.

To emphasize this fit, and optimize growth with Live Share, ""Team Chat"" will become ""Live Share Chat"". Support for other chat providers will continue, but the onboarding and documentation will reflect the focus to Live Share.

In the near term, this means:

- [x] Move extension to vsls-contrib org
- [x] Update package.json for marketplace listing
- [x] Update readme

Longer term, this means the extension can focus on Live Share as the first provider, and the code can reflect that focus. So far, a lot of the code is built to manage _n_ chat providers, and going forward I would like to emphasize Live Share as the first provider, so that Live Share reliability is not compromised.",NA,FALSE,https://api.github.com/repos/arjunattam/vscode-chat,https://api.github.com/repos/arjunattam/vscode-chat/issues/418/labels{/name},https://api.github.com/repos/arjunattam/vscode-chat/issues/418/comments,https://api.github.com/repos/arjunattam/vscode-chat/issues/418/events,https://github.com/arjunattam/vscode-chat/issues/418,NA

Showing whether people are active on slack is great, but we use the normal slack app and rely on its presence-detection, so if this app is trying to update our status for us (irrespective of the presence Slack is already tracking in its own app), that eliminates this as an option for us.

In Discord you can begin to @ someone and view an autocomplete field that helps you pick a user with their discriminator (#xxxx). As of right now, if I @ someone's username, they will not receive the mention as the real Discord client must format it in a certain way for it to be recognized as a mention. I would like to suggest adding this functionality.

In addition you can Cmd+V into the chat bar to paste an image or file. I would like to have that in vscode-chat as well.

Even my already muted channels in Discord show up in the extension. I'm in a Discord server where out of about 34 channels, only 5 are relevant to development. I'd like to be able to mute all the other channels.

I'd also like it to not use my Discord settings to do this, as I participate in more than those 5 channels, I just don't want to be distracted by them while doing development. Although, if it used those settings and allowed you to mute more channels that would also be fine.

Edit: I see muted channels referenced in the code. Perhaps I have simply missed how to do so.

Edit 2: I don't see any way to search the Discord docs either, but I don't actually see anywhere in there where you can get a user's muted channels, and the code looks like it is pulling channel categories and checking if they are muted rather than channels themselves.

Here is the output from adding `console.log(channelId + "" "" + name + "" "" + muted);` to `src/discord/index.ts`'s `fetchChannels` `forEach(channel)` loop.

However, this implementation requires usability improvements.

### Initialization

- current state: host needs to start the chat first, to initialize the underlying shared service. guests can join after.
- automatically start the chat service in the background once the live share session has been started, without explicit host action

### Onboarding experience

- current onboarding popup is annoying for users of this chat backend
- how can we use the onboarding tree view for this chat provider?

### Discoverability

- can we use the vs live share activity bar: click action on ""participants"" to start a chat? (right-) click on a user to start a DM?
- unread notifications: use status bar item to show unread message count

### Other

- users joining/leaving the live share session can be message notifications in the chat window. for example, ""xyz has joined""

Let’s get started with automated dependency management for vscode-chat :muscle:

⚠️ Greenkeeper has found a `yarn.lock` file in this repository. Please use [greenkeeper-lockfile](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper-lockfile) to make sure this gets updated as well.

This pull request **updates all your dependencies to their latest version**. Having them all up to date really is the best starting point for keeping up with new releases. Greenkeeper will look out for further dependency updates and make sure to handle them in isolation and in real-time, but only after **you merge this pull request**.

**Important: Greenkeeper will only start watching this repository’s dependency updates after you merge this initial pull request**.

<summary>🏷 How to check the status of this repository</summary>

Greenkeeper adds a badge to your README which indicates the status of this repository.

This is what your badge looks like right now :point_right:  ![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/karigari/vscode-chat.svg)

<summary>🙈 How to ignore certain dependencies</summary>

You may have good reasons for not wanting to update to a certain dependency right now. In this case, you can [change the dependency’s version string in the `package.json` file back to whatever you prefer](https://github.com/karigari/vscode-chat/edit/greenkeeper/initial/package.json).

To make sure Greenkeeper doesn’t nag you again on the next update, add a `greenkeeper.ignore` field to your `package.json`, containing a list of dependencies you don’t want to update.

```js
// package.json
{
  …
  ""greenkeeper"": {
    ""ignore"": [
      ""package-names"",
      ""you-want-me-to-ignore""
    ]
  }
}
```

<summary>👩‍💻 How to update this pull request</summary>

```bash
  # Change into your repository’s directory
  git fetch
  git checkout greenkeeper/initial
  npm install-test
  # Adapt your code until everything works again
  git commit -m 'chore: adapt code to updated dependencies'
  git push origin greenkeeper/initial
```
</details>
<details>
<summary>✨ How do dependency updates work with Greenkeeper?</summary>

After you merge this pull request, **Greenkeeper will create a new branch whenever a  dependency is updated**, with the new version applied. The branch creation should trigger your testing services and check whether your code still works with the new dependency version. Depending on the the results of these tests Greenkeeper will try to open meaningful and helpful pull requests and issues, so your dependencies remain working and up-to-date.

```diff
-  ""underscore"": ""^1.6.0""
+  ""underscore"": ""^1.7.0""
```

The above example shows an in-range update. `1.7.0` is included in the old `^1.6.0` range, because of the [caret `^` character ](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/semver#ranges).
When the test services report success Greenkeeper will silently delete the branch again, because no action needs to be taken – everything is fine.

However, should the tests fail, Greenkeeper will create an issue to inform you about the problem immediately.

This way, you’ll never be surprised by a dependency breaking your code. As long as everything still works, Greenkeeper will stay out of your way, and as soon as something goes wrong, you’ll be the first to know.

```diff
-  ""lodash"": ""^3.0.0""
+  ""lodash"": ""^4.0.0""
```

In this example, the new version `4.0.0` is _not_ included in the old `^3.0.0` range.
For version updates like these – let’s call them “out of range” updates – you’ll receive a pull request.

This means that **you no longer need to check for new versions manually** – Greenkeeper will keep you up to date automatically.

These pull requests not only serve as reminders to update: If you have solid tests and good coverage, and the pull requests passes those tests, you can very likely just merge it and release a new version of your software straight away :shipit:

To get a better idea of which ranges apply to which releases, check out the extremely useful [semver calculator](https://semver.npmjs.com/) provided by npm.

I have 8000 entries matching the index I am looking for and this query gives them all:

`
    const collection = await this.idbService.getAllByIndex(store, 'division', IDBKeyRange.only(division)).toPromise();
    console.log(collection);
`

I thought I could iterate over a cursor to hopefully get through the data and leave before iterating over all when I have the search result.

This is how I attempted to make it work
`
      const cursorSub = this.idbService.openCursorByIndex(store, 'division', IDBKeyRange.only(division)).subscribe((evt) => {
        console.log(evt);

        if (evt.target) {
          const cursor = (evt.target as IDBOpenDBRequest).result as any;
          if (cursor) {
            console.log(cursor.value);
           // TODO Match the filter before adding to search result
            searchResult.result.push(cursor.value);
            cursor.continue();
          } else {
            const endIndex = new Date().getTime();
            console.log(`Done fetching data in indexeddb. [${endIndex - start}ms]`, store);
            cursorSub.unsubscribe();
            resolve(searchResult);
          }
        } else {
          const endIndex = new Date().getTime();
          console.log(`Done fetching data in indexeddb. [${endIndex - start}ms]`, store);
          cursorSub.unsubscribe();
          resolve(searchResult);
        }
      });
`

But, I guess I don't understand how it should work, but I get only one event and never get called again?
I added the if(evt.target) to see if maybe the event was different on a second call, but it's just never called a 2nd time.

It would be nice to have more specialized functions to return the item that I just updated.  This would be beneficial when changing a single entry on a large form, running the update, and getting back the entire latest item that was successfully updated, and using that to update my DOM accordingly.

Likewise, when deleting an item.  Instead of deleting an item and having the entire store come back, I just want to know if it was successful or not and respond in the DOM accordingly.

In the same vein, when I add a brand-new item, instead of getting the key back (which I then must go look up separately), return the item that was added so that I can use it my app accordingly.

this.dbService.addItem('people', { name: 'name', email: 'email' }).then(

Currently there wasn't a clear way to query the database for multiple records without pulling in all the data for those records into memory (see #225 )

Therefore, have added a new variant of `getAllByIndex` named `getAllKeysByIndex` which uses `openKeyCursor` to return the primary keys of a query rather than `openCursor` which returns the full content.

- The implementation returns a Promise first which is then converted to an Observable, so only one item can ever be returned
- `cursor.continue()` is not called in the `request.onsuccess` callback, and calling `continue()` on the returned cursor outside of the function doesn't work as by this point the promise has returned and the database transaction ended

As far as I understand, the current implementation can only ever return the first entry of a query rather than a functional cursor. See the difference between `openCursor()`/`openCursorByIndex()`:
```
request.onsuccess = (event: Event) => {
    resolve(event);
};
```
and `getAllByIndex()` which correctly returns multiple items:
```
request.onsuccess = (event) => {
    const cursor: IDBCursorWithValue = (event.target as IDBRequest<IDBCursorWithValue>).result;
    if (cursor) {
        data.push(cursor.value);
        cursor.continue();
    } else {
        resolve(data);
    }
};
```

In order to get this to work properly, it seems that it's likely that rather than returning a promise, it would be necessary to create an rxjs `Subject` in the function, and emit for each entry? Though not sure how to limit the concurrency of the observable such that the call to `continue()` is only triggered on request, otherwise would attempt to issue a PR.

This can be corrected by  adding a string array data type to the keypath in [ngx-indexed-db.meta.ts](https://github.com/assuncaocharles/ngx-indexed-db/blob/master/projects/ngx-indexed-db/src/lib/ngx-indexed-db.meta.ts#L18).  I for example need to query by both latitude and longitude to get results within a specific box-area.

**Existing Interface**
```typescript
export interface ObjectStoreSchema {
    name: string;
    keypath: string; //<<String only
    options: {
        unique: boolean;
        [key: string]: any;
    };
}
```
**Suggested Interface**
```typescript
export interface ObjectStoreSchema {
    name: string;
    keypath: string | string[]; //<<String or array of strings
    options: {
        unique: boolean;
        [key: string]: any;
    };
}
```

In so doing, you can now define a multi-path indexes in the app module.  See the ""location"" below keypath for example:
```typescript
{
    name: 'geolocation-data',
    version: 1,
    objectStoresMeta: [{
            store: 'globeObjecst',
            storeConfig: { keyPath: 'id', autoIncrement: false },
            storeSchema: [
                { name: 'id', keypath: 'id', options: { unique: true } },
                { name: 'location', keypath: ['location.latitude', 'location.longitude'], options: { unique: false } }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

Then the data can be queried with multiple constraints making it faster and easier for something like geolocation:
```typescript
this.dbService.getAllByIndex('globeObjecst', 'location', IDBKeyRange.bound([latMin, lngMin], [latMax, lngMax])).subscribe((globeObjects) => {
  console.log('All: ', globeObjects);
});
```

I need to save the date of each day in the keypath.
I have for example 1.000.000 records and each one has its date and time. I group them by date and that array that I have of a date I need to keep it in a row of the indexed db. I have managed to insert the array but with autoincrement = true. But I need it to be false and in the keypath I need to put the date.

Another way I have tried has been to record by record, but it is very slow to enter 1.000.000 records one by one.

There is no possibility to open a transaction and enter the 1.000.000 rows and then close the transaction?

* Import of `NgxIndexedDBModule` without errors running the universal express server
* Small refactoring of `CreateObjectStore` and `openDatabase`.

The problem basically was, that the node server, which serves the Angular Application, tried to access the `window.indexedDB`, which is obviously only available in the browser. So the `NgxIndexedDBService` basically only loads the indexedDB, when we use it in a browser.

When I call NgxIndexedDBService.openCusor with no keyRange in IE11, DataError occur.

```javascript
NgxIndexedDBService.openCusor('store name', (event) => {});
```

This code executed successfully in Chrome. But error occured in IE11.

And I found below code that NgxIndexedDBService.openCursor() function pass keyRange argument to IDBObjectStore.openCursor() function.

```typescript
// ngx-indexed-db.service.ts:169
request = objectStore.openCursor(keyRange);
```

I think it seems IDBObjectStore.openCursor() function checks that argument was passed or not.

So if I call IDBObjectStore.openCursor() with explicit undefined argument in IE11, It throws DataError.

It can be reproducted by executing below code in IE11.

```javascript
var request = indexedDB.open('TestDB', 1);
request.onupgradeneeded = function(event) { 
  var db = request.result;
  var store = db.createObjectStore('TestStore', { keyPath: 'id' });
  var index = store.createIndex('indexName', 'name');
  store.put({});
};
request.onsuccess = function(event) {
  var db = request.result;
  var transaction = db.transaction(['TestStore'], ""readonly"");
  var objectStore = transaction.objectStore('TestStore');
  var cursor = objectStore.openCursor(undefined); // SCRIPT5022: DataError
//var cursor = objectStore.openCursor(); // It is OK
//var cursor = objectStore.openCursor(null); // It is OK, too.
};
```

In the README.md file the first code sample has the following:

```
import { NgxIndexedDBModule } from 'ngx-indexed-db';

const dbConfig: DBConfig  = {

This produces the following error:

```
ERROR in src/app/app.module.ts:13:17 - error TS2304: Cannot find name 'DBConfig'.
```

# Repro
1. Start a new Angular project.
2. Add the ng-indexed-db module.
2. Modify the Angular project with the first code sample from this project's README.md

# Expected
That I get no compile-time warnings.

# Actual
I get a compile time warning that it can't find 'DBConfig'.

# Proposed Solution
I'm not very familiar with TypeScript or Angular, so takes this with a grain of salt, but when I added an import for DBConfig then the problem went away:

```
import { NgxIndexedDBModule } from 'ngx-indexed-db';
import { DBConfig } from 'ngx-indexed-db';

const dbConfig: DBConfig  = {

    this.ngxDatabase.currentStore = ""users"";
    this.ngxDatabase.getAll()
      .then(users => {
        // do something with users
      });

    this.ngxDatabase.currentStore = ""animals"";
    this.ngxDatabase.getAll()
      .then(animals => {
        // do something with animals
      });

This creates a race condition because the call to users will return the animals if the `currentStore` is updated before the first operation completes.

I think there is a fundamental issue with having the shared mutable `currentStore` field, as it can be mutated while an operation is still in process.
I think a good (potentially breaking) change would be to pass the ""store"" to each and every operation as a parameter (rather than storing it as a shared mutable field on the `NgxIndexedDBService`):

    this.ngxDatabase.getAll(""users"")
      .then(users => {
        // do something with users
      });
    
    this.ngxDatabase.getAll(""animals"")
      .then(animals => {
        // do something with animals
      });

That way the ""store"" will be scoped to that operation, and operations won't clobber each other by updating that shared mutable field.

As a workaround for now I am saving the ""current operation"" promise as a field in my ""data"" service and am chaining each subsequent operation to it so they are executed sequentially (avoiding the clobbering of the `currentStore`):

    private currentOperation: Promise<any> = Promise.resolve();

    public example() {
      this.execute(""users"", () => {
        return this.ngxDatabase.getAll();
      }).then(users => {
        // do stuff with users
      });

      this.execute(""animals"", () => {
        return this.ngxDatabase.getAll();
      }).then(users => {
        // do stuff with animals
      });

    private execute<T>(store: string, callback: () => Promise<T>): Promise<T> {
      return this.currentOperation = this.currentOperation.then(_ => {
        this.ngxDatabase.currentStore = store;
        return callback();
      })
    }
   }

If you are happy with my suggestion I can create a PR with the breaking change, and a new version could be created.
Or we could come up with an additive API that just adds new methods that take in the ""store"" parameter using the new logic, while leaving the old logic alone for backwards compatibility.

The down side to this is that it bypasses the abstraction for the migration handlers. I debated if I wanted to attempt to abstract this in any way, but decided it was best to allow the underlying objects to be exposed for greater migration flexibility.

I am not sure if this is inline with what you had in mind, so feel free to reject this, but the latest version was unusable for me without the ability to apply migrations between versions.

I try to use this plugin in my Angular 8 project.
I registered the Module as expected in Readme.

```

I followed the readme made available at [https://www.npmjs.com/package/ngx-indexed-db](url) and created an angular8 project that attempts to inject the NgxIndexedDBModule the way the readme suggests. I'm attaching two screenshots, one consisting of the readme I followed, and the other consisting of code that is raising errors, within app.module.ts. 

My Error:

`ERROR in Error during template compile of 'AppModule'
  Function calls are not supported in decorators but 'NgxIndexedDBModule' was called.
Unexpected value 'undefined' imported by the module 'AppModule in C:/Users/REDACTED/REDACTED/REDACTED/REDACTED/REDACTED/src/app/app.module.ts'
Error during template compile of 'AppModule'
  Function calls are not supported in decorators but 'NgxIndexedDBModule' was called.`

Look for a ""THIS CAUSES THE ERROR"" clause within the next section called ""My app.module.ts"".

My app.module.ts:
(you can visit [https://pastebin.com/KFgymh7f](url) if it is not very readable in this post)

//--------------------
`import { DBConfig } from 'ngx-indexed-db';
import { NgxIndexedDBModule } from 'ngx-indexed-db';
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';

const dbConfig: DBConfig = {name: 'MyDb', version: 1, objectStoresMeta: [
{
store: 'people',
storeConfig: { keyPath: 'id', autoIncrement: true },
storeSchema: [
{ name: 'name', keypath: 'name', options: { unique: false } },
{ name: 'email', keypath: 'email', options: { unique: false } }
]
}
]};

@NgModule({
declarations: [],
imports: [
NgxIndexedDBModule.forRoot(dbConfig), //THIS CAUSES THE ERROR
],
providers: [],
})
export class AppModule {}`
//------------------


The sole instantiation of a NgxIndexedDBService itself is not even relevant - the application does not reach the point of attempting to instantiate an app.component.ts.

The version **0.8.0** is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

If you don’t accept this pull request, your project will work just like it did before. However, you might be missing out on a bunch of new features, fixes and/or performance improvements from the dependency update.

It might be worth looking into these changes and trying to get this project onto the latest version of @angular-devkit/build-ng-packagr.

If you have a solid test suite and good coverage, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes directly by merging the proposed change into your project. If the build fails or you don’t have such unconditional trust in your tests, this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

<h2>2.4.0</h2>
<p>Related blog post: <a href=""https://socket.io/blog/socket-io-2-4-0/"">https://socket.io/blog/socket-io-2-4-0/</a></p>
<h3>Features (from Engine.IO)</h3>
<ul>
<li>add support for all cookie options (<a href=""https://github.com/socketio/engine.io/commit/19cc58264a06dca47ed401fbaca32dcdb80a903b"">19cc582</a>)</li>

</ul>
<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>security:</strong> do not allow all origins by default (<a href=""https://github.com/socketio/socket.io/commit/f78a575f66ab693c3ea96ea88429ddb1a44c86c7"">f78a575</a>)</li>
<li>properly overwrite the query sent in the handshake (<a href=""https://github.com/socketio/socket.io/commit/d33a619905a4905c153d4fec337c74da5b533a9e"">d33a619</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>:warning: <strong>BREAKING CHANGE</strong> :warning:</p>
<p>Previously, CORS was enabled by default, which meant that a Socket.IO server sent the necessary CORS headers (<code>Access-Control-Allow-xxx</code>) to <strong>any</strong> domain. This will not be the case anymore, and you now have to explicitly enable it.</p>
<p>Please note that you are not impacted if:</p>
<ul>
<li>you are using Socket.IO v2 and the <code>origins</code> option to restrict the list of allowed domains</li>
<li>you are using Socket.IO v3 (disabled by default)</li>
</ul>
<p>This commit also removes the support for '*' matchers and protocol-less URL:</p>
<pre><code>io.origins('https://example.com:443'); =&gt; io.origins(['https://example.com']);
io.origins('localhost:3000');          =&gt; io.origins(['http://localhost:3000']);
io.origins('http://localhost:*');      =&gt; io.origins(['http://localhost:3000']);
io.origins('*:3000');                  =&gt; io.origins(['http://localhost:3000']);
</code></pre>
<p>To restore the previous behavior (please use with caution):</p>
<pre lang=""js""><code>io.origins((_, callback) =&gt; {
  callback(null, true);
});
</code></pre>

We could allow the server to generate a url that allows remote control from the client in terms of what song is being played on the client that generated the url (and on the client that opens the url, he can see a mirror of the client that plays music in terms of what music is being played and the songs in the library). 

The generated url could just be used to establish a webrtc connection between the player client and the controller clients.

In terms of changes to current functionality:
- We would have to change the player.js::saveState to inform the server of the playstate, which we would share with all the connected controller clients. (The server would have to allow to broadcast the player library information and on player.js::saveState it could periodically also broadcast that state, this way the client's could just see copies of the state of the server).
- We would have to make everything that depends on gettings saving to localstorage on the controller clients to just nop.

Firstly, I want to try creating it with no storage of song files. This is very counter-intuitive to the way Stretto has performed so far. Instead, all songs can simply be played from the [youtube](https://developers.google.com/youtube/js_api_reference) or [soundcloud](https://developers.soundcloud.com/docs/api/html5-widget) embedded players directly (like how we currently perform youtube search / instant mixes).

Down the track I might add a backend that supports linking into so you can store your own song files, or even cross-integrate it with a file-storage service so you can use that as the backing, but that's an extension feature.

The upside to this method however, is massively reduced barrier to entry. I want to be able to host Stretto as a public website and allow people to use the player without having to sign in. This can be done through local storage storing the track / playlist data. The extension of this is to allow users to perform social sign in (my preference) or manual account creation to sync their 'library' between machines.

There are several other tasks that need to happen for this player to be successful:

- [x] General track importing, so you can give it a list of tracks and it can find them on youtube/soundcloud. This would work best with integrations, first of all for Stretto's current library files, then I would also like to do Spotify as they have a [user playlist api](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/get-list-users-playlists/).
- [ ] The appearance of not a completely empty library on first load. I think this could be done with a 'splash screen' of top music charts from the like of [itunes RSS feeds](https://rss.itunes.apple.com/us/?urlDesc=%2Fgenerator) and such.

Other nice to haves that won't be in the initial version / MVP:

- [x] Offline support, that will take some more thinking, and normally the usecase for offline is mobile so may be considered separately
- [x] Mobile application, a mobile counterpart allowing the social sign in and then streaming and or downloading of tracks. How the 'downloading' part would work here, is that the server would have an endpoint like `/youtube/<youtube_id>` and in the background it would stream the file from youtube, convert it to mp3 and stream that out over HTTP. Similar story with soundcloud except we can provide direct mp3 urls for soundcloud.

I figure since this is vastly different to how Stretto is currently, I will rewrite this from the ground up, so I do expect development of this to take a significant period of time (largely dependent on how free I am / how hectic my new job is in January). But I believe this change will reinvent Stretto and bring it to a much larger audience.",NA,FALSE,https://api.github.com/repos/benkaiser/stretto,https://api.github.com/repos/benkaiser/stretto/issues/130/labels{/name},https://api.github.com/repos/benkaiser/stretto/issues/130/comments,https://api.github.com/repos/benkaiser/stretto/issues/130/events,https://github.com/benkaiser/stretto/issues/130,NA

First of all, amazing job, congratulations!

Currently we are using your app as kiosks in android tablets, something like a music kiosk, we created a custom theme but for any strange reason the app isn't working well, here are the details.
1. We are usinng HP slate 21 pro running Android Kitkat, last version of chrome, we already made the test with different browsers and android versions... Firefox, Chrome beta, Chrome Dev, default android browser...
2. The browser doesn't load the app (I mean doesn't run the js functions) (most of the times) we need to reload many times in order to make it work.
3. In order to make it work it was necessary to force the desktop version.

Some questions:
1. Could it be an Android version problem?
2. Is it possible to build an Android app using the current stretto code?
3. Have you ever heard about any similar problem?
4. Do you have any guide in order to create custom themes?

From a fresh git clone. 

Other modules missing are; `mout, configstore, archy, semver-utils, stringify-object, semver-utils, graceful-fs, handlebars`.

After install all these modules with `npm i [module]` I'm then greeted with the following Grunt error:

using

``` js
var globalShortcut = require('global-shortcut'); // Module for shortcuts
```

one can register media keys like so:

``` js
globalShortcut.register('MediaNextTrack', function() { console.log('this hijacks all the media keys'); });
globalShortcut.register('MediaPreviousTrack', function() { console.log('this hijacks all the media keys'); });
globalShortcut.register('MediaPlayPause', function() { console.log('this hijacks all the media keys'); });

in the function calls, one could call player events to skip, go back, or play/pause as necessary.

First, thanks for this great project, I just downloaded it and it works great on my system :)

It would be nice to allow deleting file, i forked the project but I can't see where I can do that, any advise ?

Hi,

I've added a module for fetching lyrics from lyrics.wikia.com which is currently logging to the console. I've also added a lyrics box in place of the new playlist button which I have moved infront of the 'playlist' label. Currently it is above the songname and currently has placeholder text in the image. I'm currently running into trouble with socket.io and am unable to send back the lyrics so as to update them there. 

Obviously this needs work but hopefully, if I could be guided on how to integrate this it would prove to be a cool feature.

The idea is that different product categories have different VAT rates depending on where the goods are and where they need to be shipped.

This feature will allow the BO user to define a ""table"" like:

... | Region 1 | Region 2 | ... | Region N
-- | -- | -- | -- | --
Category 1 | value 1,1 | value 1,2 | ... | value 1,N
Category 2 | value 2,1 | value 2,2 | ... | value 2,N
... | ... | ... | ... | ...
Category M | value M,1 | value M,2 | ... | value M,N

Then, in each product there would be a Part or Field (I am thinking Part) to select the category. 

The regions up there are the first level territories of a specific hierarchy (selected in a feature setting). At the time of computing taxes, those regions are compared with the territory selected for shipping to find the correct rate to be applied for the product.
The setting would also need a ""default"" region, that allows showing prices with applied VAT on frontend (this is a requirement in the EU).

The simplest case for VAT in the EU is an ecommerce selling a single product category, with a small sales volume (there is a specific limit to this, depending on the country of origin of the goods). The table there would be:

... | EU | Not EU
-- | -- | --
Category | Rate | 0.0

I have been playing around some more and I was thinking about overhauling some stuff. Specifically, the way Countries and such are managed. (this applies both to taxation and shipping)

Currently, countries are just strings and that is a mess for localization.

I was thinking of having Territory objects representing this concept in a more fine grained way, and with ContentItems so that I can translate them while keeping the same concepts.

There would need to be a way to relate Territory objects in a many-to-many fashion as a sort of parent-child relationship:

e.g. Territory EU Contains 28 Territories (each one being a country). Territory UK is contained in EU (at least for a while longer) but at the same time is also a part of Territory Commonwealth, together with Canada and a bunch of other countries.

These territories would need flags to mark whether they are ""valid"" for shipping (for shipping purposes, Continental Italy is generally considered separate from Sicily and Sardinia) and whether they are a tax ""unit"" (same taxes, e.g. VAT, apply across all of Italy, including SIcily and Sardinia). THey may also need further flags, to specify whether they represent a Country, a State, a Province, a City.

THe current idea is:
I would have a specific controller to handle defining territories and their relations. 
I would have a ContentType Territory (not listable, not creatable and so on, so it can only be handled form the TerritoryAdminController) representing the territories.
I would have a TerritoryPart, with a string for the name of the territory.
I would have a record TerritoryInternal that is not a ContentPartRecord and that is ""unique"" across localizations of a same Territory: the TerritoryPart of ""United States"" would be related to the same TerritoryInternal as the TerritoryPart of ""Stati Uniti"". Each TerritoryPart would have a reference to a TerritoryInternal record. 
I would also have arelationship table to maintain the n-to-n relationships between territories, that would have foreign keys to the TerritoryInternal table.

For Import/Export of the TerritoryInternal records they would probably need a string that identifies them uniquely.

Once that is in place, we can upgrade shipping and taxes to use those rather than work on strings, so that there is no need to micromanage the fact that I picked to get stuff shipped to ""Italia"" rather than ""Italy"" by creating duplicate shipping methods.",NA,FALSE,https://api.github.com/repos/bleroy/Nwazet.Commerce,https://api.github.com/repos/bleroy/Nwazet.Commerce/issues/134/labels{/name},https://api.github.com/repos/bleroy/Nwazet.Commerce/issues/134/comments,https://api.github.com/repos/bleroy/Nwazet.Commerce/issues/134/events,https://github.com/bleroy/Nwazet.Commerce/issues/134,NA

This PR contains the first portion of the work related to persistent carts and wishlists.

There is no wishlist functionality yet.

the ShoppingCart is treated as a content type with a ProductsListPart to store an authenticated user's cart in the item's infoset.

If a user already has a cart, we do not create a new one.

If a user is not logged in, their cart is stored as it was, using local storage and session storage.Once the user logs in, whatever they had in their carts gets merged into the persistent cart, and session and local storage are kept empty as long as the user is logged in.

The PR as is now does not have the complete feature, but what's there works and can be reviewed.

I refactored the `BundleService`, Moving the interface declaration to its own file, and creating an abstract class with the default implementations, so there si no need to reimplement everything in other IBundleService implementations.

I changed a thing in the abstract implementation of `BuildEditorViewModel`, adding the Where clause. In the default `BundleService` that is always true, but I override it in the `IBundleService` from the feature to conditionally filter out some products from being shown in the UI.

I also added the culture notation ""(culture)"" to the display text of the `ProductEntry` objects, because it's there already, instead of through an alternate. 

There is an additional BundlePart driver, that currently does nothing, but that I created there for later use (I was planning to use it already, and I still might as I finish implementing the whole feature.)",NA,TRUE,https://api.github.com/repos/bleroy/Nwazet.Commerce,https://api.github.com/repos/bleroy/Nwazet.Commerce/issues/118/labels{/name},https://api.github.com/repos/bleroy/Nwazet.Commerce/issues/118/comments,https://api.github.com/repos/bleroy/Nwazet.Commerce/issues/118/events,https://github.com/bleroy/Nwazet.Commerce/pull/118,https://api.github.com/repos/bleroy/Nwazet.Commerce/pulls/118

That means it's 100% lost when the server gets updated and such. Also, I am not 100% sure how that would behave with clients that are not web-browsers (I am thinking specifically about native mobile apps).

I think it would make sense for many (most?) stores to be able to save the cart and keep it related to the user. 

Some considerations that would go into designing this:

- An anonymous user may add items to cart, then login/sign up. The cart should carry over. If the persisted cart was empty, I see few issues. If it was not, then we need to handle things. I would add the new things to the cart, but I see value also in overwriting whatever was in the cart before. I would probably add a setting flag allowing store manager to decide the behaviour.
 -A user may save their cart now. Then come back to the store six months later. We should handle items that are not in the catalog anymore, or whose price have changed. I think we should be consolidating the cart. What I am thinking right now is along the lines of: ""re-validate"" the cart in the records whenever there is a new sessions (check that the session's cart is null), and on certain events (e.g. checkout). Regarding the price, I would not store it in the cart's records. I would only keep the items, the owner.

I found quite a bit of work I am planning to do:

**Currency used / displayed**
It looks like the store uses the server's culture for things it probably shouldn't. On great example of this is the currency the prices are displayed in.
The machine I am doing test on is, of course, in it-IT culture, so the currency symbols and such all default to €. However, I can set up Stripe so that payments are in USD (or any other currency for that matter). I feel this could be a massive functional problem.
I am plannig to fix this by introducing a site setting for the store to set the currency, and then use that everywhere: in writing out prices, in setting up Stripe, anywhere else the currency is involved/relevant.

**Search**
I refer here to a search feature included in the product list. Something to filter products by Culture, SKU, price range, isdigital... or any combination of the properties of a ProductPart. This will come useful when there are a lot of products.

Some digital products may have a limited availability (e.g. tickets to a theatre). Some may be available in unlimited quantities (e.g. winrar licenses).

As things are, the way this could be handled is by setting the inventory of products in the second category  to a very large number, and/or allowing back-order. Since merging in #93, that would leave a label in cart views telling that the product is out of stock, when it really is not.

So I made a few changes, for which I will do a PR momentarily, that allows clearer handling of digital products. Basically, I added a boolean to `ProductPart` called `ConsiderInventory`: when checked for a digital product it causes the product to be treated as belonging in the category of theatre tickets. If left unchecked, the digital product is assumed to be in the winrar license category. The flag does nothing for non-digital products.

Maybe I could add an ""AvailableInventory"" property to the ProductPart. When a customer hits Checkout:
 - The cart is checked against each product's AvailableInventory
 - If the check passes, AvailableInventory is decreased for products in the cart.
 - The change to AvailableInventory for this checkout process is reverted if the chekout fails, is canceled, times out.

All that behaviour is actually quite primitive, in that it only fits a subset of possible cases. I think the concept for inventory has room for improvement in the module. 
- Maybe a product does not an inventory? e.g. when I have an unlimited amount of a product (I sell software, or pizzas)
- Maybe a product needs a more advanced inventory handling, e.g. so that I know I have 4 items being sent, 6 items being made ready in my warehouse, 19 items ""locked"" as they are being purchased, 23 items that can be purchased and sent immediately, 57 items that can be purchased, but will have to be sent later.

1. Can i done this task with this module? 
2. Do you agree we should separate Product Attributes and Specification Attributes? (NopCommerce uses this approach)

In nopCommerce, the product attributes are quantifiable or descriptive aspects of a product (such as, color). For example, if you were to create an attribute for color, with the values of blue, green, yellow, and so on, you may want to apply this attribute to shirts, which you sell in various colors (you can adjust a price or weight for any of existing attribute values). You can then map these attributes to a product variant later on.

Unlike product attributes, specification attributes are used for information purposes only (visible on product details page) and can be used for filtering products on the category details page. They are mapped to products and not to product variants. (Product attributes are mapped to product variants, as described in the section above.) 

Any help would be much appreciated.

I'm trying to install install the module in the newest version of Orchard but I can't get it to work. I'm running it in Visual Studio and when I try to include it in the solution it can't find the references to Orchard.AutoRoute, Orchard.Core, etc.. Probably because it's the wrong version.

Is it possible/what's the best approach to remove shipping entirely? (from checkout and order confirmation etc)
I don't want customers to have to enter anything other than their billing address which is already in their user profiles (custom user item). All the products are digital or services so nothing to ship.

Thanks!

Adding a product to a page layout as a content item or within a projection placed in a page layout throws a HttpAntiForgeryException on save or publish.

My machine keys are fine and all other content types work within layouts (haven't tested forms yet)... So, I'm wondering if this is a bug..?

No logs written and the error message points to machine keys. Multiple antiforgery tokens causing problems?

Thanks!

 I would like to update the products without publish (create new versions of) the products.

Any idea how this could be achieved?

If the **maximum weight** is left empty for a **shipping option**, the _IShippingMethod.ComputePrice_ call fails to give back any _shippingOptions_ within the _ShippingService.GetShippingOptions_ method.

When you enter the attribute list, it shows nothing by default. The dropdown underneath the list is set to ""0"". Changing this makes attributes appear.

I have a user who has placed an Order via PayPal which feeds back to the Nwazet.Commerce.OrderService.CreateOrder method (so it seems it could also happen in Stripe). This individual is from the country of Lithuania and the street address they provided has an invalid character in it (at least as far as my American keyboard and ultimately XML is concerned). As a result, the following error is thrown:

System.ArgumentException: '', hexadecimal value 0x1A, is an invalid character.

This error stems from:

Nwazet.Commerce.Models.OrderPart.PersistCustomer()

though it could stem from any of these methods. So my question is whether there is a single method / override we can apply to escape the invalid characters. 

There is a discussion here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8331119/escape-invalid-xml-characters-in-c-sharp about invalid characters. I am wondering if we can use:

SecurityElement.Escape(text); (from System.Security)

to escape all our incoming text and pull these invalid characters out. Could it be implemented at the ""ToAttr"" method so it is automatically applied against all entries?

Hi

I was hoping if you could please help me with a quick query regarding the functionality of nwazet e-commerce module.

We seem to be having an issue sending emails once an order has been placed and was wondering if this module supported the sending of email confirmations within Orchard or if additional work would be needed.

Any help on this issue would be greatly appreciated.

Many thanks

I have the module in production already, but there are a few changes I'd like to make and I was wondering if you'd be interested in me contributing back those changes:
- product variants: inherits properties from main product but has different inventory.
- JS based shopping cart & checkout: use the shopping cart controller as an API, render stuff client side maybe using AngularJS.
- Bootstrap 3 based views: that can probably be done in a theme in the worst case.

Thanks for that awesome module Betrand.

I am facing an issue with ProductImage not being displayed in Shopping cart view:

```
#!c#

private IEnumerable<dynamic> GetProductShapesFromQuantities(
            IEnumerable<ShoppingCartQuantityProduct> productQuantities) {
            var productShapes = productQuantities.Select(
                productQuantity => _shapeFactory.ShoppingCartItem(
                    Quantity: productQuantity.Quantity,
                    Product: productQuantity.Product,
                    Sku: productQuantity.Product.Sku,
                    Title: _contentManager.GetItemMetadata(productQuantity.Product).DisplayText,
                    ProductAttributes: productQuantity.AttributeIdsToValues,
                    ContentItem: (productQuantity.Product).ContentItem,


                 ProductImage: ((dynamic)productQuantity.Product.ContentItem).Product.ProductImage.MediaParts[0],


                     //((MediaLibraryPickerField) productQuantity.Product.Fields.FirstOrDefault(f => f.Name == ""ProductImage"")),


                    IsDigital: productQuantity.Product.IsDigital,
                    Price: productQuantity.Product.Price,
                    DiscountedPrice: productQuantity.Price,
                    LinePriceAdjustment: productQuantity.LinePriceAdjustment,
                    Promotion: productQuantity.Promotion,
                    ShippingCost: productQuantity.Product.ShippingCost,
                    Weight: productQuantity.Product.Weight,
                    MinimumOrderQuantity: productQuantity.Product.MinimumOrderQuantity)).ToList();                    
            return productShapes;
        }
```

productQuantity.Product.Fields is empty. 
Changed code here to  

```
#!c#

ProductImage: ((dynamic)productQuantity.Product.ContentItem).Product.ProductImage.MediaParts[0],
```

and it worked for me.

Additionaly needed to Change in ShoppingCart.cshtml:

```
#!c#

item.ProductImage.Url 
```

to

```
#!c#

item.ProductImage.MediaUrl 
```

Is this a general issue or just happening here?

Thanks
Dieter

When the Stripe Back button is pressed it throws invalid errors due if you don't have the form filled in. Of course, we don't want client side form validation being done on the Back button being pressed as we are not saving the data anyway. Will try to get a fix but listing this here for anyone else who might run into the issue.

I am migrating a client from an eCommerce site that supports product options where you can have ""multiple purchases"" based on the product option. In other words, if you were selling a ""Cardboard Box"" you could select 5 large and 5 small right on the product screen. As it stands right now I don't believe Nwazet.Commerce supports this and that a user would have to select 5 large (and add to cart) then select 5 small (and add to cart). Am I correct on this? 

The other feature which is kind of nice (though not critical to me today) is that it supports a weight difference based on the option selected. This would allow the shipping to dynamically adjust based on the weight changing due to the options selected. Any thoughts on whether this would be valuable to pursue?

Other than that, the Nwazet.Commerce is right there supporting the other features (better i think :) ) which is fantastic to be able to have this right within Orchard.

When the 'attributes' feature is enabled, upon visiting a 'bundle product' page an ArgumentNullException is logged to the debug log and the add button/form is missing.

When an attribute that was previously associated with a product is deleted, the add button for that product no longer displays. This is caused by an exception thrown from the GetAttributes method in ProductAttributeService.

This is not intuitive and cumbersome for users as they have to go into each product the deleted attribute was associated with and re-save it to resolve the issue.

Steps to repro:
1. Create a new attribute
2. Associate the attribute with a product
3. Delete the attribute created in step 1
4. View the product - the add button is missing

1. It seems that Reports does not support other cultures than en-US. For example in any culture you see en-US month names in charts. Or about currency. In any culture i see currency is $.
2. I think chartjs is not best choice for this module. it uses canvas (instead of svg) and does not support right to left. Even in left to right it has some bugs. 
3. In next release of Orchard (1.x) there are some changes about Date and time localization. For example IDateService has been removed and in Report Controller we must use IDateLocalizationServices. Also about date picker there are some changes.

I have a client that wants to provide free shipping (in the USA) if the value of the order is a certain amount (i.e. if order total is $100). I don't believe there is an existing module for this yet but inquiring to see if anyone knows of one. Thanks for letting me know.

Ran into this issue yesterday with an very large order. When the serialized order contents exceeds 4000 characters, the order fails with the following exception:

```
#!text

2014-10-16 15:46:14,828 [15] NHibernate.AdoNet.AbstractBatcher - Could not execute command: UPDATE Nwazet_Commerce_OrderPartRecord SET Status = @p0, Contents = @p1, Customer = @p2, Activity = @p3, TrackingUrl = @p4, Password = @p5, IsTestOrder = @p6, UserId = @p7, Store = @p8 WHERE Id = @p9
System.InvalidOperationException: @p1 : String truncation: max=4000, len=10144, value='<content subtotal=""936"" total=""936"">.........
```

Although the user receives an error message instead of the order confirmation page, the worst part is that the Stripe transaction is still processed and the New Order event is fired so any order confirmation emails you have setup are sent out.

From the research I've done, it sounds like SQL Compact can handle large ntext values but has issues with validating them on the way in depending on how the sql statement is constructed. The issue is described [here](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/sqlserver/en-US/9fe8e826-7c20-466c-8140-4d3b0649ac09/sql-server-compact-edition-ntext-fails-with-string-over-4000-characters?forum=sqlce).

One obvious solution would be to migrate the database to full SQL Server. I'm wondering if there is anything that can be done for SQL Compact though. I don't have any good ideas at this point. Thoughts?

For certain product attribute options, I need to add a way for end-users to provide an additional custom value that will be carried through into the order details. For example, let's say we sell sports jerseys. We might have a product attribute that allows customers to select whether or not they want to customize the jersey with their own last name on the back. When the customer selects the ""Customize with my name"" option, we need to display a text box where they can enter their last name.

Here's how I'm thinking it might look:

_Product Attribute Admin_

![attr-admin.png](https://bitbucket.org/repo/Aq7xr/images/2196577451-attr-admin.png)

_Product View_

![product.png](https://bitbucket.org/repo/Aq7xr/images/855495416-product.png)

_Shopping Cart_

![cart.png](https://bitbucket.org/repo/Aq7xr/images/3538887790-cart.png)

I've created a rough version of this just to see what it would take and it seems to work pretty well. I simply took the AttributeIdsToValues dictionary that's used in the shopping cart and checkout and updated the dictionary value from a string type to Tuple<string, string> type. I'm thinking when I do it for real, I'll create a simple model so the code is clearer as to the purpose.

I'd be interested in any thoughts you may have. Is there a better way to approach the problem? Are there any pitfalls I may be missing?

Also, is this something you'd consider as a pull request?

Thanks!

I'm working on some changes so we can control both the order in which attribute drop-down lists are rendered on the page and the order of attribute options within the each drop-down. In our case, this is needed because there is a logical order in which the user would want to choose certain attributes and some attribute options have a logical order as well. Think t-shirts where the sizes (small, medium, large, x-large) seem awkward in alpha order (large, medium, small, x-large).

I'm also adding a secondary display text value for attributes so the label of the drop-down shown to the user can be different from the attribute's title. This is useful for us because we may have several attributes that we want to display to the user with the same label, but on the back-end we want to easily identify them as being different. Apparel is good example, we may have a bunch of different products where we want the user to select ""Size"", but on the back-end we want to title the attributes as ""T-Shirt size"", ""Sweater Size"", etc.

Do you think these would be useful additions to the module? Would you consider this as a pull request? I have quite a bit of the work done and so far the changes are fairly simple and isolated.

Nwazet.Commerce.Controllers.StripeController is listed as a ""Stripe"" feature and it utilizes ""IOrderService"" which is currently only resolvable when the ""Nwazet.Orders"" feature is enabled. I don't believe there is a way of removing this dependency though it would be nice. I have an example where I just want a user to ""SendMoney"" without the overhead of Nwazet.Orders. Look forward to your thoughts.

I need to add a checkout option that does not use credit cards. In this particular case, it's payment based on department codes, but I could see other non-credit card payment options being useful in certain cases as well (COD for example).

For the most part, this has been a relatively easy exercise. I've implemented my own ICheckoutService and a custom controller to handle the collection of shipping and payment details. I've been able to do all this in my own module.

The issue I'm running into is that the OrderService (and StripeService) expects to deal with a CreditCardCharge object but my payment information doesn't fit that mold. I've played around with extracting a common interface that could serve additional charge types and it's  working so far. Here's what it looks like:

```
#!c#

public interface ICharge : IDependency {
    string TransactionId { get; set; }
    string ChargeText { get; set; }
    string TransactionUrl { get; set; }
    CheckoutError Error { get; set; }
}
```

The biggest change is that the charge description (ChargeText is what I called it) is generated by the checkout service upfront instead of being dynamically built from the credit card details when an order is retrieved. You lose the ability to access credit card details separately, but as far as I can tell, the only time they were ever used was to construct the charge description anyway.

I'm interested in your thoughts on this approach. Is there a better or alternative way to do it? Also, is this something you would consider as a pull request? I'd really like to keep my implementation as close to the official repo as possible.

The only other option I came up with would be to stuff my payment details into the CreditCardCharge class. This does work, but seems ugly and I'd probably have to hack at the order views so the payment details displayed in a reasonable way to customers.

When I first added this widget on a projection page, I got huge flood of AjaxUpdate (like 20 requests per second and it continued over 500 requests when Firebug stopped tracking it). I tried to move it to disabled layer to verify it's indeed this widget causing it and flooding stopped. Then moved it to different visible layer and flooding started again on that layer. So I added product into a cart to verify if it does only for empty cart and it stopped for good and I can no longer reproduce the issue. 

I'm sorry that I can't give more info, but maybe someone else encountered this or at least has an idea what caused it.

I'm just looking for ideas here, this isn't necessarily an issue with the module. Hopefully that's OK.

I'm trying to create an IScheduledTaskHandler that run periodically and generates some files that need to include the discounted price for particular products. 

The problem I'm running into is that the Applies method in Discount.cs relies on having an accessible HttpContext to instantiate a URLHelper to get the products path, which in normal situations would be the current requested page.

Since I'm doing this in a background service I don't have an HttpContext and the call to Applies throws an exception. Any ideas on how I could possibly work around that? I'd be fine with making some modification to my instance of the module if necessary.

Scenario: I have products that contain a registration URL field. I would like to use a workflow and send out the registration URL on the product for each product that was ordered. 

Dilemma: There doesn't appear to be a way to iterate over the Order IEnumerable<CheckoutItem> items within a Workflow. 

Ideally: I would be able to iterate over products, expand them using something like Order.Items:1.Product.Fields.Foo.Bar to snag a field value send off one (or multiple) emails with further information around the product that was just purchased. Of course this would assume I actually know how many products are in the cart (and is thus not a perfect solution).

I have looked at C# Scripting module and am getting no where that way. Any chance anyone has ever had to do this? Any alternative approaches that work?

My Coupon module utilized the Discount framework. I would like to be able to offer Single Use coupons. The only way to do this is to keep track of the coupon the user utilizes. Unfortunately, I believe the Discount Codes (and thus my coupon codes) are not recorded anywhere with the order. So I have the following thoughts:
1. I could expand the Orders (xml) to record the Discount Code(s) that were used with the order
2. I could build a database table to capture these orders

I don't believe there is any way of doing either of the above without blending back into the native Nwazet.Commerce module (i.e. there are not extension points I can think of that expose this to allow a third party module to handle). So the questions are:
1. Do you know of any touch point where I could collect the discount codes?
2. If not, does it make sense for core Nwazet.Commerce to capture discount codes utilized?
3. Querying old Orders (via XML) won't be fast to query but I hate to throw up an extra table just to track discount codes used with a user, any other possibilities? Do you think XML would slow things down?

The line adjustment property (added as part of attribute pricing pull request) should be exposed as part of the Order.Items token so it can be included in order confirmation emails and such.

An admin should be able to do something like this:

```

{Order.Items.Format: $quantity x $product + $lineadjustment}

When saving general site settings, the Pricing settings used by the Tiered Pricing feature are being incorrectly overridden.

Steps to repro:
1. Enable the Tiered Pricing feature.
2. Go to the Pricing settings page and update the settings.
3. Go to the Settings page and click save.
4. Go back to the Pricing settings page - the updates made in step 2 are lost.

This is happening because the ProductSettingsPartDriver is being called when the general site settings are saved but the call to TryUpdateModel in the driver's Editor method fails to update the ProductSettingsViewModel with the previously saved values.

I can see a few ways to fix this. I could refactor the pricing settings to eliminate the use of the driver but that would be a big change. Another option would be to simply add a test in the driver to check if the update initiated from the Pricing settings page and only update the part in that case. The best way I can think of to do this is check if the updater object is of type ProductSettingsAdminController. Any thoughts or suggestions?

The exact same issue exists in the Orchard.Search core module. I logged a bug for it on codeplex: https://orchard.codeplex.com/workitem/20494

Without CreateOrder firing an event after the information is loaded into it, it makes it impossible to use a handler for doing stuff after the data is there. Here is my fix (or I welcome another approach):

```
#!c#
var order = _contentManager.Create(""Order"", VersionOptions.DraftRequired).As<OrderPart>();
order.Build(creditCardCharge, items, subTotal, total, taxes,
    shippingOption, shippingAddress, billingAddress, customerEmail,
    customerPhone, specialInstructions);
order.Status = status;
order.TrackingUrl = trackingUrl;
order.IsTestOrder = isTestOrder;
order.UserId = userId;

var random = new byte[8];
RngCsp.GetBytes(random);
order.Password = Convert.ToBase64String(random);

_contentManager.Publish(order.ContentItem);
```

The only important parts / changes are creating it as a draft:

```
#!c#
var order = _contentManager.Create(""Order"", VersionOptions.DraftRequired).As<OrderPart>();
```

Then publishing it once all the data is added:

```
#!c#
_contentManager.Publish(order.ContentItem);
```

This allows a handler I have to pick up the OnPublished event for a part that is attached to the Order.

In Nwazet.Commerce.Services.OrderService on the CreateOrder method it simply needs this added:

Items in the shopping cart remain after completing the checkout process. I would typically expect the cart to be cleared after checkout. Is this by design?

I'm looking at how to clear the cart on checkout and it appears I'll need to add a method to IShoppingCartStorage to remove them from session state and clear them from localStorage as well. Any suggestions on the best way/place to do this? Are there existing hooks I'm missing?

New to Orchard so sorry in advance, if this is NOT the place to poste my issue.
Here is what I did:

Downloaded Orchard 1.7.2
Open in VS 2012 Ultimate with Update 3 and compiled and execute the code
F5 in VS and setup the new Orchard site using default recipe
Added the Module Nwazet.Commerce and enabled all feature
Nothing Appears on the dashbord menu :-( even if I sign out and sign in

stopped VS debugging
Noticed the Module download was not included in the solution Modules folder so included it
Compilation now gave this error:

The type or namespace name 'MediaPickerField' could not be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?)
D:\Projects\OrchardTest\src\Orchard.Web\Modules\Nwazet.Commerce\Controllers\ShoppingCartController.cs   71  37  Nwazet.Commerce

Can see this bug already listed on this site where you suggest to download the correct version from the branch for the CMS being used.

I therefore downloaded the latest version ( https://bitbucket.org/bleroy/nwazet.commerce/get/0b1de3326ff0.zip) and replaced the modules\Nwazet.Commerce in my VS solution

Now I gets lots of error like this:

'Nwazet.Commerce.Models.StripeSettingsPart' does not contain a definition for 'Retrieve' and no extension method 'Retrieve' accepting a first argument of type 'Nwazet.Commerce.Models.StripeSettingsPart' could be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?) D:\Projects\OrchardTest\src\Orchard.Web\Modules\Nwazet.Commerce\Models\StripeSettingsPart.cs    10  31  Nwazet.Commerce

Obviously as I am new to Orchard I am doing someone wrong, so can someone point me the right direction so I can make this Module compile and work.

With the switch in place, the DiscountPartDriver.cs line 74 updates the part.Record.Discount to whatever you provide via the interface (and the database does properly reflects this). However the DiscountPart.cs Model uses Retrieve to fetch the discount value. This means it will first use Infoset and get the discount value from the Content Item rather than the Record and the Content Item is never updated. This effectively means there is no way to update a Discount.

Here is the code segment I have implemented to fix this. It gets used in DiscountPartDriver.cs Editor method.

Existing Code to replace:

```
#!c#
part.Record.Discount = model.Discount;
```

New Code

```
#!c#
string discountString = model.Discount;
double percent;
double discount;
if (!String.IsNullOrEmpty(discountString)) {
    if (discountString.Trim().EndsWith(""%"")) {
        if (double.TryParse(discountString.Substring(0, discountString.Length - 1), out percent)) {
            part.DiscountPercent = percent;
        }
    }
    else {
        if (double.TryParse(discountString, out discount)) {
            part.Discount = discount;
        }
    }
}
```

In BundleServices.cs the GetProducts() method retrievews the VersionOptions.Latest variation of Products. However, the AddProduct(int quantity, int product, BundlePartRecord record) method simply uses _contentManager.Get(product).Record. Therefore, when the ""product"" is unpublished it will not return any ContentItem will be null and .Record call will throw an error.

I am not sure which way is best to go. Should a user be allowed to add products that are unpublished (seems like to me they should be able to as someone could have delayed publishing in effect to become available on a particular date). If so, we just need to change this line of code:

```
#!c#

ContentItemRecord = _contentManager.Get(product).Record,
```

to

```
#!c#

ContentItemRecord = _contentManager.Get(product, VersionOptions.Latest).Record,
```

to be consistent with the bundle part selection list.  

While we are on the topic, it becomes difficult to manage bundles when the list of products you have becomes long. Any thoughts as to what type of User Interface could better handle this?

Finally, the only other ""Bundle"" issue I see is that SysCache prevents the showing of updated bundle information when you make a change. I have ran into this issue before when working directly with Records and have no idea how to cause SysCache to clear itself and pull from the database again. Just makes it difficult when you know you updated the bundle but don't see any changes...

I have a requirement to adjust product prices based on the attributes the customer selects when adding a product to the cart. Would you be interested in pulling this into the official module if I come up with a nice solution for it?

I have an initial implementation I'm working on and it only required a few adjustments to the ProductAttributePart (to collect and store price adjustments) and a small change to the PriceService to actually adjust the price when necessary. 

Here's what the feature looks like at the moment:

**Attribute selection**

Hi,
I have installed & enabled Nwzet Commerce module onto Orchard 1.7.2.

The Commerce link is not showing in the Admin Panel.

Any help please?

Here is some exceptions I am getting:

I have a requirement to provide different pricing levels based on the quantity of a Product ordered. I can definitely achieve this by setting up a series of Discounts for each Product but it's a clunky solution for the admin when most Products need tier pricing. 

If I developed a more convenient solution to this problem, would that be something you'd be interested in pulling into the module?

Also, do you have any tips on the best way to develop the solution? I'm considering modifying the ProductPart to allow for multiple prices (although this could have a ripple effect into quite a few other areas) or maybe just reusing the Discount functionality and providing a convenient way to automatically create all the necessary Discounts from the Product editor. Haven't dug into it too much yet so I figured I'd see if you had any guidance.

Thanks for this great module and all your contributions to Orchard!

Hi Bertrand,

After recooking orchard I noticed that if there is an item in the localStorage cart (client-side javascript) that does not correspond to a product in the database (by product Id), the shopping cart widget fails to load properly when the javascript tries to load the shopping cart. If the cart it gets from the server is empty (NakedCart action, I believe), it will try to load the cart from localStorage. Here it picks up the offending item. The script onCartLoad will then post this to the AjaxUpdate action and pass it the offending item. AjaxUpdate will return a server error, and the cart widget fails to load properly. 

You can reproduce this by running the following line in the java script. This will create the phantom item.

```
    localStorage[""nwazet.cart""] = '{ ""Country"": ""United States"", ""ZipCode"": ""02459"", ""items[0].ProductId"": ""6660666"", ""items[0].Quantity"": ""1"" }';


```

After than, any page with the cart widget will get a server failure error from the AjaxUpdate action. The ShoppingCart.GetProducts throws a ""Sequence contains no matching element"" exception with the following call stack:

```
#!c#

nwazet.commerce.dll!Nwazet.Commerce.Models.ShoppingCart.GetProducts() Line 119 + 0x9a bytes C#

nwazet.commerce.dll!Nwazet.Commerce.Controllers.ShoppingCartController.BuildCartShape(bool isSummary = true, string country = ""United States"", string zipCode = ""02459"", Nwazet.Commerce.Models.ShippingOption shippingOption = null) Line 103 + 0x58 bytes C#
    nwazet.commerce.dll!Nwazet.Commerce.Controllers.ShoppingCartController.AjaxUpdate(Nwazet.Commerce.ViewModels.UpdateShoppingCartItemViewModel[] items = {Nwazet.Commerce.ViewModels.UpdateShoppingCartItemViewModel[1]}, string country = ""United States"", string zipCode = ""02459"") Line 206 + 0x26c bytes  C#

```

Hello,
It seems that nwazet.commerce version 1.6 does not work well with Orchard 1.7 - after installing the nwazet.commerce module from gallery(http://gallery.orchardproject.net/List/Modules/Orchard.Module.Nwazet.Commerce) no Commerce tab is shown in admin panel. Is there any plan to update nwazet.commerce in orchard modules gallery so that it works OK with Orchard 1.7?
Or maybe you can expose the updated package to upload it in orchard manually?
Thanks!

Hi Bertrand, Could you place your new order in a dedicated feature for the module?
This could allow an easier upgrade for datwendo.commerce which has also orders, I would do the same in my code.

Thanks

I have products that include the product part in their definition (so I never use the raw Product content type) and in v1.6 it worked fine, but now in Orchard 1.7.1, every time I add an item to the cart I get the following exception:

Specified cast is not valid.

Description: An unhandled exception occurred during the execution of the current web request. Please review the stack trace for more information about the error and where it originated in the code. 

**See attachment**

I have tried running the site from v1.7.1 source in VS and debugged (break on all exceptions) and it never hits the code. Even though the exception looks like it's related to MVC, I can't get it to break into any of the Nwazet Controllers or Drivers before this exception occurs, so I can't see the cause.

As I said, this was working 1.6 just fine for other projects - this is not an upgrade, but a clean 1.7.1 project from scratch.
Any help tracking this down is much appreciated.

Hi,

I install Orchard 1.7 and download module Nwazet.Commerce from bitbucket (on Orchard gallery is version 1.6).
But when i enable module then retrieve error message :

The assembly reference 'Orchard.MediaPicker' could not be loaded for module 'nwazet.commerce'. 

Is module is ready for Orchard 1.7? 
I have heard BertrandLeroy normal installation on his site, i missing something?

If there is an ending space character in any attribute line this method throws because the selected attribute getting trimmed in shopping cart process.
each attribute line should be trimmed for ending spaces

Scenario:
- put a cart widget in a page
- add product to cart
- when cart is empty all is ok

if you click add again
- expected behavior is ""another product is added to cart""
- but instead no product is added, and if you refresh page you see that all product are removed from cart

reproduce live here:
http://jacopo.cms.duemetri.com/product-categories/category-1

Reason:

on first call is called 

Nwazet.Commerce/ShoppingCart/Add/{product}

all is ok

on second call is called 

/Nwazet.Commerce/ShoppingCart/AjaxUpdate

inspecting the ajax call you see that the second product has missing product id

I have narrowed the problem to this row of shopping cart

shoppingcart.js, row 77: productId = addForm.data(""productid""),

it is null....

This was breaking my page with very large pictures where I was previously reducing the image size in this screen.

As noted [here](https://github.com/sh78/hyper-solarized-one#background-), I had trouble finding a Solarized theme that worked for my workflow. So I made one that looks good w/ the official [Solarized vim plugin](https://github.com/altercation/vim-colors-solarized) and also allows setting custom times to switch between light/dark modes.

Vivá Hyper!

The existing implementations of the Solarized theme, hyper-solarized-dark and hyper-solarized-light, were split into two variants, were not fully compatible with the original implementation of Solarized, and did not allow user-customization.

## Why?

The plugin is really good, and slightly popular as well. It would be a great help for the plugin to make it to this list as well. It's a good alternative to transparency plugins and is useful for changing a terminal's background, a feature Hyper doesn't offer (yet). Similar terminals offer such features and I thought it would be great for Hyper to have such a feature. If this plugin makes it to this list, a lot more people will be aware about this plugin's features.",NA,TRUE,https://api.github.com/repos/bnb/awesome-hyper,https://api.github.com/repos/bnb/awesome-hyper/issues/277/labels{/name},https://api.github.com/repos/bnb/awesome-hyper/issues/277/comments,https://api.github.com/repos/bnb/awesome-hyper/issues/277/events,https://github.com/bnb/awesome-hyper/pull/277,https://api.github.com/repos/bnb/awesome-hyper/pulls/277

The Windows taskbar icon for Terminal highlights for a bit, then disappears. When I open up Task Manager, I see the amount of `Hyper.exe` processes grow as I click to start Hyper.

Even after 5-10mins, it never opens up.

Something interesting, though, is that 4 `Hyper.exe` processes start up with just 1 attempt to start Hyper from scratch. I wonder if this has to do with tab startup, as I had unsuccessfully tried to open up a few tabs while it was executing a long task at the start of the day. The restart I had tried above was the first restart I had done since this tab situation.

I feel like either...

- Something went wrong with the *hyper-sync-settings* install
- Or the failed tabs aren't quite alive enough for Hyper to start

These are the logs I get from SquirrelSetup.log...

When I do right now, it seems like the cursor is just totally in the wrong place even when there is no text. I might be doing something incorrectly though. If I use the default font of 

`Menlo, ""DejaVu Sans Mono"", ""Lucida Console"", monospace`

the cursor appears as I would expect. The same with other monospace fonts such as 

`""Courier New"", Courier, monospace`

However If I use a font like

`Papyrus, fantasy`

the cursor then becomes too far to the right by like 10-15 characters while the font does render correctly.

I just published my first HyperTerm plugin: [`hyperterm-maclite`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hyperterm-maclite). I'm calling it a theme because it makes mostly aesthetic changes to tab appearance, including moving tab close buttons to the left. But I just saw the plugin `hyperterm-close-on-left` listed here, which does that same thing in a package by itself. Is my plugin too ambitious in that respect to be called a theme? On the other hand, the plugin doesn't make any changes to fonts or offer much other theming _inside_ the terminal window. Have I miscategorized it?

I'm considering removing my plugin's color overrides and rebranding it as a ""window theme"" (or something to that effect) that would be compatible with other themes listed here. No reason you shouldn't be able to mix-and-match my window styles with other people's color themes. Sorry if this is the wrong place to discuss this, I'm hoping to get some input from other HyperTerm plugin devs.

<h2>2.4.1</h2>
<p>This release reverts the breaking change introduced in <code>2.4.0</code> (<a href=""https://github.com/socketio/socket.io/commit/f78a575f66ab693c3ea96ea88429ddb1a44c86c7"">https://github.com/socketio/socket.io/commit/f78a575f66ab693c3ea96ea88429ddb1a44c86c7</a>).</p>
<p>If you are using Socket.IO v2, you should explicitly allow/disallow cross-origin requests:</p>
<ul>
<li>without CORS (server and client are served from the same domain):</li>
</ul>
<pre lang=""js""><code>io.origins((req, callback) =&gt; {
  callback(null, req.headers.origin === undefined); // cross-origin requests will not be allowed
});
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>with CORS (server and client are served from distinct domains):</li>
</ul>
<pre lang=""js""><code>io.origins([&quot;http://localhost:3000&quot;]); // for local development
io.origins([&quot;https://example.com&quot;]);
</code></pre>
<p>In any case, please consider upgrading to Socket.IO v3, where this security issue is now fixed (CORS is disabled by default).</p>

<li>add support for all cookie options (<a href=""https://github.com/socketio/engine.io/commit/19cc58264a06dca47ed401fbaca32dcdb80a903b"">19cc582</a>)</li>
<li>disable perMessageDeflate by default (<a href=""https://github.com/socketio/engine.io/commit/5ad273601eb66c7b318542f87026837bf9dddd21"">5ad2736</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>security:</strong> do not allow all origins by default (<a href=""https://github.com/socketio/socket.io/commit/f78a575f66ab693c3ea96ea88429ddb1a44c86c7"">f78a575</a>)</li>
<li>properly overwrite the query sent in the handshake (<a href=""https://github.com/socketio/socket.io/commit/d33a619905a4905c153d4fec337c74da5b533a9e"">d33a619</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>:warning: <strong>BREAKING CHANGE</strong> :warning:</p>
<p>Previously, CORS was enabled by default, which meant that a Socket.IO server sent the necessary CORS headers (<code>Access-Control-Allow-xxx</code>) to <strong>any</strong> domain. This will not be the case anymore, and you now have to explicitly enable it.</p>

I'd like to integrate this into CI for my project ([Sucrase](https://github.com/alangpierce/sucrase)) and noticed that under normal CLI usage, it exits 0 even if some tests failed. Normally I'd expect a test runner to exit nonzero if it successfully ran tests and determined that some tests failed, maybe using different exit codes to distinguish between ""failed to run tests"" and ""some tests failed"". Could the test runner be changed to exit nonzero in that case, maybe behind an option?

While using `--prelude`, I consistently see the following error.
```
Expected no error, got SyntaxError: Invalid regular expression: missing /
```

## Suspected Cause
If you log out the test contents, you'll find that it inserts `/[HERE]/ Copyright` rather than `[HERE]// Copyright`. This creates a line starting with `/ Copyright`, which is an unclosed regex. Hence the SyntaxError

## Possible Solution
I was able to work around this by modifying `insertPrelude` (https://github.com/bterlson/test262-harness/blob/master/bin/run.js#L194) to slice up to `index - 1` rather than `index`:

```js
function insertPrelude(test) {
  const index = test.insertionIndex;
  if (index === -1) {
    return test;
  }

  if (preludeContents) {
    test.contents = test.contents.slice(0, index - 1) + // change here
      preludeContents +
      test.contents.slice(index - 1); // change here
  }

  return test;
}
```

## Notes
I suspect this is related to the recent change in test262-stream: https://github.com/bocoup/test262-stream/releases

I am willing to submit a PR, but I don't know if it should be here, or if there is a problem with test262-stream, or if the problem lies elsewhere

directory and ""compile"" valid ECMAScript tests from its file contents in
accordance with its interpretation guidelines.

The `test262-stream` Node.js module has been designed to traverse a
Test262 directory and emit valid ECMAScript test source code according
to its contents. It is currently in use within the test suites of a
number of JavaScript projects including Acorn, Babylon, Esprima, and
JSHint. By incorporating it here, this project can be alleviated of the
burden of maintaining file system code and can benefit from the shared
maintenance efforts of a much larger user base.

This patch is expected to preserve existing behavior. It modifies some tests,
but it does so only to increase their precision. In order to make that more
clear, I've organized the test modifications in a separate commit that precedes
the refactoring.

explicitly versoining Test262. Shortly after that, [I wrote up the rationale in
a pull request](https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/1255), and we've been
observing SemVer (or something like it) in Test262 since then.

This patch delivers the user-facing value of that convention: a safety
mechanism that ensures folks don't accidentally run tests with invalid
configurations. This is a breaking change; the commit message has more detail.

---

This is a breaking change; details are provided below.

Because the instructions for correctly interpreting Test262 tests
occasionally change, `test262-harness` may not be capable of correctly
interpreting the input files.

Previously, `test262-harness` would accept test files without regard for
the corresponding version of Test262. This made it possible for users to
unknowingly use incompatible versions and thereby receive invalid
results.

Not all changes in the interpretation guidelines effect all users. For
instance, a user interested in testing a ""polyfill"" for
`Array.prototype.includes` would not be effected by alterations to
interpretation guidelines for Atomics. Supporting use cases like this
involves allowing users to *intentionally* use incompatible versions of
Test262.

Inspect the version of Test262 under test and ensure that it is within a
known-compatible range. Implement a new option named `--acceptVersion`
to allow users to explicitly opt out of this behavior.

Note on backwards-compatibility:

Previously, arbitrary files could be tested as long as an ""includes""
directory was specified. This change is not backwards-compatible because
it requires one of the following:

- input files are located within a Test262 directory
- a Test262 directory is specified via the `--test262Dir` command-line

- Redesigned the function signature. Since the `test262Dir` is required, it
  should be specified via a formal parameter. All other input is optional and
  best-specified via an `options` object.

On a lower level, I've moved all ""glob"" parsing code to the CLI module. This functionality seems much more relevant in CLI contexts and less likely to be used during programmatic interaction.

This has convinced me that this code really belongs in a standalone module. It doesn't seem appropriate for a consumer like Babylon to download `glob` or `eshost` or `chalk` or `yargs`, even just in ""development"" contexts. To me, the highly customized testing strategy is another indication that these things ought to be decoupled.

So I'm submitting this patch here for feedback, but I would prefer to actually land this in an independent repository, publish to npm as `test262-stream`, and then update `test262-harness` to depend on that.

The automation work necessary to do this is application-agnostic, and the code I've written across those projects is highly duplicative. I considered abstracting it into a standalone library, but this functionality is *also* implemented in this project. If `test262-harness` exposed a Node.js API for visiting the ""compiled"" tests, then:

- The code that other project owners have to maintain in order to consumer Test262 would be greatly simplified (making the prospect of using Test262 more appealing overall)
- Future modifications to Test262's frontmatter format could be made more tolerable

Here's the API I have in mind:

```js
var t262 = require('test262-harness');

var stream = t262.testStream({
    // Supports the following options (as supported by the CLI):
    test262Dir: '', // required
    includesDir: '', // optional
    prelude: ''  // optional
  });

stream.on('data', function(test) {
    // `test` object as provided by https://github.com/smikes/test262-parser,
    // with an additioinal attribute: `scenario`. Today, it work wither have
    // the value 'strict mode' or 'default'. It may take on additional values
    // in future revisions of Tes262.
  });

stream.on('end', function() {
    console.log('Done testing');
  });

stream.on('error', function(err) {
    console.error('Something went wrong:', err);
  });
```

I'm working on running this test harness against https://github.com/NeilFraser/JS-Interpreter, which is what we use for [code.org](https://github.com/code-dot-org/code-dot-org). I've forked eshost and written a [custom agent](https://github.com/pcardune/eshost/commit/81d71740c3a2976903f1c2b43d3dade7f31cf385). I'd like to get the same results without having to fork eshost. I would submit a pull request against eshost, but I don't think this agent really belongs in eshost at all.

A couple options I can think of:
1. add a `--hostsDirectory` option to `test262-harness` which gets passed through to `eshost.createAgent`:

   ```bash
   test262-harness \
     --hostDirectory=./my-hosts/ \
     --hostType=my-interpreter \
     path/to/tests/**/*.js
   ```
2. expose a node interface to `test262-harness/bin/run.js` so I can create my own script which ""registers"" a new agent directly:

   ```js
   const eshost = require('eshost');
   const test262Harness = require('test262-harness');
   const SomeCustomAgent = require('./MyCustomAgent');
   eshost.registerAgent('my-interpreter', SomeCustomAgent);
   test262Harness.run();

Looking at current tc39/test262@master, `ch15/15.2/15.2.3/15.2.3.9/15.2.3.9-2-c-4.js` is a test which I expect should fail when run in strict mode.  A property is configured on an object; the object is then frozen; and then we attempt to delete the property.

As expected, the python runner shows an exception in strict mode:

The compiler first tries to see whether the following function is a valid candidate and evaluating ‘SizedSentinel’:

 

       template<class C, class S>

       requires cursor::SizedSentinel<S, C>

       constexpr cursor::difference_type_t<C> operator-(

              const S& lhs, const basic_iterator<C>& rhs)

       STL2_NOEXCEPT_RETURN(

              get_cursor(rhs).distance_to(lhs)

       )

 

Semiregular then tries to see whether S is copy constructible:

 

              template<class S, class C>

              META_CONCEPT SizedSentinel =

                      Sentinel<S, C> &&

                      requires(const C& c, const S& s) {

                             { c.distance_to(s) } -> Same<difference_type_t<C>>COMPOUND_REQUIREMENT_RREF;

                      };

              template<class S, class C>

              META_CONCEPT Sentinel =

                      Cursor<C> &&

                      Semiregular<S> &&

                      requires(const C& c, const S& s) {

                             { c.equal(s) } -> bool;

                      };

 

Then end up trying this ctor of basic_iterator (inherited from cursor::mixin):

 

template<InputIterator I> explicit mixin(I i)

 

InputIterator circular references back to the iter_difference_t:

 

       template<class I>

       META_CONCEPT WeaklyIncrementable =

              Semiregular<I> &&

              requires(I i) {

                      typename iter_difference_t<I>;

                      requires SignedIntegral<iter_difference_t<I>>;

1. Change all the construction paths to take a Length rather than a Pattern and store the Length in the view . The Length will necessarily be an Integral type. If the length

## Changes

* Return types more closely resemble what's in R2. I created exposition-only base structs instead of creating aliases to see how well that would work with the library as a whole.
* Removed a lot of dependency on `tagged.hpp` in the wake of named return types.
* Most algorithms are now implemented as functors, and are not lookupable by ADL, as required by [specialized.algorithms]/3.1 and [algorithms.requirements]/2.
  * Many details now cannot be looked up at all: they're private static members.
  * This potentially eliminates the need for `STL2_WORKAROUND_GCC_79591`, as this bug doesn't seem to surface when a `using` declaration is made in a class definition.
* Algorithm interfaces resemble what is present in ericniebler/stl2@19b9f15f3206d0a5cda9611e3f4345b8f3982d57.
  * Optimisations have been made private static members that are delegated to by the public interface. The intention is to significantly reduce the noise given by diagnostics for people unaware that algorithms can be optimised for certain concepts.
* Some, but not all, of `Rng` has been renamed to `R`.
* `safe_iterator_t` now disallows rvalues: as @CaseyCarter predicted on Slack, this is problematic when passing range adapters into algorithms.

## What's missing?

* I haven't looked at `shuffle` yet, but I imagine it'll follow the same formula. I can add it to this branch, or I can add it to a different one.

## Things that must happen before merging with master:

* The test case for `find_end` is uncommitted (and incomplete) on my work computer, so I've disabled compiling that test to get this PR up early. It'll need to be committed before merging, as there are very likely issues with `find_end` that I haven't had the opportunity to pick up on yet.
* I'd like to rebase and squash this. The commits are useless fluff, mostly so I could change between home and work computers.

## Issues this might close

* #17 constexpr extensions
* #41 Sweep the codebase for components out-of-spec to the Ranges TS WP
* #70 Re-tighten constraints on algorithms
* #188 Whither deprecated algorithm overloads?

`__construct_at` takes a reference to the place where `T` should be constructed, but this will be undefined behaviour if something is passed which is not a valid `T` object due to [dcl.ref]/5:

> There shall be no references to references, no arrays of references, and no pointers to references. The declaration of a reference shall contain an initializer ([dcl.init.ref]) except when the declaration contains an explicit extern specifier ([dcl.stc]), is a class member declaration within a class definition, or is the declaration of a parameter or a return type ([dcl.fct]); see [basic.def]. **A reference shall be initialized to refer to a valid object or function.** [ Note: In particular, a null reference cannot exist in a well-defined program, because the only way to create such a reference would be to bind it to the “object” obtained by indirection through a null pointer, which causes undefined behavior. As described in [class.bit], a reference cannot be bound directly to a bit-field. — end note ]

http://eel.is/c++draft/dcl.ref#5.sentence-3

An example would be `std::aligned_storage_t<sizeof(T), alignof(T)>`, which is storage capable of holding a `T`, but not a valid `T` object.

This can, of course, be fixed by taking a pointer instead of a reference.

I don't know if this'll cause you problems practically or if you'll have any desire to fix it, but thought I'd submit the issue all the same :)

First off this is repo is great, thanks a lot for all the concepts :). I recently included some of the code in a project of mine (https://github.com/andyg7/Graph-Library) and have noticed something weird. Whenever I include some of the stl2 code in my project, I seem to be able to access private member functions and variables in basically all classes/structs.

For example, the following does compile:
[does_compile.tiff.pdf](https://github.com/CaseyCarter/cmcstl2/files/906704/does_compile.tiff.pdf)
even though y is a private variable.

However, when I comment out the included files like this:
[does_not_compile.tiff.pdf](https://github.com/CaseyCarter/cmcstl2/files/906708/does_not_compile.tiff.pdf)
The code does not compile (as we would expect). 

Has anyone seen this issue before?

I am using the linear algebra library Armadillo, which defines a matrix as `arma::Mat<T>` class template, and a fixed matrix as `arma::Mat<T>::fixed<Rows, Cols>` nested class template. There are two tricky things:

- Armadillo returns a const lvalue reference for its `operator=` functions.
- `arma::Mat<T>::fixed<Rows, Cols>::operator=` returns a (const) `arma::Mat<T>`, which is convertible to `arma::Mat<T>::fixed<Rows, Cols>`.

After discussing with its author, I tried removing all the `const` in the return type of `operator=`. However, the second bullet still prevents the `Assignable` requirement from working. I tried changing

			requires(T t, U&& u) {
				{ t = (U&&)u } -> Same<T>&&;
			};

to

			requires(T t, U&& u) {
				{ t = (U&&)u } -> T;
			};

or

			requires(T t, U&& u) {
				{ t = (U&&)u } -> ConvertibleTo<T>&&;
			};

But I could not make it work. This hack works:

			requires(T t1, T t2, U&& u) {
				{ t1 = (t2 = (U&&)u) };
			};

I.e. the result of assignment can be used in assignment again. Not nice. Do you have a better solution? Or should we simply remove the return type check completely?

I think Armadillo’s approach is valid (for reusing the code), and its behaviour is quite normal without the concept checks. It would be a surprise that it should fail such a simple concept check. What change can be made to make it pass the concept check? (I think `arma::Mat` and `arma::Mat::fixed` should pass `Semiregular`—its `operator==` is a bit unconventional, though, and should fail `EqualityComparable` and thus `Regular`.)",NA,FALSE,https://api.github.com/repos/CaseyCarter/cmcstl2,https://api.github.com/repos/CaseyCarter/cmcstl2/issues/93/labels{/name},https://api.github.com/repos/CaseyCarter/cmcstl2/issues/93/comments,https://api.github.com/repos/CaseyCarter/cmcstl2/issues/93/events,https://github.com/CaseyCarter/cmcstl2/issues/93,NA

Interestingly, none of the standard output iterators (ostream(buf) or the various insert iterators) are affected since their `operator*` returns `*this` by reference. :-)

Given that `FunctionType<F>` is very often a reference type, and `CopyConstructible` does not intentionally admit reference types, this is a mess.

The specifications of the algorithms otherwise ignore the value semantics (destruction, copy, move) of callables. Library functions accept them as value parameters, so they must at least satisfy `Destructible`. Library functions forward them to other library functions that accept them as value parameters, so they must at least satisfy `MoveConstructible`. Should they be `CopyConstructible`? The question boils down to whether or not we want a library function implementation to be able to pass callables to multiple other library functions in ""raw"" form or if it must first cook them with `as_function`. E.g., given:

``` c++
template <InputIterator I, Sentinel<I> S, class Pred, class Proj>
  requires IndirectRegularCallable<Pred, Projected<I, Proj>>()
I foo_helper1(I, S, Pred, Proj);

template <InputIterator I, Sentinel<I> S, class Pred, class Proj>
  requires IndirectRegularCallable<Pred, Projected<I, Proj>>()
I foo_helper2(I, S, Pred, Proj);

template <InputIterator I, Sentinel<I> S, class Pred, class Proj>
  requires IndirectRegularCallable<Pred, Projected<I, Proj>>()
I foo(I i, S s, Pred pred, Proj proj);
```

can I implement `foo` as:

``` c++
return foo_helper2(foo_helper1(i, s, pred, proj), s, pred, proj);
```

Or must I instead write:

``` c++
auto&& pred_ = as_function(pred);
auto&& proj_ = as_function(proj);
return foo_helper2(foo_helper1(i, s, pred_, proj_), s, pred_, proj_);
```

For the time being, I think it's best to err on the side of the most stringent requirements - allowing the most freedom for algorithm implementations - and require callables to satisfy `CopyConstructible`. STL1 requires predicates to be `CopyConstructible`, so this is not a breaking change in any case.

I've used the simple configuration, all is fine. Music is Sync from the NAS to the PI Music folder, I can see the Dashcam icon running on the screen. I can save clips (which are present on the USB CAM drive when mounted on a PC)...
BUT...
when I park the car, the PI comes on the Wifi, but do not sync the files on the NAS.
I've checked mounting is possible with my config - ok
I can ssh - ok

here is my  /boot/teslausb-headless-setup.log

I've launched a setup since, it installed some more files, checked the system but still I have this issue...This is why the following file is long...

I built this using nginx, PHP and [ResponsiveFileManager](https://www.responsivefilemanager.com/). 

I am happy to share my code here, but I don't know how to go about that. The setup procedure I use is to first setup the web server and my scripts on the Pi and then run setup_teslausb from this repository to make the Pi read-only. I am not good with shell scripting, so I don't know how to integrate this into the excellent headless setup procedure developed here. If there is any interest in integrating the website feature into this project, please let me know!

I'm new to linux (develop mostly on windows (.Net)) so it was a very interesting experience learning how to work with a distribution and PI in general.

I ran into a few snags while setting up and it took me a decent amount of time to figure out what was going wrong. I'll list each below, it may help others running into something similar.

1) Hidden SSID, will not connect to Wifi:
This took me a while to crack. I burnt tens of raspbian and OneStepSetup images to identify why it would work in 1 scenario and not the other.

It all boiled down to the scan_ssid=1 variable not being present in the network object for wpa_supplicant.conf.

For my hidden (non broadcasting SSID) it only works when this field is present. I believe this should be mentioned in the tutorial and coded into the OneStepSetup. Will help people like me make sense of the failures.

2) Unescaped '!' in the variable values can cause the script to break.
The second issue I ran into once I figured out the Wifi was, usb drives would not show up. The cam and music files were not mounted and the archive settings were missing in /etc/fstab (as well as the creds file ) using the OneStepSetup.

When I tried the manual setup and executed the export command for the password with '!', it returned an error which made me realize that '!' was being considered an operator.

I would suggest this be added to the documentation as well so people new to linux know how to properly used escape character and avoid causing the setup to fail.

3) ArchiveLoop does not seem to be running:
Once I fixed both of these issues, I placed a test file named ""Saved-test.mp4"" with some garbage data to see if the file will transfer to the archive share.

I was unable to get the file to move to the share. Not sure what I'm missing, I tried to manually execute /root/bin/archiveloop but no luck.

Also, there are no logs in the /tmp folder for archiveloop. Although, going through the code and doing a file search I was able to find that the archiveloop.log file is being written to /mutable/archiveloop.log

I'd appreciate some feedback and direction on how to get this to work. I'll try plugging it into the car and see what happens.

Thanks again for all your work.

Changes:
* `backingfiles` is created as btrfs (and tools are installed)
* vfat disks are mounted at the start of the loop instead of in the loop. My thinking is that the normal pattern of the Pi being shut down and restarted with the car is basically a given. So fix them once each ""boot"". I don't _think_ this should be needed during the archive mount and copy
* snapshot is created/mounted/deleted during archiving, files are copied from there, and drives are never removed from the host. To see how stability is improved/isn't.

Problems:
* Since it's a snapshot, files are **copied** not moved. If we go down this path, we can figure out how to deal with that. Some people want them copied not moved anyway, so a purge algorithm might be better anyway.
* I reverted to using your partitioning logic; parted doesn't seem to be loving the way I was doing it, or I ended up creating a bug. I'll figure this out separately as I like the simpler logic
* I'm missing something basic but `campercent` less than 100 ends up causing the music disk to be created too big. Again probably some basic thing I missed

It's a proof of concept, but I like it, if it tests stably (and better than using a simultaneous `ro` mount which is another option to explore). `btrfs` is used in production pretty heavily so I don't feel too worried about it...yet.

Just tested and looking good except for a minor change I'll be pushing to the image to default to your master branch. If using the conf sample file you'd probably be fine, but in mine I had fully commented out the repo/branch which made the initial script download fail. 

But this prompt happened during a manual run where partitioning which will stop the interactive setup:

Yes/No?

First time I've seen this, I'm guessing it's not going to be hit for everyone, or maybe a recent change?

I added the `-s` flag  (""script""/non-interactive) to `parted` in a new branch `more_logging` but `parted` doesn't consider this a passable error.

The best solution I could find was [this HAT by Alchemy Power](https://www.amazon.com/Alchemy-Power-Inc-Pi-Zero-UpTime-devices/dp/B073C3NJ2T). With an 800mAh battery in place, given ~250mA max draw on the Pi, that's still plenty of power even assuming fairly heavy losses. I'm planning to ignore the low battery GPIO - if you shut down on low battery, there's no signal to restart unless you press a button. I'll know more tomorrow when it arrives; for now, it seems to be pretty much the same thing as using a splitter and connecting a USB battery.

Assuming shutdown isn't an option, is there anything useful to do when we know the car's off? (Corollary problem: the car might come back on before we lose power, so there's no guarantee of a clean boot.)

I know master has moved up quite a bit, with changes to the r/o rootfs etc. I'm seeing the same issue as #22, where the file isn't being mounted, or gets mounted and then disappears and won't remount. Maybe you've fixed it since I pulled master earlier.

Anyway, here are the changes:

- Added TESLAUSB_REPO and TESLAUSB_BRANCH vars into setup-teslausb for easier development (testing off other branches, etc. 
- Removed and gitignore DS_Store files (Mac thing...)
- Instructions for Pushover in Readme
- Setup script does conditional Pushover setup based on env vars
- Added base Pushover script for now, which will conditionally get downloaded and run if credentials have been created. 
(Future plan to expand it to a debug mode so someone can get pushes for ""Connected to wifi"", ""Mounted share"", etc. Again, useful if sitting in car!)

Followed your bash, file naming, execution as I saw them. LMK if changes/improvements recommended. I'm honestly not sure why I needed two different bash `tests` for the env vars in the check function.

I have plug the drive to my Tesla and I see a partial file copied to my TM3 folder in my windows server.

However, this morning I only see that a 5mb file is copy to my shared folder under this name:
saved-front-2018-10-16_01-36.mp4 

And this file is incomplete because it is not playable.

So then, I got to the office today and directly plugged the drive into my laptop.  I don't even see this file on the drive anymore. 

So a couple of questions....(sorry, didn't mean to combine questions):
1.  Is this the correct behavior?  When the readme says ""archive"" does it mean it will delete the copied over file?  (If so, can I just assume in this case that Tesla didn't record correctly?)
2.  Or does this script require the Pi Zero to be constantly powered on? (Did I shut off the car too quickly?)
3.  Does this script record everything that start with ""Recent-....""?  Or only the ""Saved-Front-...""?

Thanks!

Went through the following steps:

1. Used Etcher on Windows PC to flash Raspbian Stretch Lite onto SD card.
2. Using mini hdmi/keyboard - did not use headless setup
3. Went through all of the steps - Archive server was reachable 
4. Set campercent to 100
5. After reboot - got an error regarding ""/mnt/archive"" - Something about unable to Mount. Everything 
    else showed OK. 
6. Wasn't sure what to do at this point, so I unplugged the pi and plugged it back into Windows PC
7. Windows showed 2 drives - One as a boot drive with around 40mb total space 20 used and one as 
    29gb empty unformatted drive. The drive was not accessible, so I tried to format as FAT32 and created 
    TeslaCam directory, but I don't think I was in a usable state regardless.  

Had a friend look at it, and it seems like the partitioning might not be giving me enough space to mount the archive? Any tips and what I should try to do next, or if I did something wrong?

And great jump on making the setup script; I was going to do that but didn't get to it yet. 👏 

Created the Pi Zero W + 64GB MicroSD setup on a Macbook with Mojave; network share is on a USB drive on a Mac Mini High Sierra. I didn't use the full `df` size, chose 40GB instead. Some notes...

1) It takes about 45 seconds to become available, sometimes less. (Maybe fsck from dirty shutdown?)
2) I didn't use your setup script, but it looks to be right. I may redo things from scratch just to help test that for you. Especially if you end up making the changes below before I do. :) 
3) The requisite improvements asks below; I might try to do them myself but it may take a couple of days to find time (and re-google-learn my bash scripting):

* **Suggest changing the hostname** in `hosts` (127.0.0.1 entry) and `hostname`. Some folks have another raspberrypi on the network and *might* get confused when they try to reconnect to `raspberrypi.local` and wonder where all their changes went. (Like *this* somebody 😉) Suggest ""teslapi"" or similar. Simple `sed` exercise likely. 
* **Optionally change mount name in vfat mount options**: I believe you can use the name options to specify something so it doesn't show as ""NO NAME"" when mounted on a computer. Definitely personal choice. 
* Not all hosts are discoverable by name; for example mine isn't. So the script lines that find the share server IP by resolving the hostname won't work for me. Suggest checking the archive name value to see if it's an IP to bypass that bit if needed. 
* I had to either set the `cifs` version option to `1.0`, or remove it (so it autonegotiates). The default of `3` didn't seem to work for me. I did also try setting the Windows compatibility option on the Mac share. Mac CIFS/SMB is often iffy anyway, so there's probably a ""most compatible"" setting, and it may change after Mojave even. I'm not going to update the share server to Mojave for a bit though, so, fine for now. 

I also changed the archive script to copy `....TeslaCam/*` instead of `....TeslaCam/saved*`, since I've seen at least one other pattern in there. (`recent-` files) This may not be the smart thing to do, not sure if it messes with the rolling recording, but if the goal is to always archive everything (which makes sense as you obviously won't be viewing in the car...), it seems to make sense. I'll have to do a solid hour drive at some point to validate if the `recent-` get compiled down to a single file (which would be a reason to keep them around); just not sure that they do.
