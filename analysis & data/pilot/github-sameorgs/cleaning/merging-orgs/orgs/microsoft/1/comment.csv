Let me lay down how the various pieces work to detail this out:

1/ The Team Chat extension is a VS Code extension that uses VS Code APIs - like to create a web view, show unread count in the status bar item. The extension can access VS Code content, since there are APIs for that. The extension is also fully open source, so you can see what API calls are being used.

2/ The extension works with multiple chat providers: Slack, Discord and VS Live Share. The extension uses APIs provided by these chat providers, and in the case of Slack, the extension uses authentication provided by the ""Slack App"" primitive. These API calls include sending/receiving messages, fetching unread counts, etc.

3/ The chat providers cannot access VS Code APIs directly, and are disconnected from the content inside the editor. In the future, we do want to make it easier for you to share things like ""code snippets"" in your chat thread - but these implementations will be sent as messages that are explicitly sent by the user over a chat provider API.

Hope this answers the question. Feel free to re-open if there's any other question",NA,https://api.github.com/repos/arjunattam/vscode-chat/issues/397/comments,https://github.com/arjunattam/vscode-chat/issues/397#issuecomment-506534894,https://api.github.com/repos/arjunattam/vscode-chat/issues/397

Let me first talk about existing muted channels, and then cover the need to mute additional channels (ones that are not relevant for development).

I was going to write that there is a bug in how we handle muted channels in Discord -- as detailed in the code below:

https://github.com/karigari/vscode-chat/blob/ec023f1ffd865f8328bb98c55c0fc256dff13377/src/extension.ts#L94-L99

This relies on the `muted` flag, but from your edits it appears like the flag does not work in upstream. I'll investigate why this is the case -- at the very least we should be able to replicate the notification preferences from Discord by default, so that muted channels on Discord are automatically muted in the extension.

On muting additional channels: I agree we need a way to do that as well, especially since more and more users are using the extension to not get distracted by chat - and have dev related chat channels for easy access. We could have an additional config for this which is restricted to the extension.

I'm going to prioritize fixing the former issue first, and then get to the second.

Going by the definitions in the [mattermost docs](https://docs.mattermost.com/help/getting-started/welcome-to-mattermost.html?highlight=workspace), this PR is relevant for teams (workspaces), not hosts. This is a change internal to a provider: the Discord provider has always supported multiple workspaces, but this change brings that to Slack. The distinction is that the Discord uses one auth token for multiple workspaces, but Slack has different tokens for different workspaces. This meant the token handling had to become provider/workspace specific -- which is the change in this PR.

Discord/Slack don't need multiple hosts support, so we don't have any building blocks for hosts as of now.

This typically happens when the workspace restricts app installations to admins only. Most slack apps are like bots, meaning once an admin installs the app, the app bot can interact with members of the workspace through the slack client. In such cases, who installed the app is irrelevant for most practical purposes, since once it is installed, everyone can use it.

However, we install the app only for a particular user - and there is no bot that interacts with other members. In this case, if the workspace restricts app installs to admins, only admins can use Team Chat for vscode.

One way to fix this to change the app installation restriction to ""pre-approved apps"". In this case, admins still have control on which apps can be installed, but all users can then install the approved apps. I understand this isn't ideal, but I don't think there is any other way - happy to be corrected.

Attaching screenshot for the [slack app settings page](https://slack.com/apps/manage/permissions). Note that **Approved Apps** and **Sign in with Slack** are both enabled.

When the OAuth succeeds, we can open vscode using a system-level URI, and vscode invokes the extension to handle the URI.

For more info on this, you can check out the [registerUriHandler](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api#window.registerUriHandler) method in the vscode documentation. From the docs:

> the `my.extension` extension registers a uri handler, it will only be allowed to handle uris with the prefix `product-name://my.extension`.

The extension does not need any server/backend, aside from the chat backend itself (slack/discord). So the extension only communicates with the slack or discord APIs, there is no other intermediary required for the extension to work.

We do have a OAuth redirection service - for a convenient ""sign in with slack"" flow - for when you don't want to manually configure a token. This is purely for convenience, and has to be hosted at an https location since the Slack OAuth implementation restricts redirections to an https endpoint (if that was not the case, we could have used the `vscode://karigari.chat` URI, and get the redirection straight to the extension.) This OAuth redirection service is hosted on AWS Lambda right now, and the source code is available in this repo.",NA,https://api.github.com/repos/arjunattam/vscode-chat/issues/267/comments,https://github.com/arjunattam/vscode-chat/issues/267#issuecomment-454676093,https://api.github.com/repos/arjunattam/vscode-chat/issues/267

In the video provided, I had just updated Code (noticed it was behind), re-opened the window, and immediately opened devtools and cleared the jank unrelated to LiveShare.

The console output is quite heavy from start to finish, so I went ahead and created a second screen cast that covers opening Code, opening devtools, slowly scrolling pre-LiveShare output, opening LiveShare/chat, and tinkering.

I observed the following behaviors:

1. [The `find` error seems to be thrown on every `window.focus` event while the chat is open.](https://youtu.be/mVL2aGKZ--A?t=129)
2. I get an issue pertaining to `extensions.chat.updateMessages` when chat is opened.
3. I get an issue pertaining to `extensions.chat.sendMessage` when a message is sent.
2. `""cannot convert undefined or null to object""` happens when chat is opened _and_ closed. But the errors have slightly different traces.

When chat is opened:

I understand how this would have been a problem for you, and I want to take this seriously. Please let me understand how this happened, and we can then find a resolution that works.

The extension does not do such a thing by itself. My hypothesis is that this was caused by the one-click Live Share session initiation ([as given in the Readme](https://github.com/karigari/vscode-chat#with-slack-and-discord)) - which allows you to start a Live Share session with a contact/channel, and this then shares the invite with them. This gets triggered by clicking on the share icon next to the name of the channel.

If this is what happened, the user experience on the action should be improved, and we could add a confirmation to make it clear that it will share the LS link on the channel. That way, it would not be a surprise. I realize that it is actually very easy to accidentally click the icon, when one wants to click on the row to open the channel instead.

Again, apologies for the bad ux, and the unexpected outcome. It would be great if you could verify this, and I would then proceed to release a build with the fix",NA,https://api.github.com/repos/arjunattam/vscode-chat/issues/246/comments,https://github.com/arjunattam/vscode-chat/issues/246#issuecomment-430678792,https://api.github.com/repos/arjunattam/vscode-chat/issues/246

I haven't been able to isolate the issue, but I was able to identify a few improvements that to potentially fix this:

- use RTM (Websocket) for sending messages. since we have an open WS for receiving messages already, we can use the same transport for sending, and avoid any inconsistencies + additional rate limits. This was avoided earlier because of some open issues in the slack node dependency, which seem to have been fixed
- 5000 users can potentially lead to rate limiting on the `users.list` API. since we don't specify a `limit` while making the call, the slack node dependency auto-paginates the result (with 200 default page size), which will result in a burst of API calls. however, it is unclear whether this should affect the `chat.postMessage` call
- similarly, we also make a call to fetch historical unreads by calling every channel individually, which will could cause a rate limit error. we probably should switch to using the `conversations.list` API, so that our channels store is restricted to the user's channels only. [docs](https://api.slack.com/methods/channels.list)
- listen for `rate_limited` errors on the http client, so that we have more visibility on which calls are failing and how long to wait before the next call. [docs](https://slackapi.github.io/node-slack-sdk/web_api#rate-limit-handling)

The current discord token setup is not ideal, I agree.

As mentioned in [our docs](https://github.com/karigari/vscode-chat/blob/master/docs/DISCORD.md), the goal is to move to Discord RPC when it comes out of private beta. With that, all API calls will be mirrored via RPC, and authentication will use the Discord OAuth flow.

The [current ToS](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002192352-Automated-user-accounts-self-bots-) prevent automating user accounts. I'm not a legal expert, but afaik, we are not automating any user activities with this extension. Happy to be corrected if you think differently.

While I think the idea is great, I'm pretty sure it is against the Discord ToS. I'm not a Discord developer, but from my experience working with Discord, any use of user tokens outside of the official Discord client is classified as ""automating user accounts"", and isn't allowed as such.

As an example, Discord have recently started removing the authorization token from `localStorage` on start-up, in an attempt to prevent users from grabbing their auth token. Of course, there are ways to work around it (like the link you provided in your docs, using an API request) but IMO, Discord has made their stance loud and clear on this - don't use user tokens.

I have been investigating this, but I'm not able to repro the bug. Can we verify the internal data structure on your machine:

1. Run the `Toggle developer tools` command in vscode
2. Type the following in the console window that opens up:

```
JSON.parse(window.localStorage.getItem('storage://global/karigari.chat')).users
```

This will print an object that stores Slack users. For deactivated users, we need to confirm that the `isDeleted` property is set to true.

Notice the `""delete""` key. I would say there needs to be a filter on the value. Akin to this:

```js
getUsers(): Promise<Users> {
    return this.client.apiCall(""users.list"", {}).then((response: any) => {
      const { members, ok } = response;
      let users: Users = {};

      if (ok) {
        // refer to next line
        members = members.filter(member => !member.deleted);
        members.forEach(member => {
          const { id, profile, real_name, name } = member;
          const { display_name, image_72, image_24 } = profile;
          users[id] = {
            id,
            // Conditional required for bots like @paperbot
            name: display_name ? display_name : name,
            fullName: real_name,
            imageUrl: image_72,
            smallImageUrl: image_24,
            isOnline: undefined
          };
        });

        return users;
      }
});
```

The third party server (which runs on https://vscode.chat) handles the OAuth redirection only. The service does not store the token anywhere - just passes it from slack to the extension.

You can verify this in the source code of the service here: https://github.com/karigari/vscode-chat/tree/master/oauth-service. Happy to point you to the right areas if you'd like to review.

API client in mattermost-redux is too heavy-to-use in 3rd party app that doesn't need store integration.

And this project currently using Axios and TypeScript so maybe you can't get any advantage from it.

Thank you, I definetly will, when I face any issues 👍. However there is still plenty of basic functionality to implement such as create posts which should be quite straight forward to implement.
One issue that came up: The GUI cannot get images via the eariler retrieved image URL, because the GUI is not aware of the personal access token that is used for API calls (and it also should not know it?).

1. Can you share the logs from the output channel? You can click on ""output"" in the bottom bar and select ""slack chat"" in the dropdown (image for reference below)
2. Did you try reloading the window by any chance after setting the token? You can select ""reload window"" from the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P on windows)
3. The step right after the authentication is to store the token in your system credential vault. Is it possible to check if tokens were saved there? We use `vscode-chat` as the service name to store tokens.

## Setup
1. Download the `chat-0.6.0-pre-3.vsix` file from the link given above
2. Open VS Code, and select the **Extensions: Install from VSIX** command from the command palette
3. Reload VS Code after the installation

## Authentication
To use Discord inside VS Code, you need to have your Discord token. To obtain your token, follow the steps [given here](https://discordhelp.net/discord-token).

This is an unofficial token setup, one that is used by other Discord clients ([Discline](https://github.com/MitchWeaver/Discline), [terminal-discord](https://github.com/xynxynxyn/terminal-discord)), and the recommended approach by a Discord team member, as [given here](https://github.com/discordapp/discord-api-docs/issues/69#issuecomment-223886862):

> Instead, log in on the discord client, pop open the web inspector, (ctrl/cmd shift I), and type localStorage.token in the console to get your auth token.

The goal is to move to [Discord RPC](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/topics/rpc#proxied-api-requests) in the near-term, which supports proxied API/websocket requests with OAuth. Discord RPC is in private beta at the moment. If you have any suggestions to improve this flow, please share.

Once you have the token, run the following commands from the VS Code command palette

1. Run **Slack: Configure Access Token**, select ""Discord"", and paste your token in the input box. This will save the token to your system keychain.
2. Next, you will be prompted to choose your primary Discord guild (similar to Slack workspaces). If you don't want to select now, you can run the **Slack: Change Workspace** command to select your guild.

## Known issues

1. The extension is still branded as a ""Slack"" client, which can get confusing for Discord users.
2. For large communities (like Reactiflux, with 2.5k members) fetching member data can be very slow. Currently the extension only fetches data up to 500 members.
3. Unreads are counted only updated after the extension has been activated, which means messages that were received before you open VS Code are not counted into the unread count.
4. ~Message reactions, edits, file attachments, link unfurls are not supported currently. Live share (and other) links are not rendered as clickable.~ (fixed in build 3)
5. ~Users that are not a part of your selected guild, but with open direct messages are not fetched. These will appear as bare ids.~ (fixed in build 3)
6. Live share invitations can only be sent to users that have an ongoing DM chat on Discord (new DMs are not created by the extension)
7. For large communities, a loader is required while member/channel data is fetched. There is no loader currently
8. The current guild name is not displayed anywhere, which can be a cause of confusion (feedback welcome!)
9. ~For large communities, performance is sluggish at times while updating data in the tree view~ (fixed in build 2)
10. ~Reloading the vs code window prompts for workspace, even when the workspace had been previously selected~ (fixed in build 2)

I understand the concern, and want to find a way out for us here. Before suggesting solutions, I do want to stress that the Slack token is only stored inside your system keychain, and only you have access to it. I can point to specific areas in the source code if it helps to verify.

Unfortunately Slack permissions do not have a way to restrict scope to a single channel. The only way we could accomplish this is by creating a new Slack user account for your workspace, and adding that user to the workspace as a ""single channel guest"". The same user account can then be used to authenticate through the VS Code extension.

Another possibility that we could explore is to make some permissions scopes optional, depending on your use-case.

1. For the messages issue: Currently, rendering the message only happens if the Slack API response for sending the message is successful. Which means this issue can happen if the API returns an error or if the network connection was flaky. We will be able to diagnose this better if you could send the contents of the output channel for Slack Chat.

If the token was revoked manually or automatically, it should show/output some kind of error message in the UI of VS Code.

> Yes, you are right to point out that the API key is sensitive. We should be storing that in the system keychain using keytar to ensure that there is no unauthorized access. Adding keychain support is on my list of to-dos. 

You should not store the API key in the `settings.json` file. It is possible that people might use a extension like `sync setting` in that case, it is like sharing the API key in public.

If you any to hide the API for getting exposed, here what you can do.

You can see how [Sync Settings](https://github.com/shanalikhan/code-settings-sync) store the Gist token securely in VS Code _(not sure even that is the secure way to store the API keys or access token, I suggest you ask the VS Code for the same)_, without getting exposed. Sync Settings store the access token in `syncLocalSettings.json` inside `User` folder.

> Can you share why the token had to be revoked?

I got an email from slack.

> We recently became aware that one or more authentication tokens for your Slack workspace, codecarrot.slack.com, have been posted publicly on the Internet. This can happen when a developer or other member of your organization posts their private token on a public forum or website (usually a code-sharing website like GitHub).

That my access token has been permanently disabled, that has happened becuase slack found out that my API is publicly available on Github since I was using `sync setting`.

> In most cases this would be enough for the kind of urls I tend to click on in my main Slack workspace.

I would love to know more about the urls you tend to click from Slack. Could you elaborate on a few of these, and what you would like to achieve by opening them in VS Code?

I've been thinking about this too, but perhaps in a slightly different way. The links I frequently click are Github links (eg, a link to a commit) or CI links (eg, a failed build on Travis). I've been thinking of integrating these natively to reduce my context switches. For example,

At my workplace we revolve around Bitbucket, so the majority of them are that. There's also the occasional Youtube video also. Are you suggesting you'd prefer to whitelist which domains open in a tab? I'm not expecting to achieve much, just a tab opening with the clicked link, loading the content. I don't care for history, bookmarks or navigation buttons. (Imagine when you click a link in Slack on Android and it opens the ""dumb browser"" which has just an X button to close it. That's basically what I'd like.)

Also, what if the browser was configurable? At work (where I use VSCode the most) we have CentOS 7 and for whatever reason it's bugged with Google Chrome such that if I declare it my default browser, it kills my session each time I click on a link from outside Chrome regardless of application. :(

Nobody in our tech teams managed to figure out why so to bypass this I set my default browser to Firefox, which I never use willingly. This means each time I click a link in VSCode (in general, not necessarily just from your neat Slack extension) then it waits several seconds and opens firefox instead of a new tab in chrome which is what I'd prefer.

If we had control over the command that calls the browser, maybe I could make VSCode Slack links open in Chrome and not destroy my session. I'd be willing to experiment if you were to provide a setting for this.

It's not that the count is too high, in Slack those channels do not have any unreads at all but in VS Code it shows 1 or more unreads.

Unfortunately there's no easy way for us to debug your extension state, but perhaps I'll add some logging in the next release to know better. I did however find a scenario where this can be reproduced in my workspace.

- user A and user B are having a conversation in a thread on a channel
- user C is also on the channel, but not participating in this thread
- user C's slack does not show any unread count for the channel or for any thread. but when vscode is loaded with the extension it shows an unread count which cannot be changed by marking channel as read

(Note to self: this happens because the thread messages are recent by timestamp but not loaded when we call for channel history. That means “mark as read” does not know the latest timestamp and hence fails)

I've found myself asking people to start a session, and this will simplify that. I have released v0.4.0 with an early implementation of `/live request`.

![mgwjsa2j5h](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/284612/42387394-c61b8bf4-815f-11e8-9c02-c1bb872560d2.gif)

There are some improvements/questions as a result of my first impressions on the flow. I'm planning to iron them out with the next few releases. Specifically,

1. I've kept the implementation stateless right now, but that can create some unintuitive scenarios. For example, multiple `/live request` in the same channel means multiple ""Accept"" links - clicking any of which will start a session. There is no state around the link being ""accepted"", and perhaps expired. I don't think that is required...
2. ...except for giving interaction feedback. While clicking on ""accept"" triggers the ""Sharing..."" in the status bar, it can be easily missed in normal usage - which keeps the user really hanging, and feels incomplete. Need to evaluate if others feel the need for this feedback too, and add that. Perhaps we could mimic the Slack app [message buttons behavior](https://api.slack.com/docs/message-buttons)
3. The initiator can auto-join the Live Share link as you have suggested - I was thinking of checking for the following condition: ""if live share URL received and `/live request` sent by user in the last 15 mins, then auto-join""
4. Currently, joining the link reloads the VS Code window and loads the remote project. With an explicit click to join, this seems ok. But with auto-join, the window will reload itself on receiving a message, and might appear arbitrary to the user. Reloading the window also removes the Slack webview, which makes it look like a completely new context. Due to this, I'm not sure if auto-joining will give the correct user experience. Any thoughts on how to improve this?

I'm going to use `/live request` more in my day-to-day use, and see if that changes my early impressions.

1. What if we added a ""Dismiss"" link, that would expire/invalidate the request. That way, anytime an action was taken on the request (either accept or dismiss), the message would ""invalidate"".

2. I also like the suggestion of mimicking the message button behavior. From a UI-perspective, it might also look nicer to render buttons, as opposed to links. But thats lower priority

3. As I think about it, I'm not sure whether auto-joining makes total sense, so we should just hold off on that for now, and get a feel for the experience.

Regarding the user presence comment, I'd definitely love to discuss this! We actually started discussing whether Live Share should provide an abstract concept of user presence, that would allow extensions to implement 1) list of users, 2) whether those users are available, 3) a mechanism to communicate the share session with them. That way, Live Share itself could allow you to share with someone, using different communication mechanisms under the covers.

1. Host (left in gif) clicks on an online user to invite them
2. This creates a Live Share session (if not already available) and sends the link over Slack
3. When the recipient (right in gif) receives the link, she gets prompted with join/ignore actions

These changes are WIP, over at #38. We could perhaps have a similar experience for reverse initiation. Personally, I haven't used the `/live request` command much, but that could just be me.

Also, we could show online users (as ""users available for collab"") in the new Live Share tree view, with a one-click action to invite them.

There is an issue with this code.

When I made this update I integrated it into my application, but I never built the application only ran a watch. 

Now that I am attempting to build I am running into a couple of issues.

1.) You can't have numbers as keys in the configuration
2.) You can't have function expressions in the configuration

It looks like the common practice to get around this is to exported a factory function to create the object. 

I will resolve this and submit a new pull request.

Thanks @assuncaocharles 

I did check this when I found it looking through other issues, which works fine for a click event, but if I wanted to add the data to different stores and just call those functions `OnInit` for example:

```
ngOnInit() {
  /**
  * This will add everything to the animals store
  */
  this.addToPeople();
  this.addToAnimals();
}
```

But I did find that setting a timeout *works*:

```
this.addToPeople();
setTimeout(() => {
  this.addToAnimals();
}, 300);
```

[Here's a fork](https://codesandbox.io/s/angular-9zvz3) of your CodeSandbox with an example of these.

It only surfaces the play/skip buttons and no browsing buttons.

It would be cooler to have it be the exact same UI but with a different ""output"" device selected.

Honestly as a temporary workaround, have you thought about just putting a bluetooth receiver in place of the computer attached to the speakers?

Implementation-wise I think you're right, I think the neatest way to control it would be to replace the ""player"" class with a ""RemotePlayer"" and have all the controls go through WebRTC to the other machine. You'll have to deal separately with surfacing the UI state (play/pause won't update, seek position won't update, etc), but that should be the basics of what you're trying to achieve.

Sweet project! I like a lot of aspects of what you've done, really nailing the user adoption with the server setup vid / platform support!

I'm actually taking Stretto in a rather different direction with the next version (see [next](https://github.com/benkaiser/stretto/tree/next) branch), with the aim being to use youtube videos / soundcloud songs as the backing tracks for the entire library, and only needing one server to store the users data / keep it in sync across devices but never having to store the music files themselves.
I'm planning cool features for that like import from Spotify and in-built soundcloud feed browsing but they are still in the works.
You can try out what I have working so far on this page:
https://next.kaiserapps.com/

So as you can see from this direction the underlying fundamentals are quite different, with my main goal being to make it way easier for users to switch to Stretto and not having to handle massive amounts of user media content.

I guess the 'smart' part is where it gets more tricky. We currently have
the ""generate a mix"" feature when you right-click a song to find similar
songs like it and explore that way. Those mixes aren't saved / stored in
any way though, which I guess is another improvement I'd like to make in
the `next` Stretto.

That sounds like a great implementation, so if I'm understanding correctly it tries to use the default encoding of the file-type but if that fails it transcodes it into mp3?

As for Cast support, it'd be simply sending the music directly instead of using casting tabs, just an idea that might work better, but I'm not sure if it'll be done.

We don't currently have any testing for Stretto at all. And that alone is a
huge issue. But I feel like things really need to be re-architected in
order to add proper tests for the application. And to do that would be a
solid effort, would probably take me several full days work.

That sounds like an interesting use. Is it in a retail setup? or more personal use?

Regarding the mobile version being broken, I looked at the mobile version on master and it appears to be playing songs, changing playlists, etc just fine. Is their more information you can give than ""doesn't run the js functions"", which js functions / what isn't happening?
As for forcing the desktop version. If it's a permanent thing you can just remove the mobile detection from `routes/index.js:107`.

Answering your specific questions:
1. Possibly but I doubt it, I own a nexus 6p running Marshmellow, so that is the version of android I'm not experiencing it on. Also I use chrome beta, but they shouldn't really differ too much at all.
2. Well you can build it with the same idea in mind, but it would have to be a complete rewrite to Java. I have thought about creating an android app and did some research / initial work with nativescript a few months back (a technology that compiles javascript to native Java/Objective-C. But the platform was still in it's infancy and wasn't ready for me to build an app just yet. Also there is a lot of work in it and I for the foreseeable future will be quite busy with my university studies and then working.
3. Nope, not really. Most issues I get from people are either feature suggestions or issues with the desktop version.
4. It's mostly as simple as changing the bootstrap theme Stretto is using. But there are a few other things that have colors (the songs when you click them, etc) that you will want to change to match your color palette.

Because I had to build again today I decided to automate it, and so that has been done so future builds should be much faster / less hassle.

If you run the application, you will actually notice that if you fire up a web browser you will be able to go to http://localhost:2000 and you'll also see the music player!

The application window that gets drawn is using a framework called Electron, that allows Node.js applications that create a server (like Stretto) to be viewed as an application window and also generates binaries for multiple platforms.

If you would like to run the server component on it's own, simply [clone the source and run the installation steps](https://github.com/benkaiser/stretto#dev-installation-instructions).

I'll try add it tonight, might not do a complete rebuild / re-release, but
I'll add it to master. If I don't however, then I'll add it to Trello.

I'm thinking for now just hardcoding them is fine. But maybe down the track
I wouldn't mind having it user-customisable.

Yeah I'm still not to sure. I would definitely want to keep the current
functionality default and just allow some hard config rules (so they can't
be enabled via web interface) to enable authentication and such. But I'm
still not certain about how to do that yet / have the time to implement it.

Your best bet is putting it behind a proxy. I would recommend nginx, as it
allows you to port forward from 80 (or 443 for https) to whatever port you
have it running on, along with using certificates along the way. If you get
stuck with this I have some nginx configs (not https, but there's others on
the internet for that) that I could share with you if you'd like.

I've changed the public demo to use the `no_ui_settings` version. It simply changes the view, if someone mucked around in the console and fired the changes themselves it would work just fine. The code is open source after all.

Thanks for chiming in. I have had thoughts on this idea. However this is how I would like to solve it:
- Music is still always served to clients
- when a client gives itself a remote name (through the remote setup dialog), others can control it

Currently the capacity of this is only to let the others control it through commands such as:

```
http://localhost:2000/command/my_remote_name/playpause
http://localhost:2000/command/my_remote_name/prev
http://localhost:2000/command/my_remote_name/next
```

(see README for how I setup keyboard shortcuts for this).

What I would like added, is a way to turn a current player into a controlling mode, where it looks exactly the same, but every click / command is delivered to the player it is controlling. This wouldn't be too complex, what would need changing is all the functions in the `static/js/player/player.js` would need to be changed to (when in controlling mode) push the command through to the remote player.

This would solve your requirements (I hope) if you just ran the player on the server (would need chrome or firefox installed), then you can opt in the other clients to remote control it. 

It's not high on my list of priorities to implement currently, but you are welcome to have a go at it and submit a PR if you want. I'm also happy to give you advice on implementation if you need it!

@mohammadrezaprw :
First of all, dude, you have a massive library. That's just of the chain.
Currently we send a message of all the songs on load. One optimisation I would like to consider is caching that song info locally in localstorage, and somehow using checksums or something to work out if we need to resend on page load. However with some initial tests on the feasibility of this, my 7233 song library hits 300KB of data, and with a localStorage limit of 5MB (without extending it), 90000 songs at on average the same attribute length would be 3.73MB almost hitting the limit.

We could send them in chunks when the page first loads, but because this is trying to be a music player experience that could rival desktop apps, I feel slow loading from a server when scrolling and whatnot would make it feel clunky, so I would always like to be sending all the data on page load.

If you want to submit a PR for sending the songs down in 1000 song chunks or so I'd be happy to look at that.

No promises tho ;)

For future reference to people looking for how to solve the jquery and bootstrap slider issues, turns out because in Electron the `module` global variable is set in the browser, it messes up jquery (and hence slider, because it uses jquery). The solution for me, because I didn't care about node-integration in the browser was to add `'node-integration' = false` in my BrowserWindow options like so:

``` javascript
mainWindow = new BrowserWindow({width: 800, height: 600, 'node-integration': false});
```

Alternatively you'll have to require jquery (and the slider... not 100% sure how to do that) into the browser window directly, see: https://github.com/atom/electron/issues/254

Thanks for taking interest! Glad to hear it's running fine on your windows machine (I'm a linux user myself).

Okay so the client and server communicate via sockets. On the client you should see in various files (just search in project for `socket.emit` to get an idea of what they look like). Then in the server side there is `socket.on` calls, that then go to a function. That function should probably pass it on to the `library_functions.js` file, which would then call the unlinking of the file and removing it from the database.

Let me know if you need any other pointers on how to design this. Also if you you get your code into an almost-completed state, then submit a PR and I can give you feedback on a line-level and we can work though any other issues.

As always, it's awesome to have other people contributing to this project :+1: thanks!

I'm guessing what you are trying to achieve here is to have the commands control the play behaviour of the app? If so there is already a way to do that!

I noticed your `integreation.js` file simply wraps around the `player.someMethod()` calls, can you simply invoke the method on `player` from csharp?

Anyway how I have it working, is that you can run nmp through a browser, click the button in the bottom right `Remote Setup` and set the computer name. Then you can fire off calls to the server to remote control that terminal!
e.g. If I named my machine `example` then I can fire off the following calls:

```
// toggle play state
http://localhost:2000/command/example/playpause
// previous track
http://localhost:2000/command/example/prev
// next track
http://localhost:2000/command/example/next
```

And under linux I let my window manager ([i3](https://i3wm.org/)) do all the key binding / request:

```
bindsym $mod+XF86AudioPlay exec curl http://localhost:2000/command/example/playpause
bindsym $mod+XF86AudioPrev exec curl http://localhost:2000/command/example/prev
bindsym $mod+XF86AudioNext exec curl http://localhost:2000/command/example/next
```

I don't know what the equivalent in windows is, but just find some application that can fire requests to urls on keybinding.
http://www.autohotkey.com/ might be one tool that could do the job. Otherwise you could just use your app to sit in the background and recognise the hotkeys.

First of all, when running, neither `cheerio` or `underscore` have been added to the `package.json`, you can add them automatically when installing them by passing the `--save` flag.

Secondly, the app crashes on use:

I'll let you work out the root cause of that.

One other thing I noticed is that you are hitting the API and retrieving the HTML data and parsing it with `cheerie`... Wouldn't it be simpler to call the wikia api with `&fmt=json` to get JSON data that can simply be parsed using `JSON.parse(data)` in javascript?

I looked at their documentation and in the [overview section](http://api.wikia.com/wiki/LyricWiki_API) it states:

> This process is different from the original API which used to return the full lyrics in the API result. This had to be changed due to licensing restrictions.

Due to this I am not interested in the music player displaying partial lyrics.

And the solution you have provided, although rather awesome in how it works to show the full lyrics, they are not legally allowed to release the full lyrics via API and using a scraper (which is essentially what your solution does) is a very messy solution.

On a side note, they do have a `realjson` format that outputs proper json that is easy to parse like so:

```
request('http://lyrics.wikia.com/api.php?artist=owl%20city&title=fireflies&fmt=realjson', function(error, response, body) {
  var cleanLyrics = JSON.parse(body);
  console.log(cleanLyrics.lyrics);
});
```

Perhaps one cool task if you are interested in scraping, would be to scrape every single lyric from their website and create your own open API for the tracks. I'll donate you some cpu cycles on one of my servers if you want to host that solution somewhere :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

 I've made some changes and pushed them to the [rhnvrm-master branch](https://github.com/benkaiser/node-music-player/tree/rhnvrm-master). There are only a few more changes / things I'd like you to think about before I merge.
1. Return the string from the API without quotes, they currently all have double quotes around them. A nicer way would be to send JSON from your API, and then to parse that JSON on the Node Music Player end. Would be good if you also had some way of communicating back to node music player if you were unable to find the lyrics (then if we need to, we could handle this differently).
2. Have a think about how the lyrics box is very small. From a user perspective it would be nice if they could resize it. Is this possible with something like css flexbox maybe? You don't have to implement this, but I'd like you to suggest some options and I can work on them in the future :)
3. Also have a think about, and write in a response here what your plan is regarding storing these for the songs? it would be awesome to write them at least to the Node Music Player database, and then check there before sending a request off again later.

On your server also, do you have any caching in place? So that if the same item is requested 10000 times it only hits the wikia servers once? That would be useful to ensure that if many many people use this feature in node music player, your server can handle it :)

Having just done a quick google search for how to do so, and the best solutions are ones like scrape the page and hope those tags are visible from within your country / that video is popular enough to support them.

I think @RolfKoenders solution sounds nice regarding prompting the user how they would like the information split (a choice between which one should be artist and which should be title).
A higher priority on my list is fixing the iTunes auto-find info. Currently it just picks the first result and assumes that is the right info and updates the inputs, but a nicer, more user-friendly way would be to show a list of options and let the user pick or opt to cancel if none of them are correct (often the case). One of the biggest annoyances for me is when it autofinds the info but it's part of some collection or album that the actual song isn't from (e.g. I want it's original album but it gives me the information and coverart for some compilation album).

This is a mopidy (https://www.mopidy.com/) server on raspbian (a third party debian port) running on Raspberry pi. This is also why the swap is off by default (the RPi uses an sd-card as a drive and it is not good in the long run to write on it, as it has a limited amount of read/write operations that can be performed on it). Something like your sofware should come by default with pimusicbox imo. It does share music by default with Samba, but for some situations that is not enough.

I don't have the technical competence to understand as much but it might be that there could have been some easier way to install node music player on this operating system, since it apparently uses some kind of application off node. Here I am using an older version of Raspbery pi that comes with a single core 800 mhz processor and the only problem with that is perhaps that scanning the library is a bit slow i you have lots of music. But with newer versions of RPi with more RAM and the quad-core ARM Cortex-A7 maybe would not have any problem? Unless this is I/O-limited (probably is to some extent). Other than that it workd really well!

I guess the issue is with the 'taglib', because it is not getting installed. I have tried to contact the author of taglib but the email address provided does not exist. 

```
ERR! Failed at the taglib@0.8.1 install script.
npm ERR! This is most likely a problem with the taglib package,
npm ERR! not with npm itself.
npm ERR! Tell the author that this fails on your system:

I tried to execute `npm install taglib-config` but that says:

```
ERR! 404 'taglib-config' is not in the npm registry.
npm ERR! 404 You should bug the author to publish it
npm ERR! 404 It was specified as a dependency of 'node-music-player'

I am going to find the git repo for that. Do you have link for taglib or taglib-config repos. What is your suggestion here? What am I missing?

I got the solution. So, this is what I did.  
    1. Downloaded the Mac binary from http://www.cmake.org/download/ and installed it
    2. 'Tools > Installed for the command line Use' from cmake UI
    3. Cloned the taglib repo from https://github.com/taglib/taglib.git 
    4. Installed taglib by using following commands:

```
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local -DCMAKE_RELEASE_TYPE=Release .
make
sudo make install
```

After this when I ran `taglib-config --version` command I got `1.9.1`. This solved my issue of `npm install`

You might know this already but it was a good learning for me today, so I felt like sharing the info. 

Thanks a lot for your help. Time to go and play with the node-music-player. :) yay!

The queue_pool is correct, however also keep in kind that if shuffle is on, its the shuffle pool you will want to be using.

# clone taglib from source
$ git clone https://github.com/taglib/taglib.git
# makes a directory called taglib
$ cd taglib

$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release .
$ make
# wait for it to compile
# install it
$ make install
# symlink it (it's not auto-installed to /usr/bin
$ ln -s /usr/local/bin/taglib-config /usr/bin/taglib-config
# now test it worked
$ taglib-config --version
# should show 1.9.1

Another approach would be

```
var taglib;

    taglib = false;

I think the approach should be as above, to have a try catch block around taglib then check if it's available when we want to use it. Then moving it to the `optionalDependencies` section in the `package.json`. This seems to be the best way to do it because then npm install will try to install the module but be okay if it can't find the module.

Also I would make ffmpeg an optional dependency too, not sure if that works on windows.

Can you split these into two PRs? Or make the above changes? I'm happy with the sorting / adding of discnr and tracknr, but I don't want to pull the other changes.

A key difference between node-music-player and subsonic and node-music-player is that although node-music-player works in a remote situation, it is usually run on a local computer. That said I do see that in the future running it as a remote streaming server.

I'm not sure exactly, but the cost of transcoding a song every single time a user wants to stream it sounds costly. I feel it would be a better option to convert it on the fly, but to pipe the output to both the filesystem and the response (standard output back to the client).

I also think that rather than making this the default, having a setting on the client-side that can be set that would then change the request url from `/songs/:id` to `/transcode/:id` which would transcode from whatever format it is in to mp3 (unless it is already mp3).

Do you have any coding skills to implement this? Info on the ffmpeg command that subsonic uses can be found [here](http://www.subsonic.org/pages/index.jsp). I'll take a look at the pull request if you manage to implement it (also keep in mind that I want to keep the dependency on just node.js modules so that it is easily cross-platform should I finish implementing that one day). 

I myself have [a bunch of features](https://trello.com/b/cXdOSOoR/node-music-player) I want to implement first.

I think one clear problem already (without even testing) is that does the history save when a track is popped off? Or does it get reset to what was saved last whenever a track is finished playing?

Also although there is a `.play()` method on a `PlayState.current_track`, I do believe that by trying to store a dom element inside the localstorage is not going to work...

So far I have just been relying on other application to edit id3 tags and using the hard rescan option (right click a song to find this, or you can hard rescan your entire library) to reload the songs id3 info.

I will definitely add the use case of no id3 tags sometime soon. Submit a pull request if you want and I might just pull yours and make a few tweaks.

One of the reasons I have put this off is that musicmetadata (One of the libs I use for reading the id3 tags) only has read support. Taglib, the other library I use, has write support, but no cover art reading/writing. When either of these libraries fix this issue I will be more keen to implement this.

I think your idea of passing off the id3 fetching to a third party service sounds good, but I don't think shazam (or anyone) has an api for that stuff. Let me know if you find a good royalty free / open source one with node.js support.

Nice job. Are you making it open source or?

Did you run into any browser performance issues with your player when loading so many songs into the DOM?

My UI looks good because I took a lot of ideas from the previous music service I was using. I am planning on making a mobile version to with a mobile url that works off the same javascript but with different templates, so that it is usable and looks good on a phone.

Have you tried mine much? I added search functionality today which makes it a bit more usable as a daily driver :)

Having coded on Nwazet for O1 quite a bit I have a few opinions:

- ProductPart as is has too much stuff in itself: for example, I don't think that Price and Inventory belong there, but they should rather be separate components (likely parts) that attach there as needed. I think that ProductPart should only have a SKU, and probably no other property.
- The payment infrastructure should come with a ""null"" payment implementation, for store that ""sell"" products for free.
- OrderPart right now is I think too complex and rigid: making changes and additions to it from other features is troublesome.
- Globalization: B2C ecommerces in the EU should display final prices (including tax); B2B ecommerces in the EU sometimes may not; B2C ecommerces in the US display price before tax, because taxes there change on a state-by-state basis. And this is just an example I know.
- The checkout process should have easy ways to inject behaviour between steps (e.g.: you changed your address, so we must recompute taxes; we have an inventory integration, so right before payment I check the items are still available), or even inject steps (e.g. select gift wrap).

These are just off the top of my head.",NA,https://api.github.com/repos/bleroy/Nwazet.Commerce/issues/148/comments,https://github.com/bleroy/Nwazet.Commerce/issues/148#issuecomment-394977825,https://api.github.com/repos/bleroy/Nwazet.Commerce/issues/148

Same goes with inventory for the same reason. Normally B2B requires the users to login to display prices mainly because you want to have different prices per retailers/business and also because a B2B should never sell to simple customers. You don't want to be a competition against your own retailers by displaying a lower price (wholesale price) than what's the standard retail market price.

The module was initially designed for a small-to-medium US-based business, so this sounds like a good re-calibration of the requirements. We do have multiple prices available in the current version, through extensions that have been added over time, but a re-foundation seems to be in order. Shall we build some abstractions around pricing, and let implementers of those abstractions provide their implementation? We could still ship those with a default single price implementation that corresponds to the current behavior. I suppose in light of the suggestion to have a null payment option, this would go hand in hand with a null price provider (no need to provide a part for that, I think).

I agree with @bleroy regarding having price abstractions, and I also agree with the fact that a part for price is not needed by default. I also think that such abstractions should support different ways to interact with price there, for example by ""injecting"" discounts and such.
We should also be able to have several implementations available on a tenant: for example, I may need a basic price on some products, and tiered pricing on others.
Price abstractions should also be able to ""interact"" with the shopping cart and the checkout process.

OrderPart:
My issue there is basically the same I have for ProductPart: I think too much information is being stored in a single object, and I'd rather see it spread around in more. For example, it has credit card information, but a payment may involve no credit card. There are workarounds and ways to handle that, as I did in the VAT PR where I added an interface to add stuff to the table being displayed in the order view. I think those that currently are workarounds should really be the norm, and we should have the most basic order objects, with all the other info being tacked on them.

Checkout:
I think the nicest thing would be a chance to design/configure it as a ""workflow"". Meaning, different features may provide something similar to workflow activities that can be combined together to build the checkout process for the shop.

Note that I'll talk about VAT, because that what is used in most of the world (inclouding EU): in the USA they have sales tax. There is no difference for what we are doing here, because the only actual differences are in accounting (as long as this system is not being used for specific import-export cases), so for the sake ofdiscussion here let's assume VAT and sales tax are the same and save us some time for now.

This way of handling VAT would supersede the current implementations: both `StateOrCountryTaxPart `and `ZipCodeTaxPart` could easily be ""implemented"" in the way I described above, under the assumption that there is a single product category.
Looking at the implementation of `ShoppingCartQuantityProduct`, I think it would be necessary to define (probably as a setting) a ""default category"": `ShoppingCartQuantityProduct` as a reference to the `ProductPart`, but there is nothing mandating the fact that the product should have the ContentPart we will use to mark its product category. This would play well with ""replacing"" the two tax parts above.

`ProductPart` objects have no tax-related properties in them, and this is good. I would possibly add some wording somewhere in the editor to highlight the fact that the `ProductPart.Price` is before VAT.

In `ShoppingCartBase.Taxes(decimal)` only the first `TaxAmount `is returned, being the one from the `ITax` with the highest priority (and with value greater than 0). The `ITax` objects are obtained by calling the `GetTaxes()` method of all `ITaxProvider` implementations. This makes me think that we only need one `ITax` object, that has that category/territory/rate table. The `ITaxProvider` would return that object. Extending things a bit, a very large business may actually need more than one of those objects, assuming they can have products shipped from different locations in the world. Hence, the ITax implementation for this feature would be a ContentPart, so that we may eventually have a bunch of ContentItems that have it. (I am not planning on figuring out right now how to dynamically ahndle priority there, so I'll just have an input with a number).

The other place in the code where `GetTaxes()` is called is in the `TaxAdminController`, in order to list the existing ContentItems that have been created for the taxes.

What's missing from the current taxes implementation?
We need the ability to compute taxes on single products/items based on category and region. For the ""cart total"" this is not an issue, but on the frontend, in the EU, you have to show for each product the price after application of VAT. You can do it for a ""default"" country of your choosing, and then have the customer pay the correct amount at the end (notifying them of the price change). On top of that, it would be useful to show on the editor for a product what is the price you are setting for the final customer. 
On principle, this feature could be ""attached"" to its own VATPart on the product ContentItem.

Let me know if this all makes sense so far.",NA,https://api.github.com/repos/bleroy/Nwazet.Commerce/issues/141/comments,https://github.com/bleroy/Nwazet.Commerce/issues/141#issuecomment-350027855,https://api.github.com/repos/bleroy/Nwazet.Commerce/issues/141

https://gist.github.com/MatteoPiovanelli-Laser/2bf66dcf313a8b912492e63956dfb1d2

The idea is:
 - Moving the base implementations to their own feature means that the new Nwazet.BaseTaxImplementations needs to have a migration that creates the same table
 - If Nwazet.Taxes was initially not enabled, enabling it now moves its migration version number up to 4 directly, so it does not create the tables. Nwazet.BaseTaxImplementations can then be activated without issues.
 - If you already have Nwazet.Taxes enabled, its migration has run and created the table for `StateOrCountryTaxPartRecord`.
 - At this point, for retrocompatibility, since you have Nwazet.Taxes active, Nwazet.BaseTaxImplementations needs to be activated, so that you have the same exact functionality. However, it does not have to create any table.
 - My idea was to wrap `SchemaBuilder.CreateTable` in a try...catch block.

I may change that so that rather than calling `ITax.ComputeTax()`, it calls a service to compute taxes. This way I can have stuff being injected there. The signature would look something like

`decimal TaxService<T>.ComputeTax(T ITaxImplementation, TaxContext context)`

The TaxContext would contain the parameters that are now passed to ITax.ComputeTax.  For the implementations that are already there, this service's method would call ITax.ComputeTax.

Basically, the method from `ShoppingCartBase `could become:

```
public virtual TaxAmount Taxes(decimal subTotal = 0) {

Each `VATConfigurationPart `handles a single product category (with controls to ensure categories are unique):
 - This is the part implementing `ITax`.
 - This would mean that from `TaxAdmin `we will create one tax ContentItem for each product category.
 - If in a `VATConfigurationPart` we set the category as the default one, this overrides the previous default (kind of like what happens when setting the HomePage in an `AutoroutePart`).
 - Handle somehow attempts to delete the default category.
 - We need a default category to handle the case where no category has been assigned to a product (maybe we only have one category in the whole store)
 - When in the `VATConfigurationPart` we select the hierarchy to be used for taxes there, the category is ""added"" to the `HierarchyVATPart `for the hierarchy and the `TerritoryVATPart `in all its territories (this latter part is where we will set the rate).
 - This means that `HierarchyVATPart `and `TerritoryVATPart `can each refer to one or several categories, because I feel there should not be a need to redefine hierarchies for each product category we handle.
 - There may be a way to add `HierarchyVATPart `and `TerritoryVATPart `""at runtime"" to those hierarchies and territories that actually need it. May be by abusing the `Activated `event handler for those items.
 - `VATConfigurationPart `has also a default value for the rate: this value is used when computing prices to show at frontend whenever the selected destination territory for the products is not found in the hierarchy: for example, an EU seller would only need to define EU countries in the hierarchy, because that's where he has to apply VAT: sales outside the EU are VAT-free (on principle, excluding specific agreements with foreign countries).
 - Given that we have a destination territory, we can apply its rate for a product of a given category. If the territory does not set a rate for that category in its `TerritoryVATPart`, we look for it in its parent territory, and so on recursively until we either find one, or run out of hierarchy to climb up: in the latter case we use the default rate.

One thing to note, I think, is that this feature is only really for guidance of the people handling the finance of the ecommerce that uses it: it will do things so that when reviewing orders they can see for each product the tax due, but it should not be a replacement for an actual accountant veryfing those values.

Basically, VAT configuration based on territories/hierarchies is in place. It works roughly like this:

 - Admin creates a VAT Configuration from the Tax Admin. That is basically the ContentItem (ITax) that represents what we were discussing as TAXCategory. Each fo these items sets a default rate that will be applied for products of this category whose destination is any territory that is not configured differently below.
 - In each Hierarchy in the site, Admin can select the TAX Categories, and configure a rate for each one. These rates will be applied to all products matching the category that are sold with destination to one of the territories in the category.
 - In each Territory in a Hierarchy, where a tax category has been selected at the hierarchy level, for each of the categories selected in the hierarchy the admin may define a different rate to be applied for that territory and all of its children.

Example: a store selling Wine and Books from Italy. Exports to the UK are large enough that the store is not allowed to use the Italian VAT when exporting there, while it should use Italian VAT for the rest of the EU. No VAT should be applied to exports outside the EU.
Vat categories defined:
 - Wine, with default rate 0%
 - Book, with default rate 0%
Hierarchy defined:
 - EU (with 28 territories, one for each country in the EU). 
    - For Wine the rate is set to 22% for the whole hierarchy
    - For Books the rate is set to 4% for the whole hierarchy
    - UK (Territory): has its rate for books set to 0%. Does not set a custom rate for Wine because it is the same as the one for the rest of the EU (I am not sure this is actually the case for the real world).

From that store:
 - Selling a book has an applied VAT of 4% anywhere in the EU except the UK, where it is 0%. Outside the EU the applied VAT is 0%.
 - Selling Wine has an applied VAT of 22% everywhere in the EU, including the UK. Otside the EU the applied VAT is 0%.

For each product, there is a new part where we can select the Tax Category. The value ""Default"" matches the VAT category configured as default.

I'll add a site setting to select the ""default"" destination country: by this I mean the country that will be used to estimate VAT on products when no destination country is selected yet. This is because in the EU we are required by default to show the final product price at frontend (provided that said price is allowed to change right before finalizing the purchase, in case VAT for the destination country is different that the one used for displaying products on front end). One option available for that site setting will be to show the price before tax, for US ecommerce.",NA,https://api.github.com/repos/bleroy/Nwazet.Commerce/issues/141/comments,https://github.com/bleroy/Nwazet.Commerce/issues/141#issuecomment-383614899,https://api.github.com/repos/bleroy/Nwazet.Commerce/issues/141

The rough idea for the data right now:
```
public class TerritoryInternal {
    public virtual int Id { get; set; } //primary Key
    public virtual string GUID { get; set; } //I think we may need this to import/export
    public IEnumerable<TerritoryInternal> ParentTerritories; 
    public IEnumerable<TerritoryInternal> ChildrenTerritories;
}
```
e.g.:
Territory: Italy
ParentTerritories: EU, Europe, Schengen, EuroZone...
ChildrenTerritories: the 20 regions of Italy.

I am still trying to figure out the best Orchard/NHibernate way to implement the n-to-n parent-child relationship between regions. Should I go as far as implementing my own `ISessionConfigurationEvents` for this? I am not an expert here, and I can't see a simple way to create the n-to-n to the same table using naming conventions.

The additional properties to a Territory are also giving me pause. I mean stuff like `bool IsACountry`, `bool IsAShipmentTerritory`, `bool IsATaxTerritory`. I don't feel these properties belong in the TerritoryInternal, or in the feature enabling management of Territories at all (except maybe `IsACountry`). The shipping features should ""create"" the `IsAShipmentTerritory` flag, set to true for territories that should ""appear"" when setting up or selecting shipments. Same deal with tax features and a `IsATaxTerritory` flag.
In my head, `TerritoryInternal` currently has a `Dictionary<string, bool> AdditionalProperties` of flags, stored in a table with a foreign key to the `TerritoryInternal` it belongs to. The fact that values there are `bool` may be limiting, but I cannot think of a practical example where I would use something that is not a `bool`, except maybe to add currency information down the line.
Another way would be to simply put the additional info in the ContentItem. That makes development much easier, but also makes the structure less robust unless we do something more: I could flag ""Italy"" as a country, but not ""Italia"" or ""Italie"". We would need some way to enforce synchronization of that info even beyond what we did for culture neutral parts and fields in Orchard, and that sort of goes against how Orchard works.",NA,https://api.github.com/repos/bleroy/Nwazet.Commerce/issues/134/comments,https://github.com/bleroy/Nwazet.Commerce/issues/134#issuecomment-330153366,https://api.github.com/repos/bleroy/Nwazet.Commerce/issues/134

I disagree that territories have a global unique name. Countries do, to an extent. Territories not necessarily. The same territory will have a different name depending on localization. Some territories may ""exist"" only in an ecommerce and not in another. An Italian ecommerce is not likely to need distinctions between US states, and a US ecommerce will probably not need to make a difference between continental Italy and its islands. And some ecommerce will be special cases.
An actual example:
A guy from my hometown has moved to Sardinia and sells typical Sardinian food. He does free delivery to my hometown, and my hometown alone. He would need to have a specific Territory especially for that.

On the other hand, I agree that GUIDs are ugly.
I'd love to figure out a different way to identify a territory uniquely. One may argue that all its parent-child relationship may give a pretty accurate identification, but that honestly depends on the level of detail we get into when defining the Territories for an ecommerce instance: given European countries, and Schengen, EU, EuroZone as other territories, I think there's like 25 countries that would belong in (be children of) all three those Territories.

In the following I will write about ""TerritoryPart"", but it may work well as a TerritoryField.
I would have the Territories be ContentItems, with an attached TerritoryPart. That part would have a reference to a ""unique"" (in the sense that this information should not, I think, be replicated anywhere in a tenant, e.g. in case of localization of the Territories) TerritoryInternal record, that is actually used in the n-to-n parent-child relationships. The TerritoryPart would also contain the string for the Name of the Territory, that can be localized.
I would love for Territories as the back office user/admin sees them to have the flexibility of ContentItems, so that we may add stuff to them (like pictures). At the same time, the parent-child relationships should be kept separately and not messed with too much: they can be created/configured from back-office (with specific permissions), but I don't think they can be different across versions/localizations of a Territory.
Also, using ContentItems would mean that I could, on principle, have a ContentType for the territories I use for shipping, and a different one for the territories that affect taxes. That may look like overkill, but maybe I want to use a specific ContentType with a TerritoryPart to describe where my products come from. So a great prosecco may come from Conegliano, and using parent-child territory relationships it would also turn up for searches of wines from the province of Treviso, the region of Veneto, or Italy. If I were to design a wine ecommerce, I may directly attach the TerritoryPart to the product.

As I am typing this, I am thinking that may be calling the string in the TerritoryPart ""Name"" is sort of limiting. A territory may be identified by a ZIP code.
Let me come back to the example above of the guy in Sardinia:
He may chose to extend free shipping to Canavese. This is a region in northern Italy that has no institutional definition, and include 133 towns, across 3 provinces. Then he would need to define the Territory ""Canavese"". But Canavese is not valid for an address. He would need to define those 133 towns as Territories, mark then as children of Canavese, and then the ""free shipping"" rule would be on Canavese. In the same fashion, rather than defining the towns, he may have defined the corresponding ZIP codes as Territories (maybe some towns are small enough that they share a ZIP code, I don't know).

I don't know about storing the relations in an XML. I probably would like a sort of cache, or anyway a data structure somewhere accessible and containing the relations, so that there is no need to rebuild several layers of parent-child relationships at every request. On the other hand, as a store gets bigger and more international this structure may become a pain to maintain, and possibly cumbersome.
Thinking about the use of this, however, we may argue that we only really need to search this structure ""upward"", going from a territory through its parents until a stop condition is verified. I am thinking about shipping and taxes, and off the top of my head that would seem to be true. Also in the example of the wine shop above this could work:
Suppose I want to search for all the wines from Veneto. I could, starting from Veneto, get all its children, at all depths, and look for those, or go through my wines, get their corresponding territory and search it parents for Veneto. The second case would be an upward search in the sense I discussed above.
It would perhaps be better to have search in all directions, but I am saying that maybe, by choosing a way to have only one, we may be able to pay some performance and simplify things somewhere else. Maybe, limiting searches to a single direction may be a setting.",NA,https://api.github.com/repos/bleroy/Nwazet.Commerce/issues/134/comments,https://github.com/bleroy/Nwazet.Commerce/issues/134#issuecomment-330361643,https://api.github.com/repos/bleroy/Nwazet.Commerce/issues/134

OK, so if you have compelling reasons to make those territories content items, there are many ways the relationships could be implemented without going through the pain of implementing your own n-n relationships. For instance, territories could be taxonomies, which would strangely make sense, and already has the notion of a hierarchy built-in.

Either solution would still require to build specific logic to handle the relationships, and I feel it would make more sense to directly have a separate thing. Off the top of my head:
 - ContentPickers do not out of the box understand parent-child relationship: if I picked TerritoryA as a child of TerritoryB, I would still need to write the logic telling that TerritoryB is a parent of TerritoryA.
 - Localization of a ContentPicker either leaves selected items in the ""wrong"" culture, replaces them with those in the ""correct"" culture, or removes them straight away. Also, the localizations of a ContentPicker are not kept in synch with one another.

 - Also for the taxonomies, localization would lose us the parent-child relationships, or at least it would not guarantee that they are maintained.

Mostly it has to do with the different ""sets"" one would have to deal when talking about international shipping and taxes.
From Italy, for example, shipping to European countries, including Switzerland, often has the same rates, but for example Cyprus is different. However, considering the VAT that should be applied changes the grouping significantly, as for example Switzerland is not a member of the EU, while Cyprus is.

We could limit the groupings to ""geographical"" entities, and say Italy is in Europe, and the EU is not a Territory for this. Then we would have to go and define all shipping and taxes for each country (or select multiple countries there). I'd like it more if we had the territories already grouped, and then we would just have to define, e.g., a tax that applies to all EU countries. When the UK leaves, I would only change the EU Territory by removing a child, rather than change all taxes or shipping or other things where I had also picked the UK as a EU member.

Basically, I would pay in complexity by having the n-to-n parent-child relationships in the territories, to save back office users form having to handle groups in several places.

ContentPicker localization can be made to keep the selected contents in synch across localizations, That is what the CultureNeutral feature that is in Orchard's dev branch does. That may put enough of a constraint, perhaps. 

Regarding going to city level, I would definitely say we want that. The example of the wine ecommerce is in itself compelling enough for me to do that. I would argue, actually, that on principle we should not have a limit on how ""deep"" we want to allow the territories to go. Examples of that:
 - An ""ecommerce"" (by a pretty wide definition of the concept, admittedly) for a bike courier service in a city.
 - A local food order/delivery network, where a given physical store will handle cooking and delivery for a bunch of neighborhoods.
Of course, for situations like that we would need a way for backoffice users to setup their own Territories, because those won't care for details at the Country level.",NA,https://api.github.com/repos/bleroy/Nwazet.Commerce/issues/134/comments,https://github.com/bleroy/Nwazet.Commerce/issues/134#issuecomment-330610350,https://api.github.com/repos/bleroy/Nwazet.Commerce/issues/134

Let's say I have several ContentTypes that I use for TerritoryHierarchies. Items of each of these types have a TerritoryHierarchyPart.
I also have several ContentTypes that I use for Territories. Items of each of these types have a TerritoryPart.

An item with a TerritoryHierarchyPart will ""contain"" a hierarchy of territories, as items with a TerritoryPart, like we discussed.

I am deciding if and how to limit the choice of types for territories in a hierarchy.
There are several possibilities:
 
1. I could use a setting for the definition of the TerritoryHierarchyPart for the type.
 1.1. If no TerritoryType is set I could allow all TerritoryTypes
 1.2. Or I could make this a required setting, that if it's not set explicitly creates a TerritoryType for the HierarchyType.
 1.3. I could also allow several TerritoryTypes to be used under a single Hierarchy.
2. I could use a value in the TerritoryHierarchyPart of each ContentItem.
 2.1. If no TerritoryType is set I could allow all TerritoryTypes
 2.2. I could make this a required setting, that if it's not set explicitly creates a TerritoryType for the HierarchyItem.
 2.3. I could also allow several TerritoryTypes to be used under a single Hierarchy.
3. Both 1. and 2.
 3.1. The TypePartSetting would then be used as default, but each hierarchy would be able to override that.

In the scenarios where multiple TerritoryTypes are allowed for a hierarchy, clicking an ""Add territory"" button would present the user with a page to select the type, like it's done for contentItems.

Personally, I would set things up so that for a single HierarchyItem, it's only possible to have a single TerritoryType. I would have a setting on the typePartDefinition, used as default on the TerritoryHierarchyPart, where the user would need to actually make the choice. The Setting at the TypePartDefinition would be required, and default to creating a type. On the Editor for the TerritoryHierarchyPart I would not allow creating a TerritoryType, but I would (optionally, with a flag on the TypePartDefinition) allow choosing among a bunch of TerritoryTypes. The list of allowed types could be set on the TypePartDefinition: on the TerritoryHierarchyPart Editor the user would then be able to select from a subset of the types fomr the TypePartDefinition (because he may not be allowed to manage some of those types).

Basically, Having only the setting on the HierarchyType means:
I have the TaxHierarchy type: each item of this type will have TaxTerritories. I also have the ShippingHierarchy type: each item of this type will have ShippingTerritories.
While having the setting on the item means:
I have the Hierarchy type: some items of this type will have TaxTerritories, and some will have ShippingTerritories.

Both scenarios can work, I think. 
However I would not have different TerritoryTypes in a single HierarchyItem, because that would quickly become messy when bringing stuff to the frontend.

I'd rather not do a PR yet, because the other points are still todo, but if you have the time maybe you could review the code already? It's on https://github.com/bleroy/Nwazet.Commerce/compare/master...LaserSrl:Territories
(Note: that branch i linked should not be pulled, because it references the Orchard solution from a different folder rather than using project references)


Moving on: 

import/export:
I would have a ""Territories"" entry in Admin/ImportExport/Export, rather than have the stuff in the ""Content and Content Definition"" section. Exporting specific hierarchies will mean also exporting all the Territories in them, as well as the unique records we defined that identify those.

Localization:
Localizable hierarchy should mean localizable territories. Also, it should be impossible to hit ""new translation"" on a territory if the hierarchy does not have a different localiaztion that does not have the translation for that territory. Moreover, hitting ""new translation"" on the hierarchy should create all the localized contentitems for the territories (actually, saving the localization should do that).
I wish the localization stuff from the dev branch were already in the 1.10.x branch, so I'd be able to use cloning for this.
Either way, I'll do import/export first.

I made most changes you recommended (update to the PR will be out in a few minutes). Where I replied ""ok"" to your comments it was so that I would see that I had worked on that point.

A few things are still not finalized:

- `WishListController.AddToCart`: it uses model binding now, and verifies things about the wish list before adding the product to the cart. 
- I will add a permission provider to handle the ability to see/update wish lists. It will be based on a service (whose default implementation will be such that people can only interact with their own wishlists), allowing to implement different things (e.g. public wishlists, gift lists...). `IWishlistServices` will change to reflect not always needing the user as a parameter.
- Cart events are on a separate branch I am working on.
- Attributes being read from the form: I copied that code from the `ShoppingCartController`. It may be worth to opne a seperate issue to see if it's possible to convert that so it does no use the form, but I feel that since we cannot know what will be in the extensions, we may be out of luck here. A rewrite may be possible such that extensions have a common portion that allows identificaition, and then they process the form themselves if needed, so that we may remove it form the controller.

- I moved the methods to create those shapes to a separate `IWishListsUIServices`.

I think this also makes things cleaner, because this way when the items in a wish list are updated (add/remove) there is only one place that stores the info, rather than two that need to be kept in synch.

- The views returned by the `Index` method. This way it's easy to use placement info to only show what we want. E.g. something like this would result in in showing the detail only when ""asking"" for a specific wish list, and only the list of wish lists on the ""generic"" path to the action:

A few considerations:

- `ProductsListPart` has a `bool IsCart` property. This is of course `true` for carts. However that property is currently not used anywhere else. For wishlists, I am doing things slightly different, as I outlined in #117.
- Still regarding wishlists, I am working on a separate feature that does not depend on this one.
- Later I will need to add the events and activities we discussed that allow the creation of workflows to track the cart history. I will get on preparing a separate PR once this feature is ""finalized"".

The following settings control the behaviour of the localization:

   -  ""Remove products that do not have the correct translation."": If during the localization we find that a selected product does not have the ""right"" culture, and neither does it have a ""right"" localization, it is unselected / removed from the bundle.
   - ""Merge product quantities across localizations."": This is the slightly more complex case. Say we have a Bundle in the it-IT culture. We also have Product (in en-US) and Prodotto (its it-IT localization). In the bundle, we have selected to add 3 Products and 2 Prodotti. If this setting is not selected, after publishing the bundle will only have 2 Prodotti. If this is selected the bundle will have 5 Prodotti. Basically, selecting this causes the ""translation"" to sum all quantities across localizations of a selected product.

Using a cart in db should be an `IShoppingCartStorage` implementation.
In terms of data to store, a cart and a wishlist are pretty much the same: items, a name, the id of the owner, maybe a flag saying whether the record is a cart or a wishlist. The cart does not need a name, but I would still make the `Name` property required, and give it a default value for the cart.
The `Retrieve()` method of the interface returns the cart because it is recognizable thanks to the flag. 
The storage implementation definitely needs to access the CurrentUser, but that is in the `WorkContext` anyway.
A given user may only have 1 cart, but there is on principle no limit on the number of wishlists.

I have a `NamedProductsListRecord` that is the base for `PersistentShoppingCartPart` and `WishListPart`.
I also have the ContentTypes `ShoppingCart` and `WishList`. Those CTs are not Creatable, nor Lilstable, nor anything. The BO user can list and see Carts and WIsh Lists, but he may not edit/delete them, or really interact with them (unless there is a special permission).
When the feature is active and the customer comes to the site, we create his single `ShoppingCart` (if he does not have one already), synchronize whatever is in the localstorage cart (still need to think on how to handle all the possible cases). 
Each authenticated customer will ""have"" one and only one cart. Authenticated users may ""have"" 0 or more `WishList` items.
I still need to work a bit on the meaning of ""have"" in the previous paragraph. The authenticated user will cause those items to be created/updated from the store's frontend, by doing stuff like ""Add to cart"", ""Remove from Cart"", ""Add to withlist"", ""Create wishlist"". I'll figure out all this actions, corresponding in my head to Controller Actions, but any input is appreciated.

THe `NamedProductsListRecord` will (probably) have some properties that are ""exposed"" by the `PersistentShoppingCartPart`, some by `WishListPart`, some by both, some by neither. For example:

- `public virtual bool IsCart` tells whether the record holds a cart or a wish list. Neither part needs to ""show"" this. I only really need it in queries.
- `public virtual string Name` is the name for the wish list. The cart does not need a name. I may actually get rid of this property entirely, as it probably makes more sense to have a `TitlePart` in the `WishList` CT. Functionally, this name would be representing that same concept any way, I think.
- `public virtual string SerializedItems` Serialize list of `ShoppingCartItem`, corresponding to a `List<ShoppingCartItem>` in both parts.

Having two different parts, even though they may really represent the same kind of stuff, makes it cleaner to also have drivers/handlers to define their specialized behaviours.

Now, there is something that I am thinking that may seem odd:
I am planning to have `NamedProductsListRecord` be a `ContentPartVersionRecord`. That may seem weird, but I have been talking with the marketing people here (and they have been talking with the marketing people of our clients). They would love a ""cart history"" along the lines of ""Customer X added product Y to his cart on FirstDate and removed it on SecondDate"". Versioning the parts and the items pretty much does that for us already (as long as we also have a `string Event` in the record to save stuff like ""Added item"", ""Purchased cart""...), and makes it easier to build marketing functionalities later on.
On the other hand, if I did not have the version history of the cart, I would have to add a different record to track that information, and attach somehow to all events updating the cart. That seems needlessly complex, to be honest, even though it would have the advantage of having the definition of the record sit in the marketing feature.
I feel quite strongly in favour of the VersionRecord, because that would save me a ton of work down the line, at the (cheap) cost of making sure now that stuff like ""Add To Cart"" always generates a new version of the cart (in the scope of this feature).",NA,https://api.github.com/repos/bleroy/Nwazet.Commerce/issues/117/comments,https://github.com/bleroy/Nwazet.Commerce/issues/117#issuecomment-301041164,https://api.github.com/repos/bleroy/Nwazet.Commerce/issues/117

You lost me there.
I can see having the carts/wishlists being in the infoset of a versioned `ContentItem`, with me forcing a `DraftRequired` when things get updated. The infoset could easily contain the ""description"" of the event that caused the update (""Item added to cart"", ""Item removed from cart"", and so on...).
I can also see that having activities being ""triggered"" by what happens to the cart could be useful to provide simple ways to expand on the behaviour.
I don't get what you mean when you related those activities with the generation of reports and such. Wouldn't it be enough to go through the infosets of the different versions of the cart?

The main reason I was favoring a `ContentPartVersionRecord` over infosets is that I feel that would be faster to query and generate reports for stuff like ""All the users who added such items to their carts in this period of time and never bought them"". A User's cart history may easily become quite long and I don't know how that will affect querying over the infosets.",NA,https://api.github.com/repos/bleroy/Nwazet.Commerce/issues/117/comments,https://github.com/bleroy/Nwazet.Commerce/issues/117#issuecomment-301404744,https://api.github.com/repos/bleroy/Nwazet.Commerce/issues/117

In the ""persistent"" implementation of `IShoppingCartStorage` I am working on, I have a private `GetCart()` method, whose return value is to get the `PersistentShoppingCartPart` to use/update.
If there is an authenticated user, we can find his cart easily as they are the owner of the `ContentItem` (the `ContentType` ""ShoppingCart"" also has a `CommonPart` to track when things change, and who changes them). If there is no authenticated user, I still wish to keep track of things, so that I can down the line merge the cart history the user generated before logging in (see how Amazon handles this).
The way I would do this is to add a `NumericField : ContentField` to the ""ShoppingCart"" Type. Let's call that Field ""**AnonId**"". I would use it like that:
 - If the user is anonymous, I create and manage a ""ShoppingCart"" item, whose `CommonPart.Owner` is null, but whose ""**AnonId**"" is set to a value __anonId_ (more on this later).
 - As the user does stuff, the cart history is saved as new versions of the ""ShoppingCart"" item identified by __anonId_.
 - If the user finally logs in, in the UserEventHandler for it (I forget the correct name right now), I merge the anonymous cart history with the authenticated cart history, saved in the versions of a ""ShoppingCart"" whose `CommonPart.Owner` is the user. The anonymous history get unpublished.

Regarding __anonId_:
On principle this could be the SessionId for the current HttpContext. However, I am planning to put an `ISomethingAnonymousSomethingProvider` (with a more meaningful name), whose base abstract implementation would give that SessionId. This gives the chance to easily override this default, to make life easier for stateless clients, like Native apps could be.

There's the cart, in its primary usage, which is to persist items the customer wants to buy until checkout and it's moved into an order. Then there's the reporting scenario, which extracts data from various sources (including cart history) and mashes that up to present useful insights to the site administrators. Both are distinct scenarios that concern different users, and have different constraints. This is similar to the reason why people have a database for day-to-day operation, and OLAP data cubes for reporting.

I'd like to avoid having the design of the cart influenced by what we want to do with reporting: the reporting doesn't need the actual cart, and shouldn't depend on its implementation details (such as what tables implement it). It should only need the data.

I understand what you mean now, and can agree with it. Rather than versioning the ""ShoppingCart"" items, I will raise events and trigger activities. I would do this with something like an `ICartEventHandler`, to provide plug-in points on adding/removing items.

Re: Anonymous Id and storing carts
My concern stems from the fact that we usually deal with clients that are not web-browsers. The anonymous Id IS, as you said, a lesser session feature. Now, if the call comes from a web browser, the Anonymous ID will be the Session ID. 
However, if the calls do not come from a web-browser, I usually do not have an Http Session that persists there. In that case I would use a different implementation of the provider giving me the Anonymous ID, that allows me to exchange a token of some sort back and forth through an API layer to identify an anonymous user.
Storing the cart then for an authenticated user plays in a similar scenario, where I may add stuff to my cart using a client (e.g. a mobile app) and then use a different client to finalize things (e.g. a web browser).
Storing for anonymous users allows me to merge the cart on login, by getting whatever was added anonymously and adding it to whatever already is in the cart. Of course, the anonymous thing does not carry over between clients (e.g.: I add to cart anonymously from a mobile app, of course I will not see that when I log in on my laptop).
So far, the only thing of these carts I would actually use a record for, rather than the infoset, is the AnonymousId itself, so that when I am looking for a cart by that information I don't have to read the infoset. But I definitely could be wrong in my understanding of the relative performances there, because after all we would have to do string comparison anyway (even though the record may be indexed by the anonymousId)",NA,https://api.github.com/repos/bleroy/Nwazet.Commerce/issues/117/comments,https://github.com/bleroy/Nwazet.Commerce/issues/117#issuecomment-301700434,https://api.github.com/repos/bleroy/Nwazet.Commerce/issues/117

A thing I will probably implement today is:
Anonymous user: uses local storage and session cart.
Authenticated user: session cart is always empty. Whenever we add stuff, I put it into the persistent cart directly. This way, we only have stuff in session if they were added to the cart when not logged in, and it's really easy to safely merge carts then, without going crazy trying to figure out whether we are duplicating stuff. This way, I also don't have to handle the ""login"" event explicitly, as at the next operation/update/refresh the carts will be merged anyway.

Wishlists only apply to authenticated users

Functionalities:

 - List all my wishlists (WL)
 - Create a new WL
 - Delete a WL
 - ""Add to WL"" button in products view. Optionally with WL selection (click on a button: add to default WL; click on other part of button,: pick WL it will be added to from a list, with also ""new WL..."" selection)
 - Default WL: a user has a default WL that is created behing their back on the first ""list-worthy"" interaction (i.e.: first time we get a user's WLs, if none are found we create the default one). The default WL has a default title, possibly configurable from a site's setting. If a user has several WLs, he can pick one to be his default.

IN the ""detail"" view of a WL:

 - LIst of products. For Each product: ""add to cart"", ""move to different list"", ""remove from list""
 - button to add all the WL's products to the cart
 - Option to rename the WL
 - option to set the WL as public/private
 - option to set the WL as default

The list of a user's WLs is sorted by name, except that the default WL is always first.

From those considerations, I see some data differences compared to carts (I mean the part we are planning to use for both):
 
 - the `IsCart` boolean is `false` for WLs
 - the WL has a privacy setting: Amazon does:
    - Public: Anyone can search for and see this list
    - Shared: Only people with a link (URL) of your list can see this list
    - Private: Only you can see this list
 - the WL has a `IsDefault` flag.

To make it amazon-like, the wishlist should also have an `AutoroutePart`, that is populated to something like `wishlist/{IdString}`. This sets things up to have public/shareable wishlists. As an alternative, we should design routes so they look somewhat like that, again keeping in mind the fact that we may wish to share the links, so instead of going to a WL's autoroute, we would go to a controller's action whose route looks like that. We then woul need a specific hash or string that can be shown in the frotend for sharing purposes and that has a 1-to-1 relation with our WL. Again, this would be an additional property of a WL that is not in commonn with the carts.

There are further complexities related to attributes. Where does a user get to pick them for a product? upon adding to the list? when moving to the cart?

I'll get back here, once I analyzed the efforts the different steps take, to propose a first implementation that allows expanding and implementing everything we may want or need.",NA,https://api.github.com/repos/bleroy/Nwazet.Commerce/issues/117/comments,https://github.com/bleroy/Nwazet.Commerce/issues/117#issuecomment-303086821,https://api.github.com/repos/bleroy/Nwazet.Commerce/issues/117

I used Amazon as a reference for the features, and tried to think how to make them possible down the line as expansions on what would be implemented to begin with.

Two new `ContentType`: WishList and WishListItem.
The `ContentPart` used for the WishList type would not be the same as the one used in the cart, as it would contain a list of ids that let us get to the WishListItems it contains.
The reason for using a WIshListItem type is that it allow customizing what is in it: in the simplest case, it'll just have a ""link"" to a product. However, we may expand it by adding fields like ""Quantity I want"", ""Comments"", ""Date added"" (easy to do with a `CommonPart`), and so on and so forth.
So, in ""migration language"", I am thinking something like this:

```
//At the bare minimum, a wishlist is a named list of products belonging to a user.
ContentDefinitionManager.AlterTypeDefinition(""WishList"", cfg => cfg
                .WithPart(""CommonPart"") //for owner and such
                .WithPart(""WishListPart"") //Probably needs a different part name,or a different type name
                .WithPart(""TitlePart"") //wish list has a name
            );
ContentDefinitionManager.AlterTypeDefinition(""WishListItem"", cfg => cfg
                .WithPart(""WishListElementPart"")
            ); //other parts added in Back Office when configuring the ecommerce
```

The `WishListElementPart` would correspond to a `WishListElementPartRecord` that has:
 - The id of the ""container"" WishList
 - A single `ShoppingCartItem` (product id and selected attributes).

The `WishListPart` would have (I think all in infoset):
 - A list of the WishListElement it contains (may actually not need this thanks to the record above).
 - A `bool IsDefault`, true for the default wishlist.

I would not be implementing privacy stuff yet, if I can avoid it, but would rather leave that for a later extension feature, adding something like a `WishListPrivacyPart` and corresponding behaviour. I still wish to think more on this, because I need to make sure that privacy stuff can be ""inserted"" in the behaviours I would be implementing to begin with, which would by default be ""wishlists are all private"". It may turn out that it's easier to provide the privacy configuration already rather than allow for it to plug in.

The way amazon displays a wishlist is with a menu on the left side, showing all your wishlists, and on the right/main area there's the details of the current wishlist.
The way I would achieve this is by providing a `WishListListWidgetPart` that gives the list of your wishlists. That would ""cover"" the functionality of the left part, while giving the flexibility of putting it somewhere else. The content's list would then be coming from a controller, and displayed such that every WishListElement has its own shape, showing for example the ""summary"" of the item, alongside the buttons for ""Add to cart"", ""move to other wishlist"", ""remove from wishlist"".
The view for the controller action would then also give the ""access"" to the CRUD for wishlists, so that a user may create/edit/delete their wishlists.

`WishListListWidgetPart` would also need an alternate to have something like the ""Your Lists"" menu, with links to your lists, ""New List..."" (routes into the `WishListController`)
Routing to wishlists would go through the `WishListController` using unique strings to identify each WishList (no string to be directed to the default wishlist of the authenticated user). The easiest way to do this would be to use a GUID, stored in a property of the `WishListPart`. I can see there may be a way to uniquely identify things by using the User's Id and the WIshlists Id to generate a string in some reversible way, that I may decode in the controller to get the required info.

I would add a driver for `ProductPart` to add the ""Add to wishlist"" button to a product's view.

The considerations about the Default WishList stand as I was thinking earlier. It is created at a user's first interaction, with a default name, and the user can then interact with it as they do with any other wishlist. The way I see it, a user can never have 0 wishlists, so if they delete their last one, a new default one is created behind their back. Initially, the default WishList would be created with title `T(""Your WishList"")`, or something like that. Down the line we may want to add a site's setting to define that default title (for each language).

More features may also be added later on. For example, the wishlist may have an associated address. There are a few ways this can be done. I could have an additional property in `WishListPart` that leaves room for putting in information from `IWishListExtensionProvider` implementations (kind of like it's done for `IProductAttributeExtensionProvider`). THis way, each provider will also give us the shape to be displayed, e.g. in a WIshList's settings. Alternatively, I may have additional parts in the ""WishList"" `ContentType`, and figure out a way for those to alow configuration by a front-end user. Not having analyzed all possible cases yet, I would say that I like the providers more, but I still haven't thought about the actual interfaces yet. The providers may actually give room to implement the Privacy considerations here, as an extension.

Similarly, we may think to have `IWishListElementExtensionProvider`. I am considering this for the case where we want to add some information and have filters/searches in the UI based on that. Probably a lot of that can be done using projections/queries on different `ContentPart`, and composing a menu accordingly.

(This is all based on what I know about using alternates, which is admittedly not a lot)
Alternates as I understand them seem to be more rigid. With alternates:
- The `Nwazet.Attributes` feature uses the Index.cshtml template as the view for `AttributesAdminController`'s `Index`.
- If I activate `Nwazet.AttributeLocalizationExtension` , I somehow (using `IShapeTableProvider`?) ""enable"" an alternate. This alternate specifically is pretty much identical to the original Index.cshtml, with the exception of the ""(culture)"" notation after each attribute's DisplayText in the list.
- If another feature wants to change something else in that view, now it has to do its own alternate, accounting for the fact that `Nwazet.AttributeLocalizationExtension` may or may not be enabled. Suppose for example a `SubscriberAttributes` made-up feature adds a `BooleanField` to the `Attributes` ContentType that tells me whether that attribute can only be changed by customers belonging to a ""Subscribed"" role. Suppose that feature wants to show that in the view by writing ""(subscribers only)"" after the DisplayText. I would have a new alternate, but then this would not have the ""(culture)"" text, because that is from a separate feature.

WIth the filter, I can just say: ""if this ViewModel is there, add this script"". This is not perfect of course. I can see that if someone implemented an alternate, the script may fail to do what it's supposed to. But unless I make some significant change, I could stack MVC filters.

Controller overrides, I think, suffer from pretty much the same flexibilty limit that I see in alternates.

Did I make sense?

 - The combination of attributes in a product is not known until the product is defined/saved/published. Even in the definition of the ContentType we have no information on that. Thus, I don't see a way to meaningfully add attribute-tokens in a setting defined at the site or ContentType level, unless it's a special token that says `{Attribute tokens go here}`
 - The ""active"" attributes for a product are selected when editing the product, so that is probably the best place to add attribute-tokens to the sku. An attribute-token to me it's something like `{AttributeName}`, that should be replaced with an attribute value, or a string related to the attribute value. e.g. for a `Color` attribute, the value may be `""Blue""` but I may want, in the SKU, to add `""BL""`.
 - When saving/publishing the product, upon generating the sku, we don't know what values for each attribute to use to substitute tokens. At this stage we could generate all possible SKUs for all possible variants (attribute combinations on a  product), because in this case the sku of ProductPart becomes meaningless by itself.
 - Then we may want to query on things, looking for all products that are available in at least one variant.

Basically, where we want inventory and sku to be by-variant, I think we get:

- The Product is an abstract concept. It has attributes, and each attribute has a list of possible values. ""That shoe"" is a product, with attributes size (possible values 10, 11, 12) and color (Red, Blue, Yellow)
- The Variant is the concrete thing the customer buys. It is obtained by selecting a value for every attribute of a Product. A Yellow ""That shoe"" on size 11.
 - The inventory is associated to a variant. We have 7 Yellow ""That shoe"" on size 11.
 - The sku identifies an inventory item, hence it is unique for a variant.

I think I would in the end have an Inventory db table for that, that has:
 - SKU, computed for the specific variant
 - Quantity available
 - ID of the Product ContentItem
 - The serialized ordered int[] of the attributes involved in defining the variant
 - The serialized ordered string[] of the attribute values that end up defining the variant

I have a few points where I would like your input:

- How do we want to handle the situation where, when the feature is activated, the inventories of products with the same SKU are not the same? The idea is that the feature will cause the inventory numbers to be in synch, but to begin with they may not be. Tentatively, the path I am planning to follow is to have a notification in the backend whenever two inventories that should be the same are not, with links to edit the products in question.

- I would like to make all changes to `ProductPart.Inventory` from a service (`IProductInventoryService`?). The default implementation would give the exact behaviour that is in place right now. The implementation enabled with this feature would take care of synchronizing the inventory across same-SKU products. Does this sound ok? I feel this is better than directly changing the value in controllers/drivers, as it lets me centralize behaviours so that e.g. I can reliably fire events on inventory changes.

- I will probably like to add a way to interact with inventory from the summary admin view. Kind of like there is the ""remove one"" link right now, but ideally a text box to directly change the value (if the permissions are there). To begin with, this would probably be an additional ""add one"" link.

- I am going to add an hint near the text box for the inventory in the editor view (and maybe in the summary admin) with links to the editor view of the other products that share the same inventory. The list of products would come from the same service I mentioned above, so that in the future we can possibly change the fact that they are ""linked"" by their having the same SKU.

I add to `InventoryBySKUSiteSettingsPart` a `InventoriesAreAllInSynch` flag that is set to true when we checked all inventories and verified that they are fine.
I add a method `CheckForInventoryConflicts` that gives me the list of product groups whose inventories don't match.
If `InventoriesAreAllInSynch == false`, an `INotificationProvider` tells the back-end user there may be issues and prompts them to go to the ecommerce settings page.
At the time the feature is enabled, the flag is set to false, and `CheckForInventoryConflicts` is run once. If no conflicts are found, the flag is set to true.
In the ecommerce settings page, I have a text telling that the feature is on (this is already in the code I have). I'll add a button ""Check for inventory conflicts"" that will cause the `CheckForInventoryConflicts` method to be called and its results displayed:
- If no conflicts are found, the flag is set to true, and I display a message telling everything is good.
- I conflicts are found, the flag is set to false, and I display the list of products with inventory conflicts, with links to their edit views to fix things.

So the method will run only once at the time the feature is enabled, and then can be re-run manually whenever the store administrator wishes. Ideally, it will find no conflicts to begin with. Less ideally, it will be run once automatically, and it will be run again manually as the back-end user goes to fix things (twice here: once to find the list of issues and a second time once they are all fixed to set the flag).

I am working on that currency provider, which I like.

There are three base providers I can think of:
- Based on site's culture
- Based on site setting (I'll be implementing this as default, because it's the only one that will be providing a single fixed currency)
- Based on a customer's preference (examples by @petedavis )

A question is in the choice of provider to be used at any given time, because it does not make sense, I think, to be using more than one. 
My tentative answer is that the provider interface will have an `Enabled` property, and only one implementation will have that set to true (I'm starting to work on this configuration). 
An alternative would be a way to sort provider implementations based on their relative importance (even though I cannot think of a reason why someone would have several active providers anyway), but then we should be providing a way to customize the importance.

I see that. However, there currently is not a way in Orchard to alter a column where a default constraint is being applied (see https://github.com/OrchardCMS/Orchard/issues/7615). You cannot even drop that column.

I have an SQL script that can be run in MsSql to drop the constraints on DiscountPrice. Note that this will drop ALL DEFAULT CONSTRAINTS from the column, and it's only been tested once on my local machine so far, so there is no guarantee it will work:
```
DECLARE @sql NVARCHAR(MAX)

WHILE 1=1
BEGIN
	SELECT
		TOP 1  @sql = N'ALTER TABLE Nwazet_Commerce_ProductPartRecord DROP CONSTRAINT ['+constraints.name+N']'
	FROM
		sys.default_constraints constraints
		inner join sys.tables tabs on constraints.parent_object_id = tabs.object_id
		inner join sys.columns cols on cols.column_id = constraints.parent_column_id
	WHERE
		tabs.name = 'Nwazet_Commerce_ProductPartRecord'
		and cols.name = 'DiscountPrice'

	IF @@ROWCOUNT = 0 BREAK

	EXEC (@sql)
END
```

The main problem as I see it is that if you want to prevent the selling of out of stock products, you have to either have an approximate solution that will fail sometimes (pretty much the current situation, with some careful improvements), or you have to implement long-running transactions.

If you accept that you will sometimes sell more than is available, the process implementation can remain very simple. The worst that can happen is some additional work from your sales department on that rare occasion, as they'll have to contact the customer and find a solution.

Now if you wanted to be foolproof, you'd need to block sales on the product as soon as the available quantity is reached in any active cart, until it's cancelled or times out. That means that in some cases you'll lose a sale you could have done. There's even an attack vector where your competition can fill carts with products to make them appear out of stock, and let those carts expire, then do it again.

I would err on the side of caution, simplicity, and accidentally selling too much on rare cases. More specifically, I would implement the limitation on how much you can add to the cart (but if two customers add to their cart concurrently, we let it happen), and only decrement the stock when the sale transaction actually happens, and as part of that transaction. This is the moment when other carts would start giving warnings to their owners.

Of course, cancelling an order should also increment the stock.

If that is the case, then upgrading to .NET 4.6 before Orchard core is released against it would be very difficult / likely not advised. @jonvee could you test to see if this change would work in the StripeWebService class?

```
public class StripeWebService : IStripeWebService {
        // CHANGE - start
        public StripeWebService() {
            ServicePointManager.SecurityProtocol = SecurityProtocolType.Tls12;

It would seem like it would as it should be initiated before any web calls are made. The only real negative I see is that you are hard coding the protocol instead of taking the default which means this would need to be managed as the protocol changes. Also would cause a build issue against .NET 4.0 as the protocol isn't available...

What happens if you don't enable any shipping feature?

In the `ShoppinCartController`, the USA are treated as a special case:
in the `BuildCartShape` the following code is used to compute the shippingOptions:
```
if ((country == Country.UnitedStates && !string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(zipCode)) ||
(!String.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(country) && country != Country.UnitedStates)) {
    shape.Country = country;
    shape.ZipCode = zipCode;
    if (!shopItemsAllDigital) {
        if (!isSummary && shippingOption == null) {
            var shippingMethods = _shippingMethodProviders
                .SelectMany(p => p.GetShippingMethods())
                .ToList();
                shape.ShippingOptions =
                    ShippingService
                        .GetShippingOptions(
                            shippingMethods, productQuantities, country, zipCode, _wca).ToList();
        }
    }
}
```

For the USA, we also need a zip code, while for any other country we don't. 

This distinction is not in place in ShoppingCart.cshtml, where we always need both Country and ZipCode for any country: they need to either both be null (or empty strings) or both have values.

This doesn't seem to be causing issues if any product is not digital, as long as there are shipping options to chose from. If no shipping options are there, the customer gets the following:
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/19283945/24048248/88d0945a-0b28-11e7-9635-3b51e6c62e93.png)
This means that ShippingService.GetShippingOptions does not return null. Note that in case both `Model.Country` and `Model.ZipCode` have values, the view is like so:
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/19283945/24048709/fae09e04-0b29-11e7-8c11-8f597ea73010.png)
Because it first shows `ShippingOptions.cshtml`, and then if goes through the `Model.ShippingOption == null` branch.

I can see that for digital goods we may still need to chose a ""destination"" country, possibly for fiscal reasons.

To try and summarize, I see the following issues:
- The cart ""forces"" the customer to pick a destination country, no matter what's in the cart.
- The cart requires a zip code only for the USA while building the shape in the controller, but then it requires it for any country while processing the Razor view. This breaks things for digital products.
- Whatever goes in `Model.Country` and `Model.ZipCode` stays there, so that if a customer removes physical products form the cart after having started the checkout process he may get stuck, no matter if there are shipping options available, because the controller and the view don't treat country and zipcode strings the same way.

Should zip codes be mandatory for every country? I don't know, but I feel that handling the USA as a special case everytime is kinda ugly. I'd rather have an abstraction describing how to behave in each country, and apply that, or a default behaviour. Nevertheless the same behaviour should be in place in both controller and view, to avoid breaking things as it happens right now.
On top of that, I think there should be a different handling of the case where no shipping options are available, or even make sense.

I have an usual folder structure because I keep the non-core modules (meaning, all modules that are not form the Orchard official repo) in a different folder, that is also a different solution and a different git-repo.

Basically, since my local Nwazet.Commerce module is not in the main OrchardCMS solution, but in a different one, in the csproj I have a different path for the NuGet packages, and those that would be ProjectReferences to Orchard Modules become References to external dlls.
For the specific example, see this:

Thanks for your Feedback.
The reason I thought about avoiding publishing the products each time is avoid having rapidly increasing number of ContentItemVersion records.
I am using taxonomies and have the experience on another orchard site that having several thousand Content item Versions each having multiple referenced taxonomy terms lead to bad Performance (e. g. Publishing an items takes nearly 10s).

This is how it works in Orchard: you publish when you want to update the publicly visible version of a content item. If that's a problem and you don't want multiple versions, you can uncheck versionable in the content type definition. The only other solution I see, but I really don't recommend it, is to hack into the product part record using IRepository<ProductPartRecord> and change the inventory there directly. This is not a good solution because there are side effects to changing inventory that won't happen this way (such as updating bundles that depend on that product).

I haven't implemented the unhandled exception in order confirmation yet, but here is the code I am using in PayPal module to strip out invalid characters:

```
#!c#

public static class CommonService {
    // Resource: https://seattlesoftware.wordpress.com/2008/09/11/hexadecimal-value-0-is-an-invalid-character/
    public static string SanitizeXmlString(string xml) {
        if (xml == null) {
            return null;
        }

        System.Text.StringBuilder buffer = new System.Text.StringBuilder(xml.Length);

        foreach (char c in xml) {
            if (IsLegalXmlChar(c)) {
                buffer.Append(c);
            }
        }

        return buffer.ToString();
    }

    /// <summary>
    /// Whether a given character is allowed by XML 1.0.
    /// </summary>
    public static bool IsLegalXmlChar(int character) {
        return
        (
                character == 0x9 /* == '\t' == 9   */          ||
                character == 0xA /* == '\n' == 10  */          ||
                character == 0xD /* == '\r' == 13  */          ||
            (character >= 0x20 && character <= 0xD7FF) ||
            (character >= 0xE000 && character <= 0xFFFD) ||
            (character >= 0x10000 && character <= 0x10FFFF)
        );
    }
}
```

It is inefficient I am sure iterating over each character... don't see another way though. It does work though so that is a plus. I agree that if it can be deemed to be efficient and working it should make it's way to Nwazet.Commerce and finally to Orchard.Core. Get's me a patch I can put in place for today though.

I'd only change Xmlhelper after thoroughly checking for performance regression: this is an API that you'll see with a high frequency in profiles. But ideally, yes.

I think the most important fix would be that any unhandled exception in order confirmation code would not prevent the order from going through if payment has already been processed. This seems like the most important.

I agree, just wondering if this is something Orchard.Framework\ContentManagement\XmlHelper.cs should be doing for everyone of if this is something each module developer should concern themselves with. I have written a unit test to check for this:

```
#!c#

public class InvalidCharacters {
    public string TestString { get; set; }
}

[Test]
public void StringWithInvalidCharactersToAttribute() {
    var testStringFormat = ""test{0}string"";
    var testString = String.Format(testStringFormat, Convert.ToString((char)0x1A));
    var cleanString = String.Format(testStringFormat, """");

    var invalidCharacters = new InvalidCharacters() {
        TestString = testString
    };

    XElement el = new XElement(""data"").With(invalidCharacters)
        .ToAttr(s => s.TestString);
    var xmlString = el.ToString(SaveOptions.None);

    Assert.That(xmlString, Is.EqualTo(String.Format(""<data TestString=\""{0}\"" />"", cleanString)));
}
```

The error is thrown on this line: var xmlString = el.ToString(SaveOptions.None);

If we apply it in XmlHelper.cs then I believe we could do one check here:

```
#!c#

        public static XElement Attr<T>(this XElement el, string name, T value) {
            el.SetAttributeValue(name, ToString(value));
            return el;
        }
```

But of course, there may be other points of issue and there may also be other ways people set XML attributes so I believe I am talking myself into sanitizing it just for my module. Any final thoughts you have are appreciated.

OK, so how about sanitizing strings when they come in by just removing characters in that range, and also making sure that even if something of the same sort happens, the order correctly goes through and nothing else fails?

Unfortunately, I don't know what charset it is coming from. Here is an image of what the Orchard log shows (since you can't type arrows in BitBucket):

![Hex-Error.jpg](https://bitbucket.org/repo/Aq7xr/images/992568582-Hex-Error.jpg)

Here is how the IPN looks when viewed in a browser on PayPal website:

![Hex-Error-PayPal-IPN-Web-Browser.jpg](https://bitbucket.org/repo/Aq7xr/images/3175632282-Hex-Error-PayPal-IPN-Web-Browser.jpg)

But that same IPN when pasted into Notepad++ reveals the following:

![Hex-Error-Notepad++.jpg](https://bitbucket.org/repo/Aq7xr/images/103734258-Hex-Error-Notepad++.jpg)

And finally in plain old Notepad it shows up as the arrow:

![Hex-Error-Notepad.jpg](https://bitbucket.org/repo/Aq7xr/images/2271199941-Hex-Error-Notepad.jpg)

So I know there is something there but no way to determine exactly what it is (other than an arrow). Part of me wonders if the XML parser calls it a 0x1A simply because it doesn't know what type of character it is. I too am concerned about failing gracefully as I have workflows tied to the order and none of them went out on this Order since it didn't publish properly. I happened to see it in the error logs.

My client did and it is a legitimate order. It is only character in the street address which is coming in as an invalid character. Even though I can't paste it in here, it was a forward arrow --> (all one character) that seemingly was the issue. Here is an article: https://seattlesoftware.wordpress.com/2008/09/11/hexadecimal-value-0-is-an-invalid-character/ that relates to the type of error and parses out all of these invalid characters. What I don't know is if this is something that the XML extensions should be taking care of (i.e. in Orchard native) or if it is something that each module should take care of (i.e. Nwazet.Commerce or my PayPal module)...

I agree it is an invalid character and actually just finished trying SecurityElement.Escape, it didn't work. I am trying to set up a unit test that fails with an Invalid Character but it is hard to make an invalid character to even test. I wish PayPal would just strip them out (so I wouldn't have to try to) but then again I assume Stripe too could have invalid characters entered. Or, perhaps, this is just a one off scenario that I shouldn't even be trying to resolve. Will let you know what I find (and if you have further ideas I would love them).

As far as I can tell, SecurityElement.Escape is only dealing with angle brackets, ampersands, and quotes, so that wouldn't help at all here. As far as I can tell, 0x1A really is an invalid character.

I do this using a workflow. The module exposes a variety of events that you can use to trigger the workflow. In this case, you would use the New Order activity. Here's a screenshot of a simple order workflow that sends a confirmation email to the customer then another notification to the fulfillment team.

Sure, this is a good place to discuss, as we don't have a forum.
- product variants: I strongly dislike inheritance, and Orchard was explicitly designed avoiding the concept, preferring composition to it. We have a simple way to clone a product, which should give a similar result, without the complexity of an inheritance model.
- JS cart: sure, although you'd have to demonstrate advantages in comparison to the current implementation.
- Bootstrap 3: yes, a theme seems like the right place to do this. We don't want to impose Bootstrap.

I thought about trying to access the button clicked but I couldn't find anywhere in jQuery that allows you to get this access. You can, of course, use it if you do the validation on the actual button clicked but it is best to do the form validation on the form submission. This is why I did the little hack of manually recording which button was clicked. I would love to learn about the form no validate approach as it would be cleaner. Thanks for letting me know.

I don't see anything wrong with it. However, it might be a little more standard if you use the formnovalidate attribute on the back button and check for that on the submit event. This way if someone wants to swap out their own client-side validation framework or let the browser do it's thing it will more than likely ""just work"".

My ""simple"" fix was to add in a javascript variable:

```
#!javascript
var BackButtonClicked = false;
```

Then I added in an event handler for the back button click event:

```
#!javascript
    backButton.click(function (e) {
        BackButtonClicked = true;
    });
```

Then on the form submit event I just check to ensure it wasn't the back button that was clicked:

```
#!javascript
        if (!BackButtonClicked) {
            var validated = true,
            .........
```

and that works out great. See anything that could go wrong with that?

You're correct. It would be nice, yes, to be able to put into the cart quantities of each option of a product in one operation. Varying the weight based on attributes would be useful too.

I would however pause to ask at what point those variations become separate products.

My idea, so far, goes as follow:

I define as Variant a combination of attributes and their values. e.g. the XL (Size attribute, id 12) Red (Color attribute, id 14) ""Magnificient Shirt"" (Product, id 1023). The record for a variant has:
- ProductId: foreign key reference to ""Magnificient Shirt"" (1023)
- Attributes: serialized ordered int[] of the attributes involved in defining this variant ({12},{14})
- AttributeValues: serialized ordered string[] of the attribute values corresponding to the attributes from the Attributes field (""{2}XL,{3}Red"")
-Inventory: int for the available inventory of this product.

If a variant does not have a record, I consider its inventory to be 0.

An issue I can immediately see with this approach is that this table would grow very fast for product types that combine several attributes, and/or where an attribute has several possible values.

I think svg is better than canvas for css styling and responsive layout. But this is not main reason that i said chartjs is not best option. chartjs has some bugs specially in RTL and non English languages. It has not much capability.

Ok, I can agree that it makes sense to move away from the included and excluded areas in general, though I still love the ability to control shipping methods by country / state. For example, if someone in Europe utilizes this Free Shipping feature, checking ""International"" won't help them any as I would have set ""International"" up to be anything that is not United States. For this reason I have set up my Feature to allow the selection of:

Included Countries

Excluded Countries

Included States - Applies to United States Only

Excluded States - Applied to United States Only

This way, they are in full control of what regions of the world their shipping method targets. I can see this would be valuable on the Size Based and Weight Based shipping methods, in fact, I have a client who may absolutely need this level of control so they can set up different Size Based shipping rates based on countries of the world it is going to. 

Of course, what would be really phenomenal is if someone (not me right now) in the future would build a regions of the world taxonomy that would allow for the selection of things like ""North America"", ""Western Europe"", etc. I had to do this with a company I worked with in the past on their CRM application. The problem is that there are debates over some countries so it does get messy. I digress, but if someone reads this and wanted to tackle it, that would be a nicer way of selecting regions of the world.

Let me know what you think about updating the Size Based and Weight Based methods to handle Included Countries, Excluded Countries, Included States, Excluded States. Then I think the ""CoreShippingAreas.cs"" and ""IShippingAreaProvider"" could be pulled out completely as well as the ""IncludedShippingAreas"" and ""ExcludedShippingAreas"" columns. Look forward to your thoughts.

Yes, the included and excluded areas a a remnant of the Google Checkout era. Services such as USPS work completely differently, by inferring the applicability of shipping methods from the zip code and country. This is why no code is in place to make it work: it was the responsibility of the credit card gateway to select among the shipping methods provided. I would simplify all that and get rid of the notion, especially for a free shipping option: you should be able to get away with a simple ""international"" Boolean.
Good catch about the nullables.

I have mimicked Size-Based shipping / Weight-Based shipping. Along that line, there is an issue in Weight-Based shipping (i.e. WeightBasedShippingMethodPart.cs) on line 67 it appears it should be this:

```
#!c#
else if ((weight >= MinimumWeight || MinimumWeight == null) && (weight <= MaximumWeight || MaximumWeight == null)) {
     yield return GetOption(fixedCost + Price);
 }
```

Since both MinimumWeight and MaximumWeight are nullable, need to handle the nulls in the check.

Other than that, there seems to be a problem in both Size-Based shipping and Weight-Based shipping in that, no matter what ""Areas for which this method is valid"" or ""Areas for which this method is not valid"" you select, the shipping method is always applied (i.e. the underlying ""IncludedShippingAreas"" and ""ExcludedShippingAreas"" are not used as a filter mechanism to exclude the shipping method).

Can you confirm the above problem exists on your end? Is this what is expected of the included / excluded shipping areas? It seems that there should be a filter applied right in the ShippingService on line 27 to only include methods for where the user country / zip code is in and to exclude methods for where the user country / zip code is not in. 

Of course, this is complicated because the ""CoreShippingAreas.cs"" file only provides an ID / Name so only it would be able to tell from a given country / zip code whether or not the condition was met. If I am on the right track, could we extend IShippingAreaProvider with a method like:

bool IsInArea(string areaId, string zipCode, string country);

The expectation would be that each IShippingAreaProvider handles it's own area condition and provides confirmation whether a given zipCode and/or country exists within a given areaId.

Hope this makes sense and look forward to your thoughts.

- Server-side check so that when you add products to the cart, if you are trying to add more than however many are available, it will only add the available quantity, unless back-order is allowed.

- If you have in the cart out of stock product, the checkout buttons will not show.

Still to do: 
- verify the inventory on checkout. The complexity on this is that ICheckoutService, as it is, does not have anything enabling that check: everything is left to the implementation. e.g., For Stripe, I would change the Ship method in the controller, so it does that check and in case it fails it redirects to the cart (with a message)",NA,https://api.github.com/repos/bleroy/Nwazet.Commerce/issues/51/comments,https://github.com/bleroy/Nwazet.Commerce/issues/51#issuecomment-287053738,https://api.github.com/repos/bleroy/Nwazet.Commerce/issues/51

I've updated the Charge method of OrderPart to return an ICharge instead of a CreditCardCharge. Within the get accessor, I check if the xml document uses the previous storage method and handle that so existing data continues to work. 

```
#!c#

public ICharge Charge {
    get {
        var chargeElement = ContentDocument.Element(ChargeName);
        if (chargeElement == null) {
            // Check for legacy data structure, prior to ICharge
            var cardElement = ContentDocument.Element(CardName);
            if (cardElement == null) return null;
            return cardElement.With(new CreditCardCharge())
                .FromAttr(c => c.TransactionId)
                .FromAttr(c => c.Last4)
                .FromAttr(c => c.ExpirationMonth)
                .FromAttr(c => c.ExpirationYear)
                .Context;

        return chargeElement.With(new Charge())

Cool. That's pretty much what I've done. The stripe feature didn't need to change at all.  The persistence of the charge details on the order changed a bit, but that seems necessary since only the common interface data cab be saved and retrieved. Is that what you were thinking?

I'll clean thing up and send a PR for you to take a look at. Thanks!

If you can get it in with 100% compatibility with the current model, I'll take it in. One way to do that could be by having the credit card charge be an implementation of ICharge, that would behave exactly the way it currently does.

My concern about authentication is that I don't want us to have to reproduce a lot of what the Orchard user infrastructure already has. Single use tokens are great to protect relatively harmless resources for a short amount of time, but here we're talking about protecting highly sensitive information for a long amount of time.

The rest sounds ok, but it's a bigger refactoring than I'd have envisioned. Looking forward to reviewing the code.

I don't see a need to have users required to be authenticated to buy a subscription. This is why one of the fields above is the users email address (and optionally user id). This way it opens the door for us to send them a single use token (via email) to change the settings of their subscription. If a website implementer actually requires them to log in, he/she can check the box requiring authentication (as they can do now). We could also open the door up to allow a user to create an account after they have checked out (some sites do this) but I am not pushing for that at this time. That would make a complex topic more complex as we would have to migrate any data we want from local storage over to the database and I just don't see it as a top priority.

As for commonalities on checkout, I am envisioning two scenarios:
1. Payment gateways that have you pay off site (e.g. traditionally PayPal)
2. Payment gateways that have you pay on site (e.g. Stripe)

I would imagine the choice of Stripe / PayPal as it is now but that if you choose Credit Card (i.e. Stripe) then you are walked through this type of process (which seems fairly generic across payment gateways):
- Name / Phone
- Ship To Address (provide option of having multiple / add new ones / edit existing ones if user is logged in)
- Shipping Options
- Bill To Address (provide option of having multiple / add new ones / edit existing ones if user is logged in - option to choose same as Ship To Address)
- Payment Methods
  - This would be an interface that exposes the different payment options saved for the current user (right now credit card, future could also have bank account, etc.)
  - If the user is not logged in they would just add a card / bank account
- Review Order screen 
  - This one I feel is really important to be able to provide, not exactly sure how to do with Stripe API as it would be a screen after the credit card is entered (think it could be done as Stripe provides a token to place the approved order against)

Good point on dependency, yes, better not to rely on a library. I would only want to bring it in as code and utilize that way. Well, those are my thoughts. Look forward to hearing your ideas. If we are thinking anything similar, I can have my designer put together some concepts (I like a good visual to build off of).

I have another question: how are the screens to change information protected? Are we requiring users to be authenticated Orchard users before they can buy a subscription? If so, how do we integrate user creation to the flow?

I kept checkout in Stripe because the data required by payment gateways may be different. Not sure how you'd handle such differences. There may be commonalities, but I'd rather review this as a different feature/change set.

Apache is not an issue, as it's compatible with the license used here. The real reason why I did not integrate one of the existing libraries is that I didn't feel they were doing much. The Stripe web services are trivial to integrate, so I preferred not to take the overhead of a dependency.

Good point on open exposure of storage. Would want to let the user know information is stored with Stripe.

Yes, putting subscription on hold would be good to be supported by the interface, definitely see a user for that, whether a customer manually does it or a payment is overdue so the system automatically puts subscription on hold (rather than just terminating it).

I feel like we should have a separate Nwazet.Subscriptions feature (keep this as generic as possible). Actually, I would like to also have a separate Nwazet.Checkout feature which removes the checkout steps from the Stripe feature. It would walk you through the steps of checkout (i.e. collecting address, name, reviewing order, etc) without the dependency on Stripe (keep stripe or any other payment gateway as a feature for clearing the payment right at the end, after the user selects the payment method they desire). This new feature could also handle Address changes, credit card updates, etc with the payment providers script / api call being injected based on available payment providers / what payment provider the user chose to update. 

This would make the Stripe feature mainly a feature that exposes all of the options presented in the Stripe API in a C# / javascript way. I don't know if that is feasible or if you desire it, but that would seem the most flexible should we want to drop in other payment providers. It would also provide a consistent checkout / card management experience, only the scripts on the page are provider specific. 

There are some Stripe C# libraries out there which may save time in boosting the available features in the Stripe module. However, most are under apache license (which I don't believe we would want to incorporate into this project due to licensing issues) and the rest seem to be privately licensed. Here is an example of what I mean that is ""out there"" https://github.com/ServiceStack/Stripe/blob/master/src/Stripe/StripeGateway.cs but would not be licensed for us to utilize.

I am not yet sure on discounts, however, because of the fact that this is Orchard centric (i.e. charging every time period by Orchard, not by Stripe) we can have the amount change over time (i.e. discount) without a lot of labor in updating Stripe, just update the new table above with the new charge amount. However, the best solution is to expand our Promotions / Discount modules to have discounts that apply over time. Once we make it there, that will just be fun :)

Look forward to your thoughts, especially about Nwazet.Checkout module.

Looks good. Make sure to inform the customer where their credit card information is going to be stored, with all the relevant links.

Another possible feature could be the possibility to put a subscription on hold. Not sure how important that is, so it could be done later.

Questions: do we have separate Nwazet.Subscriptions feature, with the Stripe module being enhanced to expose the relevant interfaces? Or do we also have a new, separate Stripe.Subscriptions feature?

How would you implement discounts based on how long a user has been a subscriber?

Here are some of the items I see as being needed to make a recurring payment work (with Stripe / other payment providers)
- A checkbox indicator on a product that it is a recurring payment
  - If checked, it would expose a time period indicator of daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly
  - Side note, not sure how to handle scenarios where a different payment provider is not set up to handle the recurring payment
- If a product with a recurring payment is included in the shopping cart, then create a Stripe customer at the same time as the payment
  - This means Stripe will provide you back a Customer Id to be utilized for future charges
- At checkout, store the user email address, Orchard UserId if they are logged in, product id that was recurring, product description, recurring amount, date of first charge, date of last successful charge, date of last failed charge, and Stripe CustomerId in a new database table for future charges to be made
- Orchard Stripe Recurring Charge task would run every day to:
  - Determine what recurring charges will occur in the next XX days (triggers a workflow event - allows user to set up their own notification of upcoming payment template if they like)
  - Apply the recurring charges needed for the current day
    - If successful, trigger a success workflow event - allows user to set up their own receipt template if they like (or anything else)
    - If fails, trigger a failure workflow event - allows user to set up a ""update credit card"" template if they like (or anything else)
  - Try again to apply recurring charges that failed XX days ago (trigger same workflows as above)
    - Goal here is that the user would have updated their card information or canceled their subscription
- Other views we would need are
  - Form to cancel subscription
  - Form to change address / credit card information
  - Form to make a single payment against recurring balance (i.e. to get caught up or ahead)
  - For all of these forms, while they assume a logged in user, because we are recording email address even when no UserId is available, it opens up the door to send a unique link to the email address on record for the non-authenticated user to make modifications
- Other reports we would need are:
  - Report for user to see past payments and current balance
  - Report for user to see list of current subscriptions / recurring payments

Those are my design thoughts. Love to get feedback before implementing it.

Yes, I'd like us to remain neutral with regards to the payment gateway for anything else than the actual payment: common features can then be abstracted, and re-used. Because of the recurring nature of subscriptions, we will have to create a Stripe customer, but on the Orchard side we can make that fairly generic. It will definitely be a tricky one to implement, but I hope extremely powerful. I like the possibilities it opens of integration with CRM, reporting, etc.

I have thought about this a lot today and it seems there are two approaches:
- We integrate fully with Stripe (and any other payment gateway that comes up in the future) and have Stripe handle the subscription payments
  1. This is a heavy integration with Stripe and it is proving to be difficult to work within the Nwazet.Commere framework as there is so much to think about with different features being enabled 
     1. What happens if someone applies a discount as Stripe doesn't allow our own discount on an item, needs to be a Stripe Discount
     2. How do we handle this in the shopping cart when some items are discount and others are regular items
     3. We currently don't have stripe store the contact / credit card token anywhere so it would not be feasible for a user to return to edit their subscription (without building it out)
  2. Under this model, would need a Stripe Customer module, a Stripe Credit Card module, and a Stripe Subscription module (which would expose a Subscription part to be attached wherever the Product part is used)
- An approach I just thought of later today was to just abandon having Stripe automatically charge the card and have Orchard tasks submit the payment request on the time period desired (i.e. monthly / weekly / yearly)
  1. This puts the logic control back inside Orchard (which can be good) and makes it more adaptable to other payment providers
     1. Under this approach, the discounts / and subscription are handled by Orchard and the postings / cancelations are handled directly in Orchard
        - This means we would not need to handle setting up special subscription plans in Stripe and the amounts could be more fluid (say if you wanted to give one customer a price discount, you just type it in - Stripe would have you making a separate subscription or a discount item for that case as they don't allow for one off scenarios)
        - This means we would not need web hooks coming from Stripe (or any other payment providers) on cancelations or things changing on payment provider, events can be triggered right in Orchard
        - I don't think this would work well with PayPal though as they don't provide a token (for the credit card) to charge payments against but for Stripe it seems it can work
  2. I feel this approach would open door for better integration with other modules that could be developed (like a CRM) since the contact information / address / email is stored separate of the payment gateway
  3. Under this model, would still need a Customer module, a Stripe Credit Card module (wish it didn't have to be ""Stripe"" - possibly could be generic), and a Subscription module (which would expose a Subscription part to be attached wherever the Product part is used) but the logic would not be writing it back to Stripe, just holding it for posting of Stripe payments
     - Other nuances under this model are partial month handling or how to handle it if an Orchard Workflow fails (Stripe has built in retries)

I hope I have explained my thoughts well on the above two approaches as I really would like some ""outside"" feedback on what would seem to be the best long term solution. I love the idea of having Stripe handle it though it could end up being restrictive over time / limiting payment gateways. Look forward to your thoughts.

Thanks for the quick response. I had looked at the publish later module earlier and didn't see anything. I had not looked at the alias module, I'll dig through that to see if it offers any ideas.

Right now, the only thing I can think of is modifying the Applies method in Discount.cs to check the product's AutoroutePart if there's no HttpContext available. Something like this:

```
#!c#

if (DiscountPart.DisplayUrlResolver != null) {
    path = DiscountPart.DisplayUrlResolver(quantityProduct.Product);
}
else if(_wca.GetContext().HttpContext != null) {
    var urlHelper = new UrlHelper(_wca.GetContext().HttpContext.Request.RequestContext);
    path = urlHelper.ItemDisplayUrl(quantityProduct.Product);
}
else {
    var autoroutePart = quantityProduct.Product.ContentItem.As<Orchard.Autoroute.Models.AutoroutePart>();
    path = ""/"" + autoroutePart.Path; // Discount patterns have a leading slash
}
```

Obviously this won't hold up for products that have multiple aliases, but that's not something we're doing on this site anyway. Any thoughts on this approach?

You're right. I pushed a fix for the checkbox ids. The included and excluded areas bug is of historic origins: when this feature was first added, the only available checkout method was Google Checkout, where the selection of a shipping method was handled by Google. We just had to send them the info. Since this checkout method is no longer available, the capability has not been retrofit into Nwazet Commerce.

I looked for any usage of these to filter available ShippingOptions, But i couldn't find anything. I test this feature as the following process:
1. I added new weight-base shipping method in admin UI.
2. I checked ""World"" as included shipping area and ""Canada"" and ""All US states"" as excluded shipping area.
3. I selected ""United States"" or ""Canada"" as country in shipping form and entered zip code in these country.
4. I can see above shipping method available to select yet.
5. I think this is incorrect.
6. I think Included and Excluded Shipping Areas are not applied.

Also please be aware that label id for excluded shipping areas are same as included shipping areas and this causes UI bug.

Please tell me if i am wrong.

If it were just so that people can turn it on and off, I'd recommend to just put it into a separate feature. However, I see how having the possibility to tie custom behavior to inventory changes could be very compelling.

As far as I can tell, there's a basic behavior here that isn't going to need to be customized: if product is sold, decrement its inventory. That behavior, I think, should not depend on workflows, and should be a feature that can be turned on and off. Now we should absolutely have workflow activities for inventory changes built on top of that.

FIrst of all, there's a matter of defining when the product is actually sold. Is it on payment? What if the store takes bank tranfers, rather than credit card? The product then is sold when the payment is processed and received.
Or maybe you want to tie the decrement of the inventory to the moment you process the order and actually put the product into the hands of a delivery service. The the inventory qould change in response to an updated of order status.
Also, say we decrement the inventory because the checkout completed fine. Then the customer cancels the order. The invenotry should increase again, so we have to provide something there anyway.
Maybe again, I want to decrease the inventory temporarily before the product is even sold to prevent people from buying what you are trying to buy, and then eventually increase it back if you don't go through the checkout in a given time.
I am sure I am missing some cases.

My point is, automatic handling of the inventory is really complex. I see specific features being able to handle specific cases, however I I don't know what kind of ""coverage"" of the scenarios that would grant. I'd rather have all the blocks in place to build workflows to handle each case.

I redo all the exact steps I have written, just because my nwazet was not a direct clone but a pull request based on my local repo, and I get same result.

Here is one simple (though very useful) solution. Create a new workflow event in OrderActivity then add this in on OrderPartDriver:

```
#!c#
foreach (var item in part.Items) {
    var content = _orchardServices.ContentManager.Get(item.ProductId);
    if (content != null) {
        _workflowManager.TriggerEvent(""OrderStatusChangedProduct"", content, 
            () => new Dictionary<string, object> {
                {""Content"", content},
                {""Order"", part}
            });
    }                     
}
```

This will fire off a workflow event for each row in the order. The ""Content"" will be the product and access is still given to the ""Order"" tokens. Will be testing the effectiveness of this for a while and recommending a pull if it seems appropriate. Feedback welcome.

I'm not entirely convinced that a coupon is a discount in the sense that is used in the discount feature (which is more like promotions). It's a universal enough feature that I wouldn't be shocked if we ended up being a little ad hoc about it. I'd say go for it and add the extensibility you need. I'll be happy to review it.

Thanks for the prompt feedback. The coupon cannot be retired as it can be used by multiple users, it is only limited to a single use per user not just the first user. It is possible that is unique enough to keep isolated to a custom module (even outside current coupons module). However, the thought of tracking discounts to understand how a price was derived at / can be audited seems to make more sense globally.

I have looked at the extensibility points and they all provide me access to ""OrderPart"" which contains ""IEnumerable<CheckoutItem>"". Inside of each ""CheckoutItem"" it only records the resulting discounted price, no direct insight into the discounts used to create the price.

I realize it is complicated because the process actually chooses the most applicable discount (i.e. min price for customer) so even if I knew the discount codes that were available I would need to still determine which were used. And since my Coupons are only applicable if the user enters a coupon code, they are unique to the user.

I will play around with ""CartUpdated"" and ""NewOrder"" to see if I can extend it that way and determine utilized discounts. The more I think about it, I don't ever think this needs to make it back to Nwazet.Commerce as it is likely unique to only the case I am looking at.

Any other thoughts welcome, will close this out in a day if no other thoughts.

There should already be an event that third-party code can hook into to extend orders. Workflows can use that event, so you should be able to do the same from your code and mark the coupons as used this way. This being said, I'm not sure I understand why your discount provider can't retire the coupon at the moment it is applied. Worst case, we'd have to add an extensibility point into the checkout screens for the coupon UI.
I would definitely have a separate table for the coupons. XML just won't do: you will have querying to do.

Submitted pull request #21 for this issue.

I also reviewed the report feature (very nice btw!) for places where line adjustments were missing. The only place I found was the Export action method of the ReportController. When calculating the total for each row, the line adjustment should be added to the price x quantity. Something like this:

```
#!c#

var quantities = order.Items
        .GroupBy(item => item.ProductId)
        .Select(group => new {
            ProductId = group.Key,
            Quantity = group.Sum(item => item.Quantity),
            Total = group.Sum(item => (item.Quantity * item.Price) + item.LinePriceAdjustment) // add line adjustment here
        })
        .ToDictionary(
            item => item.ProductId,
            item => item
        );
```

I'll submit another pull request to fix that. I couldn't find a way to run the export from the UI. I had to enter the URL manually. Is there a link somewhere to download the export?

By the way, about line adjustments, I'm not using them myself on my site, so I may well have missed a few places where they should be included. Would you mind sometime doing a sort of audit of the places where line adjustments should be used but aren't? I'm thinking in particular about some of the reports I added recently.

I'd like to format the order items as a table in an html email but any markup I put in the format string is escaped when it gets rendered. 

Something like this:

```
#!html

{Order.Items.Format: <tr><td>$quantity<td><td>$product</td></tr>}

Decoding the returned string (as in the example above) allows it to work as desired.

I have a local version of this working. I'd also like to be able to use html markup in the format string so I can format order items as a table in an html email for example.

The ProductSettingsPart used to manage price tier settings. They are being saved. The problem is that the driver's Editor method is being called when other site settings are saved causing the ProductSettingsPart values to be wiped out.

I have a fix that's working. I'll submit a pull request for it shortly for you to take a look at.

No such plan, no, sorry. I'm building this module for my own needs, and I don't have much time to maintain more than one version. With 1.8 around the corner, it makes less and less sense anyway.
Your alternative is to sync your clone of the repository to the latest 1.7-compatible changeset (it's clearly labeled as such iirc).

I think I figured this out. Since I'm using infoset storage the ProductSettingsStub needs to share the same ContentItem as the site settings. Here's my updated stub:

```

        public SiteStub(bool allowOverrides, bool defineDefaults, List<PriceTier> sitePriceTiers) {
            ContentItem = new ContentItem {
                VersionRecord = new ContentItemVersionRecord {
                    ContentItemRecord = new ContentItemRecord()
                },
                ContentType = ""Site""
            };
            ContentItem.Weld(new InfosetPart());

            var settings = new ProductSettingsStub(true, false, new List<PriceTier>(), ContentItem);
            ContentItem.Weld(settings);
        }

I could use some help with my unit tests. I created a few site settings (ProductSettingsPart) that I retrieve in the PriceService like this:

```
#!c#

var productSettings = _wca.GetContext().CurrentSite.As<ProductSettingsPart>(); 
```

I need to stub these settings for the unit tests. I tried to follow your example by passing a SiteStub instance into your existing WorkContextAccessorStub constructor like so:

```
#!c#

private static readonly IWorkContextAccessor WorkContextAccessor =
            new WorkContextAccessorStub(new Dictionary<Type, object> {
                {typeof(IUser),
                    new UserStub(
                        ""Joe"",
                        ""joe@orchardproject.net"",
                        new[] {
                            ""Moderator"",
                            ""Reseller"",
                            ""Customer""})},
                {typeof(ISite), new SiteStub(true, false, new List<PriceTier>()) }
            });
```

The properties on the SiteStub are working just fine but my ProductSettingsStub properties are not being retained by the time they are used in the PriceService. I suspect it has something to do with how I'm setting up the ProductSettingsStub. The other part stubs in the project (DiscountStub for example) are all backed by records but my ProductSettingsPart is not.

Here's the relevant stub classes:

```
#!c#

 public class SiteStub : ISite, IContent {
        public SiteStub(bool allowOverrides, bool defineDefaults, List<PriceTier> sitePriceTiers) {
            ContentItem = new ContentItem {
                VersionRecord = new ContentItemVersionRecord {
                    ContentItemRecord = new ContentItemRecord()
                },
                ContentType = ""Site""
            };
            var settings = new ProductSettingsStub(true, false, new List<PriceTier>());

            PageSize = 7; // This value is retained just fine
            ContentItem.Weld(settings); // The values I set on this part's properties are lost

        }

        public ContentItem ContentItem { get; private set; }
        public string BaseUrl { get; set; }
        public string HomePage { get; set; }
        public int PageSize { get; set; }
        public string PageTitleSeparator { get { return """"; } }
        public ResourceDebugMode ResourceDebugMode { get; set; }
        public string SiteCulture { get; set; }
        public string SiteName { get; set; }
        public string SiteSalt { get; set; }
        public string SiteTimeZone { get; set; }
        public string SuperUser { get; set; }
        public int Id { get; set; }
    }

```

```
#!c#


    public class ProductSettingsStub : ProductSettingsPart {
        public ProductSettingsStub(bool allowOverrides, bool defineDefaults, List<PriceTier> sitePriceTiers) {
            ContentItem = new ContentItem {
                ContentType = ""ProductSettings""
            };

            ContentItem.Weld(this);
            ContentItem.Weld(new InfosetPart());

            AllowProductOverrides = allowOverrides;
            DefineSiteDefaults = defineDefaults;
            PriceTiers = sitePriceTiers;
        }
    }
```

Can you provide any guidance on what I'm doing wrong? When I debug the tests my ProductSettingsStub constructor is indeed setting the property values but then they are lost by the time the object get's injected into the PriceService. I'd really appreciate any advice you have.

Thanks for the feedback. I've converted the one-to-many relationship to infoset storage, implemented store-wide defaults and provided the ability to specify an absolute number or percentage. I'd like to add a few unit tests to cover the price tier calculation logic but am not sure how to use the unit tests included in the module.

This implementation won't allow for the creation of store-wide price tiers, as I was mentioning in my previous message. What I was suggesting was actually very close to what you've been doing (I suggested having a part for overriding the store-wide discount). I agree now that discounts are not the best implementation, but I still insist that you need store-wide defaults. The ""use tiered pricing"" could become ""override tiered pricing"".
I would do a few things differently however.
I would not implement a many-to-one relationship, as that data is not going to be queried anywhere. Instead, use infoset storage with a serialized form of your tiered pricing data. Less complex, and better performing.
Allow for each tier pricing to be specified either as an absolute number, or as a percentage.
Add hint text explaining that tier quantities are the minimum quantity to trigger that tier.
Cheers!

Thanks Bertrand. I experimented with this over the weekend and ran into a few challenges with the discount approach. 
- Discounts for tiered prices don't work (at least without modification) because only one discount is ever applied. This may be specific to my use-case, but I need to be able to apply a discount (ex. 10% off) to all price tiers for a product.
- If the url for a product changes the discount is no longer associated. I could try to automatically update the associated discounts but this feels awkward.
- If the (base) price of a product changes all the tier prices change as well. Again, this may only be a problem specific to my use case.

I prototyped another approach where I added a TierPriceRecord with a many-to-one relationship to the ProductPart. Then updated the ProductPart to allow users to optionally add multiple tier prices (quantity breakpoint, price). This seemed to work pretty well and allowed all the discount functionality to remain the same. The only change outside the ProductPart was a small update to the PriceService to grab the right tier price before calculating the lowest price.

Here's a screen capture of what the UI looks like:
![](http://berryweblabs.com/mockups/commerce-price-tier-ui.png)

I initially thought tier pricing would be better implemented using discounts too but after looking at it the second approach seems more straightforward. What do you think?

Yes, this is something I'm interested in. I think it should be implemented as a discount. You should be able to set-up defaults site-wide (for example, qty 10-49 gives 10%, 50-99 gives 20%, etc.), with a possibility to override per item. This means that you may have to implement a custom part in addition to the discount. Makes sense?
Thanks for offering to contribute, and let me know here if you need any help with the design.

Thanks, on my side my order controller is only dealing with order related tasks, not implyed in the checkout, I use a dedicated controller to deal with checkout tasks.....the only one is generating an unique number for new orders.
For this I am using a construct I am not satisfied with and certainly not recommended by w3c :), but gives full satisfaction at that day: before submitting to the payment platform submit, in the same click event I post an ajax call to get order number, and when ok, I push to payment the html they request.
Doing this I prevent numerous non terminated orders where the user stop before submiting...but I can't avoid orders non terminated due to abandons on payment platform.

I've been thinking about this a little more.

I'm still not sure how I can accomplish that, but there may be a way by having the controller be in the core module, but having it defer all logic to a replaceable interface. Would that work for you?

Ok, I think I found the cause. I had the Product Attributes module turned off because I didn't want customers to customize any products. When I turned the module on then it adds to the cart just fine. So in effect, we are forced to have that module turned on, which is fine if required, but perhaps it should be listed as a dependency on the main Commerce module?

Aha, I found the bloody mouse :)
On the dashboard when creating a weight base shipping methods you have to put a value on the Maximum Weight.
After doing that and overriding the shapes everything works now.

I create Weight Based Shipping Method on the dashboard and chose all destination areas availables.

I override the the shape and checked for nulls on Model.Country and Model.ZipCode, then i had another error on ShippingInfoForm.cshtml :

Operator '==' cannot be applied to operands of type 'string' and 'ClaySharp.Clay'

Description: An unhandled exception occurred during the execution of the current web request. Please review the stack trace for more information about the error and where it originated in the code. 

Exception Details: Microsoft.CSharp.RuntimeBinder.RuntimeBinderException: Operator '==' cannot be applied to operands of type 'string' and 'ClaySharp.Clay'

Source Error: 

Line 12:     <legend>@T(""In order for us to estimate your shipping costs, please let us know where your package should be sent."")</legend>
Line 13:     @Html.Label(""Country"", T(""Destination country""))
Line 14:     @Html.DropDownList(""Country"", Country.List.Select(c => new SelectListItem {
Line 15:         Text = c,
Line 16:         Selected = c == Model.Country

I override this shape as well, checking for nulls, and casting Model.Country to string, it worked with no errors, now i can select country and assign a zipcode and the values are stored in localstorage (they display on the form, and i also checked localstorage on Chrome developer tools), but it doesn´t list the shipping methods neither the shipping calculations.

Nuno.

OK, I'll try those on a new instance. In the meantime, you can override the shape in your theme and add some explicit null checks.

- Downloaded the module from bitbucket and put it in modules folder of a clean orchard instalation.
- on the dasboard i enabled nwazet.commerce, shipping, attributes, and checkout.
  *on the dashboard create a shipping provider based on weight.
- on the dasboard create a product (put a value on the weight property).

The first problem  is that when you never assign the properties Country an ZipCode to the shape unless the variables country and zipCode passes the validation of Country.UnitedStates  or Country not null, when the user goes for the cart page for the first time these are not set, so there is no way for those properties to be set on the shape.

Hi Bertrand,
I've been debugging the code and i found  a problem in ShoppingCartController.cs
in the method BuildCartShape, you are only setting on the shape the Country and ZipCode  if its not null, or if the country is United States. I Hardcoded the values on the method for testing purposes and the error disapeared, the cart form is shown, but the shippingMethods is returning 0, so i cannot see or access the shipping options.

I see that you have this working well on your website nwazet.com, what version of the module are you using there? 

Thank´s

Nuno

the data-productid is missing on mine!

I just take it from repository, latest version... on 2 different machines.
My local orchard source code and on server downloaded orchard zip and put the latest hg (staging link: http://jacopo.cms.duemetri.com/product-categories/category-2 ) 

This is what is sent to Add action first time

productattributes[0].Key=23
productattributes[0].Value=L
quantity=1

This is what is sent to Ajax (inspecting with fiddler)

items[0].AttributeIdsToValues[0].Key=23
items[0].AttributeIdsToValues[0].Value=L
items[0].ProductId=21
items[0].Quantity=1
items[1].ProductId  
items[1].Quantity=1
items[1].AttributeIdsToValues[0].Key=23
items[1].AttributeIdsToValues[0].Value=L

note that items[1].ProductId is empty...
ajax then fails with a 500 error and makes cart invalid
subsequent calls to cart fails with error 500

It does not, as far as I can tell.

Export is doing this:

```
productElement.SetAttributeValue(""id"",
                context.ContentManager.GetItemMetadata(
                context.ContentManager.Get(productQuantity.ProductId)).Identity)
```

which is the correct way to get an export identity. And import is doing the reverse operation.

Try disabling all other installed plugins and themes to see if that fixes the issue. If so, it's likely that there's a conflict between a plugin and `hyper-cat-cursor`. Use the process of elimination to find which plugin that is and remove it. 

Otherwise, it's probably best to raise this question against the [hyper-cat-cursor repository](https://github.com/balazssagi/hyper-cat-cursor).

It's also worth checking if you are running Hyper v2. In v2, they have swapped out the underlying terminal, hterm, in favour of xterm, which significantly changed the interface many plugins rely on. If that's the case, just set your update `updateChannel` to `stable` in your config file and reload Hyper.

I have two concerns, neither of which are hard blockers, but something we should consider: 

1. How do we test and maintain this long term? What if a module adds support  for stops supporting one platform? Not a blocker, but would probably want to add some documentation around this.

2. Adding indicators means extension authors may need to know if their tools work on each platform. I don't know if we want to raise the barrier-to-entry of adding to the list by _requiring_ people to test/declare support for each of these platforms. Again, not a blocker but something to consider before implementation.",NA,https://api.github.com/repos/bnb/awesome-hyper/issues/258/comments,https://github.com/bnb/awesome-hyper/issues/258#issuecomment-306045262,https://api.github.com/repos/bnb/awesome-hyper/issues/258

Most of plugins are fully compatible. Only some plugins have some OS limitation due to libs used. I think that plugin could only have better compatibility with time. It could have a temporary bug on a specific OS or a disabled feature, but most of time, compatibility will not be reduced but improved. In this case, I think that plugin author will be proud to update it in `awesome-hyper`

2. We can maybe change indicators to have 3 types for each OS: Compatible, not-compatible, untested (like non-compatible but with a interrogation point over it). If we want to do this, we need a way to have a community-driven indicator rather than plugin authors, but it will be complicated with a MarkDown. But I really think that plugin author can guess if his plugin works on different OS and accept issues on this OS. I think it will not be a barrier-to-entry for high quality plugins ;)

Some thoughts:

Plugins can declare OS dependencies in their package.json, e.g. I submitted [this PR](https://github.com/henrikdahl/hyper-statusline/pull/52/files) to hyper-statusline a little while back. It's likely not very well maintained but could be useful for auto-generating the initial info. Could also help in future to flag package changes for compatibility review. I'd suggest PR's here could point back to either issues or PR's noting/fixing/reporting compat issues for the package in question.

You could take a hard line and completely derive your compat data from that field and then just redirect folks to hound package authors to correctly declare their OS compatibility.

But it is better to not require it to reduce *barrier-to-entry*.

With my OS proposal, writing a row is hard with all these elements : name, description, OS badges and download badge. To make PR easier, I made a little tool to automatically format this row: https://awesome-hyper-linkmaker.now.sh

It takes description AND os-compatibility from NPMJS (so, from `package.json`), but user can modify them before copy/paste row.

We can maybe add a warning when user modify os-compatibility to encourage him to add/update it to its `package.json`.

I have no idea how to have feedbacks from community to keep this list up-to-date without a real website. Issues can be opened but it doesn't seems user-friendly.

Pretty much anything that changes Hyper to **help** the user, with no configuration needed, or not much.

Examples:
- [hyperterm-1password](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hyperterm-1password)
- [hyperterm-lastpass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hyperterm-lastpass)
- [hyperterm-tabs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hyperterm-tabs)
- [hyperlinks](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hyperlinks)

### Customization
Includes packages that allows the user to change Hyper's appearance and functionalities.

Examples:
- [hyperterm-visor](https://github.com/CWSpear/hyperterm-visor)
- [hyper-stylesheet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hyper-stylesheet)
- [hyperterm-overlay](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hyperterm-overlay)
- [hyperterm-transparent-bg](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hyperterm-transparent-bg)

### Fun
Packages that are not really useful, but adds a bit of entertainment in the terminal.

Examples:
- [hyper-john](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hyper-john)
- [htyt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/htyt)

As depicted by the example GIF in the README, `hypersixteen` allows you to switch between any preexisting base16 theme available with ease. There are many existing base16 themes on npm, but they're not all centralized and in one place for easy access. This package allows that.

In addition to being able to switch between an existing base16 theme, you are also able to modify any of the base16 values (00, 01, 02, etc.) with just one configuration value. Say you don't like the foreground color of `base16-ocean`? Then all you need to do is change the foreground base16 color, which is base05. No fussy `css` or `termCSS` configuration.

There's going to be hundreds of themes in a year and that will not scale if everything is listed in the main readme. That's why I suggested showing the most popular ones or the prettiest ones (very subjective though) and then more in a separate file.

Sorry to do this (you've done a lot of work), but I don't really fully understand what this code is doing. I don't know Ruby at all, so that's a big barrier to this - if it were JS or Node, I'd be able to consume it, but at this point I'm not comfortable with adding Danger because I can't read the code in a meaningful way. Additionally, it seems extremely inappropriate to be sent a GitHub API Key randomly and put it in my CI.

Thanks, but I'm going to close this and not accept further PRs on this specific topic. I don't mind running a find/replace locally if I really think it's needed. CI for basic spelling seems slightly overkill.

@bnb not really, it says

> I've written a short (one sentence) description for my package or theme of why it's awesome and deserves to be on the list.

For me it implies putting description in the README, not in pull request, I don't really understand why you want it in the description. I think that is the reason why you found yourself repeating phrase 

> Could you please add a description of why you think `...` is an awesome theme?

Although recently, you stop asking for that, so I really not sure whats what now.

It seems because of that you can't land simple doc one-liner in 10 days :/

It looks like the longest time I went without committing was from the 23rd to the 29th: [bnb/awesome-hyperterm commits](https://github.com/bnb/awesome-hyperterm/commits/master). Since the 29th, I'm really happy to say we've landed several one-liners! 

I don't ask for that on every commit by hand - if the description describes the package well enough beyond generic text, I'll accept it. Looks like that didn't happen for the `hyperterm-firewatch` theme or the `hyperterm-base16-tomorrow-dark` theme - there's a reason for those, and they're mistakes on my part.

Since I've been slightly more busy, I asked in the Zeit Community slack if anyone would be willing to assist me in maintaining `awesome-hyperterm`, where I got the suggestion of @matheuss - who has been absolutely amazingly helpful so far.

With `hyperterm-firewatch`(8444ee97decf84afa2164699fddd7147b2bc9224), I was just tired and sick, and wasn't _quite_ thinking clearly. Didn't follow the process I've set up for myself, which I needed to. My bad. 

With `hyperterm-base16-tomorrow-dark` (56b0eb012064cbfd611ce1dfb8f9c4f466dcd5e0), I'd added the really nice and helpful HyperTerm community member @matheuss to the repo as a committer without explaining everything to him - was on an airplane (and crazy jet lagged) and saw that updates needed to be made. This was when I added him, and he was going with the flow without an explanation from me. That's also my bad - should have tried to help him a bit more, or given more of an explanation.

Also, I've gone through and updated the PR template somewhat significantly in https://github.com/bnb/awesome-hyperterm/commit/04277f937bba248de3fb144f711da4759c7adb69 - please feel free open an issue and let me know if you have any further comments on it!

The README.md description is more what we're looking for. What you have is strictly a definition of the theme - it's based on another theme, adapted to terminal usage. 

What we're looking for is more along the lines of answering the question ""_Why should I click through to npm for this theme?_"" for a person looking through awesome-hyperterm. 

Personally, I've actually never heard of _Twilight_ - or, if I have, I'm not making the connection. That's not ideal for people browsing the list, as it's just noise. We want to bypass that and give them a _reason_ to click through to your theme, if that reason is personally compelling.

Has to be done manually, I'll do my best to break down the steps:

Add the upstream repo to your local fork

``` sh
git remote add upstream git@github.com:bnb/awesome-hyperterm.git
```

Sync your local fork

``` sh
git fetch upstream
git checkout <your local branch -- mine was `patch-1`>
git rebase upstream/master # there will probably merge conflicts here
```

Resolve merge conflicts and commit locally

``` sh
# edited the README.md file to include the new entry and resolve the conlfict
git add .
git rebase --continue
git commit --amend
```

Force push the change to your fork on gitub

``` sh
git push origin <your local branch -- mine was `patch-1`> -f
```

Pain in the butt but it works!

In which case you probably want hostPath to point to vanilla node.exe and use hostArguments to pass the path to babel-node.

I've been thinking about the best way to support transpilers as I've been experimenting with test262 and TypeScript again. I think it has to be a separate argument from the hosts as you will want to select your underlying runtime in addition to any transpilers. My current thinking is that eshost agents can have a transform hook, something like:

``` js
function transform(code) {
  return babelTranspile(code);
}
esh.createAgent('node', { hostPath: ' ... ' }).then(agent =>
  agent.transform = transform;
  return agent.evalScript('foo::bar(1)::baz()');
)
```

The downsides with this approach is you may want a transform pipeline (eg. multi-stage babel or minifiers or something) and you may also want to include runtime polyfills. While you could do any of this with a single transform hook, I may want to support it in a more first-class way. It's also not clear how `eshost-cli` could expose this behavior on the command line. Anyway, let me know your thoughts.

I forgot it uses `babel-register` so it already includes the runtime polyfills as well.

The transform hook would work too and in that case we can run just the `babel.transform(code, opts)` call. And your right the underlying environment/runtime could be a different version of node.

> While you could do any of this with a single transform hook

Yeah is there an issue with just putting everything it that single transform function? Sorry, I don't have much context on eshost or even much with test262 and just jumped in here haha

I want to ensure that the Flow parser can parse valid tests, and rejects tests that expect early errors.

as far as I can tell, it's not possible for the transform to know the test attributes. `agentPool.runTest` calls `evalScript` with `test.contents`, which eshost writes to a temp file, and the temp file is the only argument passed to `babel-node`.

since the agent doesn't know the test attributes, it can't tell whether the test was expecting an early error. If the Flow parser successfully parses when it isn't supposed to, I want to fail the test (e.g. replace the content with `assert(false, 'expected a parse error');`).

also, `agent.transform = ...` as proposed above would mean that the transform happens in the master process so it happens serially, right? that seems bad, I think the custom agent approach like `babel-node` is similarly flexible but parallelizes better.

Maybe setting some environment variables, like `TEST262_NEGATIVE_PHASE=early TEST262_NEGATIVE_TYPE=SyntaxError`, so that `babel-node` (or my equivalent) can handle those cases would work. But it looks like there's a remote agent which might complicate things.",NA,https://api.github.com/repos/bterlson/test262-harness/issues/58/comments,https://github.com/bterlson/test262-harness/issues/58#issuecomment-320475346,https://api.github.com/repos/bterlson/test262-harness/issues/58

This will allow you to transpile the test source code and capture failures to create a [`Result` Object](https://github.com/bterlson/eshost#result-object) to override the internal eshost agent's normal operation: https://github.com/bterlson/test262-harness#preprocessor

To create and use a `preprocessor`: 

1. Setup, install:
```
mkdir preprocessors && cd preprocessors
npm init -y
npm install @babel/core @babel/preset-env @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties @babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods --save
touch babel-preprocessor.js
```
2. Put this in babel-preprocessor.js
```js
const babel = require(""@babel/core"");
const config = {
  ""plugins"": [
    ""@babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties"",
    // ""@babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods"",
  ]
};

module.exports = function(test) {
  try {
    test.contents = babel.transform(test.contents, config).code;
  } catch (error) {
    test.result = {
      stderr: `${error.name}: ${error.message}\n`,
      stdout: '',
      error
    };
  }

  return test;
};
```

Then run: 

```
test262-harness --hostType=v8 --hostPath=`which v8` --preprocessor=""babel-preprocessor.js"" $HOME/path/to/test262/test/language/statements/class/elements/syntax/valid/*.js
```

Which will have the following result: 

```

```js
const babel = require(""@babel/core"");
const config = {
  ""plugins"": [

  } catch (error) {

      stdout: '',
      error
    };
  }

  return test;
};
```

And re-run:

This change limited the possible valid paths, but the valid options are still an extension from the possibilities before this patch. This change limits the tool from diving recursively on subfolders, unless it's explicitly flagged as a glob pattern:
- `test/built-ins/Reflect/*`: matches only the 3 `.js` files in that folder, skips the subfolders
- `test/built-ins/Reflect/**/*`: matches those 3 files + all the files from subfolders
- `test/built-ins/Reflect`: does not match any file
- `test/built-ins/Reflect/`: does not match any file

These are now only considering npm-glob patterns, assuming the path arg needs to be wrapped under quotes on *nix systems cli usage to avoid path extension.

I went with @jugglinmike's proposed solution of using Webpack to bundle what I needed into a prelude file. The webpack config and bundled file is here: https://github.com/astlaurent1/Promise.allSettled/commit/631acd603fd556ab8005165c785a64faf71f0cbb. I suppose I could have done that in my fork of test262

After doing all that, in hindsight, it would seem relatively straightforward to support something like `--webpack-prelude <prelude-entry.js>`, where `<prelude-entry.js>` imports whatever modules it needs to and runs necessary bootstrapping code. In this case, the `<prelude-entry.js>` imports the shim, then calls the `.shim()` method to make `Promise.allSettled` available in the context of the test drivers

Pre-packaging the prelude like this also serves the added benefit of  not ""polluting"" test cases with module/import semantics. The bundling provides a nice boundary between what you're preparing and what you're testing

They pass because none of the currently-implemented runners require custom definitions of `$ERROR` or `Test262Error`. Unlike `$LOG` and `$DONE`, I can't think of a case where `$ERROR` or `Test262Error` would need to be configured. Do you have any thoughts on that?

I didn't do any performance tests to find the optimal batch size for me, I've just set the number to 750 to check if there was any difference in the execution time. And the only difference was more failing tests because of stack overflows. :smile:

There is really _interesting_ code to compute hex-strings, from 15.1.3.1_A2.5_T1 (or any other encode/decodeURI test file, copy-pasted versions are present in each file...):

``` js
function decimalToHexString(n) {
  n = Number(n);
  var h = """";
  for (var i = 4; i >= 0; i--) {
    if (n >= Math.pow(16, i)) {

And later in that file

``` js
var hexB4 = decimalToHexString(indexB4); // indexB4 is in the range [0x80, 0xBF]
""%"" + hexB4.substring(3); // actually part of an expression
```

I'd like to update this to:

``` js
function decimalToPercentHexString(n) {
  n = (n & 0xff);
  var hex = ""0123456789ABCDEF"";
  return ""%"" + hex[((n >> 4) & 0xf)] + hex[(n & 0xf)]; // or charAt for ES3 support
}

So the question is whether to pit the helpers at the bottom (and depend on hoisting) or detect ""use strict"" and move it to the top?

I'd say really the ideal is for tests to not include any ""use strict"" in global scope and instead use the various strictness metadatas... I'll see how hard it is to apply this normalization.

Looks like the includes in Runner.prototype.link, l. 86 are prepended before the strict mode directive in Runner.prototype.compile, l. 47, l. 41, which makes test262-harness run all tests in sloppy mode.

```
auto generator = v::chr::alpha() | v::group_n(v::in_range(3, 7)) | v::take(20);

A couple of questions:

1. Is there any interest, once I have this cleaned up and  tested, in taking this as a contribution?

2. I am a little unsure about the following snippets of code from the implementation of outer_iterator (which follows very closely to split_view::outer_iterator with pattern replaced by length). Am I manipulating the iterators correctly in operator++?

```
    using subrange_iter_t = counted_iterator<iterator_t<Base>>;
    using value_type = subrange<subrange_iter_t, default_sentinel, subrange_kind::sized>;

    constexpr value_type operator*() const
    {
        auto iter_n = counted_iterator(current(), *parent_->length_.begin());
        auto rng = subrange{ iter_n, default_sentinel{} };
        return rng;
    }

    constexpr outer_iterator& operator++() {
        auto& cur = current();
        const auto end = __stl2::end(parent_->base_);

        index_t n = *parent_->length_.begin();
        ++(parent_->length_.begin());
        while (++cur != end and n > 0)
            --n;

        return *this;
    }
```

After this, I plan on implementing `group` which will be analogous to `group_n` but taking a predicate indicating where to break the groups rather than a count.

I can't express how valuable feedback like this is to help us get the design buttoned down for C++20. 

This reduces to:
```c++
#include <experimental/ranges/ranges>

int main() {
    namespace ranges = std::experimental::ranges;
    int a[] = {1, 7, 3, 6, 5, 2, 4, 8};
    auto r0 = ranges::view::reverse(a);
    auto is_even = [](int i) { return i % 2 == 0; };
    auto r1 = ranges::view::filter(r0, is_even);
    int sum = 0;
    for (auto i : r1) {
        sum += i;
    }
    return sum - 20;
}
```

The problem seems to be constraint recursion on the `_ConstructibleFromRange` constraint of `reverse_view`'s converting constructor. It isn't affected by removing the conversion operators from `view_interface`, but *is* corrected by applying a `_NotSameAs<reverse_view>` to the converting constructor anywhere before the `_ConstructibleFromRange` constraint. It's also notably corrected by:

@ericniebler, what do the constraints on the views' converting constructors buy us, other than potential recursion? Why do we care at all about the properties of the constructor argument beyond the fact that we can turn it into a `Rng`? 

It shouldn't be the adaptors' responsibility to enforce the lifetime model in their converting constructors; it's the responsibility of the underlying `View` type (recall that `Rng` is a `View`, despite the naming - I haven't replaced all the names yet as in the working draft). As long as the adaptors faithfully transmit the type and value category of the initializer I see no need for constraints other than that the conversion will succeed.",NA,https://api.github.com/repos/CaseyCarter/cmcstl2/issues/223/comments,https://github.com/CaseyCarter/cmcstl2/issues/223#issuecomment-446500032,https://api.github.com/repos/CaseyCarter/cmcstl2/issues/223

Well, the idea is/was to permit this:

```c++
vector<int> v;
auto r = reverse_view{v};
```

... and have that deduce `r` to be `reverse_view<view::all_t<vector<int>&>>`. But `all_t<R>` is one of:

* `decay_t<R>`
* `ref_view<remove_reference_t<R>>`
* `subrange<iterator_t<R>, sentinel_t<R>, [sized?]>`

In all cases, there is a conversion from `r` to the destination type, so I think your suggested simplification is OK.

We should try it to be sure.

EDIT: In fact, all the conversions are implicit, so I think this constructor can be dropped entirely. `reverse_view{v}` can simply deduce to `reverse_view<view::all_t<vector<int>&>>`, which is `reverse_view<ref_view<vector<int>>>` and then the following constructor Just Works:

```c++
constexpr explicit reverse_view(V r);
```

Yes, that had occurred to me. I have a mild preference for ""converting constructor template"" over ""non-template constructor with conversions in the callee"" to reduce the number of moves (as detailed in the pull request). Moves are supposed to be cheap, but not moving is cheaper. (It also has the nice side effect of localizing conversion code into the constructor that would otherwise be at each callsite when not inlining, but that's a secondary concern.)",NA,https://api.github.com/repos/CaseyCarter/cmcstl2/issues/223/comments,https://github.com/CaseyCarter/cmcstl2/issues/223#issuecomment-446728872,https://api.github.com/repos/CaseyCarter/cmcstl2/issues/223

The bug is in `filter_view::__iterator::operator--`:
```diff
 constexpr __iterator& operator--() requires BidirectionalRange<V>
 {
     do
         --current_;
-    while(__stl2::invoke(parent_->pred_.get(), *current_));
+    while(!__stl2::invoke(parent_->pred_.get(), *current_));
     return *this;
 }
```
It's searching for the previous element that *doesn't* satisfy the predicate rather than the previous element that *does*. I fixed this months ago in the Ranges proposal, and assumed it was a typo that had been introduced during all the editing work. It never occurred to me that the bug might have been copied directly from the implementation.

Most people's experience with Ranges - if any - is from using cmcstl2 on Compiler Explorer. We want them to know what a PITA it is to not be able to pass overload sets as objects, so they'll support EWG papers that enable passing overload sets as objects. And/or support a paper to promote the niebloids to function objects for C++23 if we can't get what we need through EWG.

Also I hate fun.

I'm inclined to say ""no"" until we can determine *why* this particular example has pathological compile time. All of the cmcstl2 algorithms used pure concept dispatch before there was an `if constexpr` but only 2 of the tests take literally minutes to compile. I need to minimize a perf repro to throw at Jason and Andrew so we can investigate whether this triggers something nasty in the compiler or if it's a fundamental issue with the form of the constraints. Hopefully that will let us give more useful guidance; ""don't do this with your constraints"" rather than ""don't use concept refinement"". 

> This should improve error messages for overload resolution failure as well.

Ideally, compilers should prune candidates from the overload set whose constraints subsume the constraints of another non-viable overload before reporting overload resolution failure - much like how today they prune non-viable candidates when there are viable candidates.

A word about why the `common_type` specializations are not necessary. All the view adaptors in [P0789](http://wg21.link/P0789) are implicitly convertible to Container-like things. So, a `view::transform` already has a common type with a compatible `std::vector`; namely, `std::vector`. (EDIT: @tomaszkam notes this already in his draft paper for San Diego, not linked here.) Nevertheless, it may be a good idea to add a `common_type<Range, Range>` specialization (the common type is `any_view`, which is yet to be proposed).

Also, this solution provides strong motivation for providing relational operators for ranges, which default to `ranges::equal` (for `==` and `!=`) and `ranges::lexicographical_compare` (for `<`, `>`, `<=`, and `>=`).

cc'ing @asutton and @sean-parent who have previously expressed the opinion that the ""common type"" as discussed in N3351 need only be notional, not manifest in a program. I may yet be convinced of this, but my gut says that if we are not checking it syntactically, the requirement will be ignored.

EDIT: I'll also note that once the ~~range-based relational operators and~~ `common_type` specializations are added to the proposal, the STL2 solution to this problem is _much_ shorter and easier to reason about, in addition to being faster.

Egads no. WG21 *just* got done arguing that `span` shouldn't have an equality operator that compares the elements it denotes because they are subject to change by operations that don't modify the `span`. The element values cannot be salient to the value of a range that doesn't own those elements.

You have proved that there is single compiler (as the code can be used with only 1 version) and single machine that is able to give the same speed for STL2 and cmcstl. While you are ware aware [see your's blog post](http://ericniebler.com/2014/04/27/range-comprehensions), that compiler have given very different result for such test previously.

The only reason you were seeing any slow-down at all was because your STL1 code wasn't using pointers-to-members and your STL2 code was. That is, you were comparing apples to oranges. (Compilers do a poor job of optimizing pointers-to-members, possibly because they are not that common in end-user code.)

As for that old blog post, there are some views that are difficult for some compilers to optimize; `view::join` for instance, which is used to implement `view::for_each`. On the other hand, `view::transform` is pretty easy for compilers to optimize. I wouldn't use that post to conclude that ranges are inefficient or difficult to optimize in general.

1) The code has UB, as a comparison of any_view does not match the comparison of the algorithms, i.e. the semantics requirements of StrictWeakOrdering are not satisfied.. This is important because the `any_view` is currently not proposed, so maybe not available for the user of C++20.
2) To make code shorter (compared to STL1) you are using fact that algorithms are functors (not functions), which again is not true for C++20. This may be fixed by changing the invocation to:
```

They are (disguised) function objects, so my code will work as written in C++20. (We're a little circumspect in the current draft about whether the algorithms in `std::ranges` are function objects or not, but in truth there is no other way to implement them.)

I totally disagree about this statement.
1) The code is not faster for some build setting. -O2 is reasonable and as far as I know, widely used optimization level.
2) Readability is totally subjective.
3) Mathematical notation of weak ordering allows building relation of different types (see my point 3.2) and such relation as meaningful as any other weak ordering.

Bah, humbug! Being able to pass functions to functions is fundamental and very useful. It galls me that implementors _will_ write them as objects (mark my words &lt;shakes cane&gt;), but we're not allowed to treat them as such.

For the record, I see no performance impact after lifting `ranges::lexicographical_compare` into a trivial lambda.

If the argument you are bringing to San Diego is that you should be free to write worse code because it optimizes a little better at lower optimization settings, I can tell you how that argument will go over.

Don't get me wrong. You have made some good points in your paper; in particular the unfortunate integer promotion rules and their interaction with the semantic constraints of `Relation` are a legitimate problem. Your argument about performance is not helping your case, though. You should either find a better example that substantiates your claim about performance or drop that argument. Your paper will be better for it.

But please provide a justification for this requirement in case of the weak orderings, where the objects are merely equivalent. The underlying mathematical model allows building relation over different types (the domain is just union of the objects of a different type), the definition placed in the book you are basing your work (Elements of Programming) does also not mention such requirement. From that perspective, this is only the product of your proposal.

Saying ""it is meaningless"" without pointing out any problems with it (breaking semantic models, inability to perform runtime checks, algorithm not working), is not an argument, is just opinion, that does not have support in the underlying mathematical model. This is even more evident, by the fact that you can break your semantics requirement (see your example any_view) and algorithms works without a problem - a requirement that is never used is superfluous.

The is a major difference between weak (comparators) and strong orderings (<, ==), as one of the allows an equivalent object (and things are equivalent if they from equivalence relation - there are 3 axioms required for that and nothing more), and other make objects equal (in the mathematical sense same). For the later I agree, that we should be able to point of common_type, as they are meant to represent same underlying entity, so they should have common reference (very similar case to Assingability for example).",NA,https://api.github.com/repos/CaseyCarter/cmcstl2/issues/181/comments,https://github.com/CaseyCarter/cmcstl2/pull/181#issuecomment-411287887,https://api.github.com/repos/CaseyCarter/cmcstl2/issues/181

The code to construct view looks like follows:
```
inline constexpr auto toDate = [](const Flight& f)
{
    return f.departure_date();
};

inline constexpr auto toFlightsDates = [](const Leg& l)
{
    return l.flights() | ranges::view::transform(toDate);
};

inline constexpr auto toDates = [](Itinerary& i)
{
    return ranges::view::join(i.legs() | ranges::view::transform(toFlightsDates));
};
````
Now, I am able to construct such view and iterate over it, but the invocation of `lexicographical_compare` fails, in `iter_common_reference` instatation.

Edit:
Removing all occurrences of `common_reference` helped and the code now compiles. Also, I have forgotten that `begin` is lazy for views, so the following wrapper does not work:
```[](auto const& r1, auto const& r2) { return ranges::lexicographical_compare(r1, r2); }```

And should be :
```[](auto&& r1, auto&& r2) { return ranges::lexicographical_compare(r1, r2); }```

Edit 2:
From this test I am getting the same result as from the previous example.

This is [CWG 453](https://wg21.link/cwg453), for which the current PR (and other PRs going back to 2004!) makes it valid to bind a reference to a region of memory of size-and-alignment appropriate to provide storage for the referenced type. Practically speaking, I prefer the implementation that accepts a reference to one that accepts a pointer:

1. The function is useful for implementing standard containers, and accepting references sidesteps the entire issue of how poorly specified fancy pointers are
1. Standard library implementors don't get to use `&`, and `construct_at(addressof(foo.storage), arg1, arg2)` is *way* more typing than `construct_at(foo.storage, arg1, arg2)`

Given that both of these are ""convenience for library implementor"" arguments, I suspect WG21 would reject them and ask for a design that takes a pointer parameter if someone were to propose `construct_at` for standardization.

(Fun fact: `aligned_storage` cannot be implemented in C++. Only class types can have alignments applied to them with `alignas`, but only arrays of `unsigned char` and `byte` can ""provide storage"".)

It would be nice if we could get to a place where <tt>begin(<em>range-expr</em>)</tt> returned <tt>dangling&lt;<em>iterator-type</em>&gt;</tt> if the result were potentially dangling. That is, we remove the deprecated `Rng const&` overloads of `begin()` and `end()` and replace them with generic `Rng const &&` overloads that wrap the return values in `dangling<>`. Then we can add overloads of `begin()` and `end()` for rvalue `subrange<>` and `ref_view<>` that return non-dangling iterators. The difference would be testable at compile-time. This seems to me to be more in the spirit of the design than an extra `is_referenceable_range` customization point.

It would be surprising if `Range<std::vector<int>>` wasn't satisfied so we would need to think through how the concept plays with such a scheme. It currently would work fine since `iterator_t` and `sentinel_t` test with lvalues, but we would need to make sure everything is still kosher.

It feels too ad hoc to me. The semantics of `Range` and `View` -- which are subtle to begin with -- are getting muddied by this thing in the middle. It sets my Generic Programming spidey sense tingling.

While it certainly *looks* ad-hoc - there's a concept here with effectively no requirements but an opt-in trait - I assure you this is actually principled. `ReferenceableRange` is a concept that's been around since 2014: it is a refinement of `Range` that characterizes ranges which can be passed to algorithms whose returned iterators are guaranteed not to dangle. Previously, `ReferenceableRange` - as embodied by the `safe_iterator_t` alias - only admitted lvalue reference types. This change recognizes that there are rvalue range types which satisfy the requirements of `ReferenceableRange`.

The motivation behind admitting lvalues is that (non-`const`) lvalue references will not bind to temporaries. When an algorithm accepts an lvalue reference to a range there is a reasonable expectation that the range will not be destroyed at the end of the full expression so that returned iterators remain valid. The existence of `as_lvalue` in range-v3 attests that this property is heuristic: it defends against Murphy instead of Machiavelli. A determined caller can provide an lvalue reference to a range that will be destroyed at the end of the full expression leaving returned iterators dangling, but it's not possible to do so inadvertently.

The salient feature of lvalue references that prevents their iterators dangling is that the validity of iterators (and sentinels) obtained from an lvalue-reference-to-range is not tied to the lifetime of the reference, but to the lifetime of the referenced model of range. The iterators of the lvalue-reference-to-range are exactly the iterators of the referenced range. Put simply, they have reference semantics. 

It's fairly straight-forward to see that `ref_view` has similar properties. Like an lvalue-reference-to-range, a `ref_view` can only be constructed from a `ReferenceableRange`. `ref_view` also uses the iterators (and sentinel) of the referenced range as its own iterators. Again, the validity of the obtained iterators is in no way tied to the lifetime of the `ref_view` - validity depends only on the lifetime of the underlying object referenced. (None of this should be surprising: `ref_view` is by design a `Semiregular` type that is roughly isomorphic to lvalue-reference-to-range.) Given that it has the same properties, `ref_view` provides as much guarantee as ""lvalue-reference-to-range"" that returned iterators do not dangle. It is sensible to admit `ref_view` into `ReferenceableRange`.

The story for `subrange` is similar albeit with a few twists. A `subrange` can be constructed either from a `ReferenceableRange` or from an iterator and sentinel value. Since `begin` and `end` (modulo the deprecated behavior for rvalues) require lvalue arguments, the iterator and sentinel used to construct a `subrange` either came from a `ReferenceableRange`, or have validity that does not depend on the lifetime of any external range object (as is common for pre-Ranges-TS iterators). In either case, the validity of iterators obtained from the `subrange` does not depend on the lifetime of the `subrange` - it depends on the lifetime of the `ReferenceableRange` from which the iterator used to construct the `subrange` was originally obtained. (I'm deliberately ignoring the pair converting constructor here, which I believe needs to be made `explicit`. Even absent anything to do with `ReferenceableRange`, I think converting pairs of iterators and/or sentinels to ranges should require explicit action from a user, for the same reasons that we didn't add `begin` and `end` overloads for `pair`.)

With all that said, I agree that the name `ReferenceableRange` is too vague and that its expression as a concept here is janky. It occurred to me hours after pushing this that the concept lacks syntactic distinction from `Range` and that the semantic properties will be hard to express.

That is, we remove the deprecated Rng const& overloads of begin() and end() and replace them with generic Rng const && overloads that wrap the return values in dangling<>. Then we can add overloads of begin() and end() for rvalue subrange<> and ref_view<> that return non-dangling iterators. The difference would be testable at compile-time. This seems to me to be more in the spirit of the design than an extra is_referenceable_range customization point.

I believe it is sensible for `begin` and `end` to accept `ReferenceableRange`, although I haven't given any thought to consequences. I'm less enthusiastic about `begin` and `end` returning `dangling` types for non-`ReferenceableRange` arguments: I would not want to lose the guarantee that `begin` returns an iterator and `end` a sentinel for that iterator without seeing a clear benefit.

>It would be surprising if `Range<std::vector<int>>` wasn't satisfied so we would need to think through how the concept plays with such a scheme. It currently would work fine since `iterator_t` and `sentinel_t` test with lvalues, but we would need to make sure everything is still kosher.

I think this scheme has the potential to turn nearly all `Range`s (or `View`s, if we try to restrict the effect to non-containers) into `ReferenceableRange`s: `&`-qualified `begin` and `end` are incredibly rare in the wild, and I'm not sure how we'd distinguish between the `ReferenceableRange` `subrange::begin` accepting rvalues and the non-`ReferenceableRange` `std::basic_string_view::begin` accepting rvalues.

That also occurred to me. The solution I was toying with is to change the `begin` and `end` CPOs to only look for `begin`/`end` _free_ functions via ADL when the argument is an rvalue. The onus is then on authors of `subrange`-like types to write such functions as an opt-in. It's a bit of a hack, but better (I think) than adding a new customization point.

The risk then becomes types for which users have already written `begin`/`end` ADL customization points with `&`/`const &` overloads, as that will make it appear to be ""rvalue-safe"". But for many (most?) of those types, the types of the begin and end iterators will depend on the const-ness of the arguments, making them containers and therefor not rvalue-safe.

Actually, I think we get what we want by changing the poison pill as follows:

```diff
-void begin(auto&) = delete;
+void begin(auto&&) = delete;
```

Then, after changing the CPO to only consider ADL `begin` functions for rvalues, we avoid the problem of accidental opt-in by `const&` overloads of `begin`.

If I were to do so, I would translate the Standard's requirements as (from N4659 [nullablepointer.requirements]):

> 1 A `NullablePointer` type is a pointer-like type that supports null values. A type `P` meets the requirements of `NullablePointer` if:
>
> (1.1) — `P` satisfies the requirements of `EqualityComparable`, `DefaultConstructible`, `CopyConstructible`, `CopyAssignable`, and `Destructible`,
>
> (1.2) — lvalues of type `P` are swappable (20.5.3.2),

These requirements together as a group are roughly equivalent to `Regular` from the Ranges TS. TS `EqualityComparable` requires `!=`, which Standard `EqualityComparable` does not, but that's ok because Table 28 below is about to add that requirement for `NullablePointer`. TS comparison concepts also require the result to satisfy `Boolean` which is significantly stronger than simply being contextually convertible to `bool`. I don't think this strengthening rules out many real-world models of this `NullablePointer` concept so I'll allow the strengthening and note it here.

> (1.3) — the expressions shown in Table 28 are valid and have the indicated semantics, and
>
> (1.4) — `P` satisfies all the other requirements of this subclause.
>
> 2 A value-initialized object of type `P` produces the null value of the type. The null value shall be equivalent only to itself. A default-initialized object of type `P` may have an indeterminate value. [ *Note:* Operations involving indeterminate values may cause undefined behavior. —*end note*]

This requires `P{}` to be an equality-preserving expression, and requires `P{} == P{}` to be in the domain of `==`.

> 3 An object `p` of type `P` can be contextually converted to `bool` (Clause 7). The effect shall be as if `p != nullptr` had been evaluated in place of `p`.

""Can be contextually converted to bool"" is equivalent to the expression requirement `p ? E1 : E2` where `E1` and `E2` are any expressions such that `true ? E1 : E2` is valid. I would probably pick `true` and `false` for `E1` and `E2` just for simplicity and write this as `p ? true : false`. The second sentence is a non-syntactic requirement on values of expressions that requires that `(p ? true : false) == (p != nullptr)`.

> 4 No operation which is part of the `NullablePointer` requirements shall exit via an exception.

""Shall not exit via an exception"" is notably *not* the same requirement as ""shall be `noexcept`"", so this one has no syntactic expression. We'll have to list it equivalently as an axiom of our `NullablePointer` concept.

> 5 In Table 28, `u` denotes an identifier, `t` denotes a non-const lvalue of type `P`, `a` and `b` denote values of type (possibly `const`) `P`, and `np` denotes a value of type (possibly `const`) `std::nullptr_t`.

Table 28 — `NullablePointer` requirements [nullablepointer]

| Row | Expression | Return type | Operational semantics |
| ----  | -----------  | ------------  | ------------------------  |
| 0 | `P u(np);`<br>`P u = np;` | | Postconditions: `u == nullptr` |
| 1 | `P(np)` | | Postconditions: `P(np) == nullptr` |
| 2 | `t = np` | `P&` | Postconditions: `t == nullptr` |
| 3 | `a != b` | contextually convertible to `bool` | `!(a == b)` |
| 4 | `a == np`<br>`np == a` | contextually convertible to `bool` | `a == P()` |
| 5 | `a != np`<br>`np != a` | contextually convertible to `bool` | `!(a == np)` |

Rows 0 and 1 require `Constructible<P, std::nullptr_t>` and `ConvertibleTo<std::nullptr_t, P>` along with the semantic requirement that `P{nullptr} == P{}`. Row 2 is `Assignable<P&, std::nullptr_t>`. Row 3 is the other half of TS `EqualityComparable<P>` as noted above. Row 4 and 5 together are `EqualityComparableWith<P, std::nullptr_t>` with the added semantic requirement that `P{} == nullptr` is `true`.

-Wstrict-aliasing only emits warnings when the compiler performs some optimization under the assumption that no aliasing exists.  When the compiler is not optimizing, it doesn't perform the analysis necessary to know there's an issue.

Also, thanks for the reminder. I had forgotten that the warning only manifests when optimizing, and I think I checked with debug builds, so my claim that the bug no longer reproduces is likely wrong.

> Both pass. I get it's a bug, but why does `declval` pass here, when `ss` doesn't?

I speculate the bug is the alias analysis code doing something silly that doesn't trigger with `declval<foo&>()` because there is no underlying `foo` object to analyze.

There is a regression with my change under GCC. Such a simple program fails to build under GCC now:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <armadillo>

int main()

    arma::mat33 X;
    X.fill(123);

    double y = 456;
    X = X / y;

    std::cout << X << std::endl;
}
```

GCC reports (while Clang does not have any problems):

test.cpp: In function `int main()`:
test.cpp:10:13: error: ambiguous overload for `operator=` (operand types are `arma::mat33` {aka `arma::Mat<double>::fixed<3ull, 3ull>`} and `arma::enable_if2<true, const arma::eOp<arma::Mat<double>::fixed<3ull, 3ull>, arma::eop_scalar_div_post> >::result` {aka `const arma::eOp<arma::Mat<double>::fixed<3ull, 3ull>, arma::eop_scalar_div_post>`})
`     X = X / y;`

`X / y` has type `const arma::eOp<arma::Mat<double>::fixed<3ull, 3ull>, arma::eop_scalar_div_post>`, while `X` is of type `arma::Mat<double>::fixed<3ull, 3ull>`. These are the relevant declarations I find:

```cpp
template<typename eT>
class Mat : public Base< eT, Mat<eT> >
  {
  …
  template<typename T1, typename eop_type> inline Mat&  operator=(const eOp<T1, eop_type>& X);
  …
  };

template<typename eT>
template<uword fixed_n_rows, uword fixed_n_cols> 
class Mat<eT>::fixed : public Mat<eT>
  {
  …
  using Mat<eT>::operator=;
  fixed& operator=(const fixed<fixed_n_rows, fixed_n_cols>& X);
  template<typename T1, typename eop_type> inline fixed& operator=(const eOp<T1, eop_type>& X);
  …
  };
```

Changing

```cpp
  template<typename T1, typename eop_type> inline fixed& operator=(const eOp<T1, eop_type>& X);
```

to

```cpp
  template<typename T1, typename eop_type> inline Mat& operator=(const eOp<T1, eop_type>& X);
```
solves the GCC build problem.

These allow you to test if type `T` satisfies concept `Foo`, e.g. in a `static_assert`:
```c++

The intent of Concepts TS issue 29 (http://cplusplus.github.io/concepts-ts/ts-active.html#29) is to add support for evaluating a concept directly as if it defined a constexpr bool variable/function template:
```c++
static_assert(Foo<T>());

GCC has implementation support for such usage, although it did not when cmcstl2 was first implemented.

This. Also, I haven't seen a clean solution yet for how to support such iterators in `basic_iterator`. The helpers we have are good for simple iterators, but for complicated ones, `basic_iterator` either doesn't do the job or else does so at the cost of obfuscation. Implementing these iterators from scratch wasn't much more code and is far more readable, IMO.

* Don't implement `next`, indicating that your output cursor is position-less/write-once. These iterators usually do all of their work in `write`, and do nothing on increment. `basic_iterator` will implement an output iterator that acts as its own proxy type, i.e., returns a self-reference from `operator*`, redirects assignments into the cursor's `write` member, and uses the no-requirement implementation of postfix `++` to effectively return a copy since prefix `++` has no effects. This variation is necessary to implement `ostream_iterator` and the insert iterators as specified in the TS. 

* Implement `next` and don't implement `post_increment`. This is the ""normal"" mode of `basic_iterator` operation for `Forward` iterators: prefix `++` calls `next`, postfix `++` does the typical copy-increment-return-the-copy, `operator*` returns a proxy type that dispatches to `write` and/or `read`. This variation is typically not a good fit for purely output iterators.

* Implement both `next` and `post_increment`. Prefix `++` calls `next`. Postfix `++` calls `post_increment` and wraps its return value in an iterator if it returns a cursor, or returns it directly otherwise.

Because we don't have to differentiate prefix and postfix versions of the single name `++` - we can use different names and avoid the abomination that is `(int)`. I'm not attached to the specific name `post_increment`, but I strongly dislike `next(int)`.

> And I don't yet understand why it's needed at all.

I added `post_increment` because there are a few sensible semantics for postfix increment of single-pass iterators (and some more exotic) that I wanted to be able to express:

* copy-increment-return-the-copy: `move_iterator`, `istream_iterator`
* return-a-copy: Ranges TS insert_iterators. (oops - this is fine for `front_` and `back_`, but `insert_iterator` is broken in the same way as Tom's `otext_iterator` by this semantic: returning by value from postfix `++` means that the state of the copy is updated on write and then thrown out.)
* don't care (state is outside the iterator so increment does nothing and it doesn't matter to which copy we write): `ostream_iterator`, `back_insert_iterator`, `front_insert_iterator`
* return-a-reference (state in the iterator must be updated on write): `otext_iterator`, `insert_iterator` (broken in the TS: updates to the stored iterator are lost), `ostreambuf_iterator` (also broken in the TS: updates to the value of `fail()` can be lost)
* something ridiculously fancy: `istreambuf_iterator` (return a proxy with a copy of the current element and enough state to create a new iterator!) *This* is truly the intended use case for `post_increment`: do whatever craziness you like, and have `basic_iterator` get out of the way.

The current behavior for output cursors without `next` (return-a-copy) seems to be a mistake: return-a-reference seems a better fit for the known use cases. (postfix increment for iterator adaptors that handle both input and output iterators - `common_iterator`, `counted_iterator` - really doesn't have a chance.)",NA,https://api.github.com/repos/CaseyCarter/cmcstl2/issues/60/comments,https://github.com/CaseyCarter/cmcstl2/pull/60#issuecomment-265629745,https://api.github.com/repos/CaseyCarter/cmcstl2/issues/60

This ""fix"" only works for cursors that don't implement `next()` or where `next()` has no side effects.  Output iterators with internal state and `next()` implementations with side effects must produce a proxy object for post-increment.  So, at a minimum, accepting this change would require adding a negative `cursor::Next<C>()` constraint; at which point, there is no need to dispatch to pre-increment operator++ and *this can be returned by reference directly, just as is done for the unconstrained pre-increment case.

```
constexpr basic_iterator& operator++(int) & noexcept
requires
    !cursor::Input<C>() &&
    !cursor::Next<C>() &&
    !cursor::PostIncrement<C>()
{
    return *this;
}

This suffices to implement stateful output iterators like `otext_iterator` that implicitly increment on `write()` and have no need to implement `next()` (or `post_increment()`).

I was working on a `static_vector<T, size_t Capacity>` and looking at this `static_vector::insert` overload:

```c++
CONCEPT_REQUIRES(CopyConstructible<T>{} and Swappable<T>{})
constexpr iterator insert(const_iterator position, std::initializer_list<T> il) {
    // one cannot move elements out of an `initializer_list`...
}
``` 

I can easily constrain it with two ""fundamental"" (Range TS) concepts, but range-v3 also defines Insertable-like concepts. I was wondering if I should try to use those, define my own, or just stick to the fundamental ones as long as I can. I cannot really use the concepts defined for range actions since they would turn out recursive within the containers (e.g. insert requires that insert exist and works).

After the experience with static vector I believe that constraining `std::array` should be trivial. I wonder, however, how easy it could be to constrain `std::vector`. In C++14 I would have said that we would need to constrain `Allocator`s first, but IIUC most ""troublesome"" allocator methods are deprecated in C++17, I'd guess I'll have to try.

I've also found out that for testing whether a type's non-template methods are properly constrained explicit template instantiations are great, but this has resulted in me implementing workarounds to support explicit instantiating `static_vector<const unique_ptr<int>, N>` and similar crippled types. So obviously I wonder whether doing this makes sense at all. 

Is there a trick to find out if I've properly constrained something? I don't really mind _that_ much about over-constraining things _a bit_, but I would like to catch all the under-constrained functions. 
I thought I had properly constrained `static_vector` when `static_vector<int, N>` explicitly instantiated properly just to find out that I hadn't when I tried to explicitly instantiate `static_vector<unique_ptr<int>, N>` and then have it break another two times when I tried `static_vector<const int, N>` and `static_vector<const unique_ptr<int>, N>` (and now that I wrote this I realize I might want to try instantiating it with int& and const/volatile friends just to be _really_ sure...).",NA,https://api.github.com/repos/CaseyCarter/cmcstl2/issues/54/comments,https://github.com/CaseyCarter/cmcstl2/issues/54#issuecomment-262347635,https://api.github.com/repos/CaseyCarter/cmcstl2/issues/54

IIRC `static_vector` uses a fully-initialized array of `T` as its backing store, in which case this function needs to copy assign, not copy construct. The constraint should then be `Copyable<T>{} and Swappable<T&>{}`.

> I can easily constrain it with two ""fundamental"" (Range TS) concepts, but range-v3 also defines Insertable-like concepts.

I would be leery of anything not defined in the TS: there are a lot of ""ad hoc"" concepts in range-v3 that are syntax without well-documented semantic constraints. 

> I wonder, however, how easy it could be to constrain `std::vector`

I have an archive lying around somewhere from a few days I spent trying to constrain `vector` and `forward_list` while respecting the allocator completeness requirements in the C++17 WP. It's messy. Consider that e.g. allocator-aware containers never directly construct or destroy objects of their element types: they only do so indirectly through their allocator.

> Is there a trick to find out if I've properly constrained something?

The best we can do right now is to test with parameter types specially engineered to meet only the minimal requirements.

That's an optimization for when `std::is_trivial<T>{} == true`. When it is false it uses `std::aligned_storage` and constructs the elements using placement new on it using the copy constructor. I guess that the constraints don't say that if `T` is trivial, then copy assignment will happen, but if `T` is trivial, it is always `Copyable`. EDIT: maybe something like `(CopyConstructible<T>{} and Swappable<T&>{}) or std::is_trivial<T>{}` would make it more clear, but if `T` is trivial the condition left of the `or` is always true anyways.

This is what I thought as well, and what seems true in C++14. In C++17 `Allocator::construct` and `Allocator::destroy` (and `Allocator::adressof`) are deprecated, and there doesn't seem to be any replacement. I thought this meant that C++17 allocators only allocate and free raw memory, and that in C++17 it is the container's job to manage object construction and destruction. This would actually simplify constraining vector, since it can define its own `construct` / `destroy` functions that it can properly constrain.

More precisely, allocator-aware containers are required to use `allocator_traits<Allocator>` as an intermediary instead of interacting directly with allocators. The deprecated members of `std::allocator` are no longer needed since they are equivalent to the default implementations of those members in `std::allocator_traits`.

Yes, I didn't mean generally so much as ""for the cases that are not already broken."" IIRC `istreambuf_iterator` uses the `basic_iterator` postincrement proxy support; it will be more broken if we simply yank things out.

> EDIT: so maybe `istream_iterator istream_iterator::operator++(int) requires Movable<T>();`. Or `void istream_iterator::operator++(int);`

My `istream_iterator` currently requires:

``` c++
DefaultConstructible<T>() // We can't ""istream >> t;"" without creating a T somehow
&& CopyConstructible<T>() // Copying iterators requires copying T
&& StreamExtractable<T, std::basic_istream<charT, traits>> // requires istream >> t

I'm trying to eliminate undocumented discrepancies between cmcstl2 and D0459R1. If e.g. `back_inserter` doesn't meet the specification in D0459R1 because we gutted its post-increment operator, there must be a comment that summarizes the discrepancies and a link to the github issue discussing those discrepancies.

Now that I have, the test is still broken. The issue is that `_counted_iterator::cursor` has a non-template member `read`:

``` c++
decltype(auto) read() const
  noexcept(noexcept(*declval<const I&>()))
  requires InputIterator<I>();
```

Despite the associated constraints (`InputIterator<I>()`) not being satisfied, the compiler is substituting into the `noexcept` clause. I reported a similar bug (https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=69096) back in December, in which return type deduction was being performed before checking constraint satisfaction. This could be the same bug.

It's not significant whether or not a user-defined address operator is `constexpr`, the point is to avoid calling user-defined address operators altogether.

`std::addressof` can't be portably implemented as `constexpr` since it needs to use `reinterpret_cast`; `ranges::addressof` is `constexpr` when used with types that don't overload `&`. (It is when `STL2_CONSTEXPR_EXT` is defined to `constexpr`, that is. The constexpr-ness of `ranges::__addressof::impl` is independent of compilation modes.)

None of this mess pertains to types which are required to satisfy any of the object concepts, since `Destructible` sensibly forbids `&` to return anything other than the address of the object. We can simply use `&` on them directly and avoid `addressof` and its `constexpr` issues.

The entire purpose of `std::addressof` is to get the address of an object regardless of whether it defines an address operator. It can be portably implemented as:

``` c++
// Add T's cv-qualifiers to U
template <class T, class U>
struct __xref { using type = U; };
template <class T, class U>
struct __xref<const T> { using type = const U; };
template <class T, class U>
struct __xref<volatile T> { using type = volatile U; };
template <class T, class U>
struct __xref<const volatile T> { using type = const volatile U; };

template <class T>
T* addressof(T& t) noexcept {
  return static_cast<T*>(static_cast<__xref<T,void>*>(
    &reinterpret_cast<__xref<T,char>&>(t)));
}
```

If you _want_ to call user-defined address operators, you use `&` instead of `addressof`.

> The way it is right now, if variant is made constexpr, and it store types with a constexpr addressof operator, constexpr get wouldn't work because it would attempt to use `std::addressof`.

Whose variant? range-v3's? My (somewhat sloppy and rushed) variant is as constexpr as I believe is possible - heck, I have constexpr variadic perfect-forwarding `visit` - and nowhere in the implementation does it take the address of an element with either `&` or `addressof`.

So this is more likely a difference between my development environment and yours than a bug in the compiler.

I used 256 in the `temporary_vector` test because it's the largest alignment supported by g++ in my development environment, not because anything in the library needs an alignment that large.

A single-pass algorithm cares about two positions: ""current"" and ""end"". It would be pointless to compare ""current"" with itself. It seems silly to me to require input and output iterators to implement `==` when nothing will ever use it. Conversely, `common_iterator<WeakInputIterator, WeakSentinel>` take advantage of that fact to model STL1 `InputIterator` for backwards-compatibility.

I can imagine 10 years from now having to explain to people that `operator==` is useless but they have to implement it because we wanted `InputIterator` and `OutputIterator` to look like their big brother concepts. I understand that it's nice to have things model `Regular` when possible, but `operator==` for what are really weak iterators is a minefield for programming errors: it's useless when used correctly, and UB when used incorrectly. In the near future compilers will tell us we can't compare `WeakIterator`s, but it will be quite a while before we can describe the semantics of `InputIterator` to the degree necessary for a compiler to diagnose `auto tmp = i++; tmp == i;`.

I think we'd be doing future C++ programmers a service if we:
- Eliminate `InputIterator` and `OutputIterator`
- Push the `Iterator` requirements up into `ForwardIterator`
- Weaken `Sentinel`
- Strip the `Weak` prefix from `WeakIterator` / `WeakInputIterator` / `WeakOutputIterator`

resulting in a smaller overall body of concepts without ""boilerplate"" constraints. (Some of this is speculative, I haven't done the legwork yet to be certain all the above are possible without breaking something in the design.)

``` c++
requires (T (&t)(), U (&u)()) {

which works as intended with `void` for `T` and `U`. (`CommonReference` also needs some occurrences of `T&` replaced by `add_lvalue_reference_t<T>`.)

Same here on a 32GB drive. Bummed. This is a really cool idea.

Tried a 32GB and 128GB card, in both cases, I am unable to partition this properly by letting the script do what it should. I have tried multiple values for campercent, 60%, 80%, 90% and 100% without success. This is a showstopper for me as the Teslacam partition is unusable.

Note: I'm on 2019.8.3 and I am **not** having the issue, although I fully expected to when I updated last week.

I found this as well.  therealmarcone has a PR up with corrections to use /dev/loop passed to fsck and it works well on my setup and 2019.8.4 so far.  With just the new partitioning, fsck would fail to run which meant that after the first dirty power off, you'd lose access to the cam/music drives on the car.

I've been using TeslaUsb successfully since December.   I made @marcone's changes to update to using a partitioned drive with FAT file system.

On the Model 3, everything's working great.

The X hasn't worked for a couple of months; I spent some time today to figure out what's wrong with the X.  On the Model X, it appears that the X is cutting power to the USB port every 35 seconds or so, causing the PI to reboot every time, obviously.   I've tried both my Pi's on each car.  Both Pi's work fine in the Model 3, neither of them work in the Model X.

The Model X has white lights around the USB port.  If I watch the light after plugging in the Pi, the light around the USB port flashes off and on at 35 seconds after I plug in the PI directly to the port.

My guess is that the MCU is interrogating the port to try to find a  file system, and it's taking the PI too long to boot up and present the Music / CAM drives before the MCU gives up and powercycles the port.  This appears to be new behavior in 2019.8.x   I have no idea why the behavior is different between the X and the 3, but it definitely is.   My X is relatively new (Aug 2018 build), so I assume it has the latest available hardware revision of the MCU.

I don't see anything. The process I used to set up my Pi is non-standard. Here is what I am doing:

1. Start with a clean install of Raspbian Stretch Lite
2. Install nginx, php-fpm and php-mbstring
3. Install and configure rclone, download my website scripts, verify that my website is running
4. Change `/etc/rc.local` to do a filesystem check, run modprobe and prepare some temp files for PHP and nginx to run properly:
```

log ""Starting nginx...""
/usr/sbin/service nginx start >> ""$LOGFILE"" 2>&1

exit 0
```
5. Download setup-teslausb from this repository, export shell variables `RCLONE_ENABLE`, `RCLONE_DRIVE`, `RCLONE_PATH` and `campercent` and run the setup script 
6. Reboot

This process used to work perfectly before 2019.5.x. Now with a newly formatted Micro SD card, I ran all these steps. It ran fine with no error messages at all. 

The log files I do see now are the ones for my nginx server and they are working just fine. The rc.local log file in /tmp looks normal as well:
```
pi@dpi:~ $ cat /tmp/rc.local.log 
Thu Nov  3 10:17:04 PDT 2016: Running fsck...
fsck from util-linux 2.29.2

Thu Nov  3 10:17:07 PDT 2016: Starting nginx...
Thu Nov  3 10:17:10 PDT 2016: All done
```

Now when I plug my Pi0W into my Windows 10 computer, even the computer is **not** showing the CAM and MUSIC drives. Those drives showed up fine on the computer the first time it rebooted (after step 5 above), before I tried the Pi0W (without success) in the car with 2019.5.3.

To try to see what's going on, I tried running `sudo modprobe g_mass_storage` over SSH. It ran without any error messages, but still no drives show up on the computer. After that, if I do `mount /mnt/cam` on the Pi, I can `cd /mnt/cam` and `ls` to see that there is a directory called TeslaCam in there. It is empty. `umount /mnt/cam` works without producing any error messages either, as does `sudo modprobe -r g_mass_storage`. 

As far as I can tell, the contents of `/etc/modprobe.d/g_mass_storage.conf` look good:
```
pi@dpi:~ $ cat /etc/modprobe.d/g_mass_storage.conf
options g_mass_storage file=/backingfiles/music_disk.bin,/backingfiles/cam_disk.bin removable=1,1 ro=0,0 stall=0 iSerialNumber=123456
```
 and `df -H` shows mutable and backingfiles with space allocated to them:
```

The problem seems to be caused by the filesystem image itself though, because when I used 'dd' to make a copy of an existing working sd card and then copied that onto the Pi in place of /backingfiles/cam_disk.bin, it worked again.

While playing with this I also noticed some peculiar behavior with Windows 10:
- right click and eject the music and cam drives
- unplug the pi (I have it on a battery, so it stays powered)
- plug it back in
- Windows will show the drives, but will show them as unformatted / unknown filesystem
- ssh into the pi, ""modprobe -r g_mass_storage"", the drives will disappear from Windows
- ""modprobe g_mass_storage"", and the drives will reappear, this time correctly as music/cam drives
- repeat from step 1

Not sure if it behaved like this before, but I had to this once while it was connected to the car as well, before it would see the drives.

In other words, if you simply
`fallocate -l 16777216K cam_disk.bin` and then `mkfs.vfat cam_disk.bin -F 32 -n CAM` like the setup scripts do, it won't work.
Instead you have to partition the image, then format the partition. At least that's what worked for me. Here's what I did:
- fallocate -l 16777216K cam_disk.bin
- fdisk cam_disk.bin
- create new primary partition: n, p, \<enter>, \<enter>, \<enter>
- set partition type to 'W95 FAT32 (LBA)': t, c, \<enter>
- write partition table: w, \<enter>
- quit fdisk: q, \<enter>

Verify you have a partitioned image with ""fdisk -l cam_disk.bin"", it should show something like:
```
Device             Boot Start      End  Sectors Size Id Type
cam_disk.bin1            2048 33554431 33552384  16G  c W95 FAT32 (LBA)
```
Now since mkfs can only deal with whole devices, you'll need to loopback-mount the partition you just created, so you can create a filesystem on it:

- losetup -o 1048576 loop0 /backingfiles/cam_disk.bin

(the number will vary based on how you partitioned the image file. In my case the partition started at sector 2048, so the offset is 2048*512=1048576)

Create the filesystem and teslacam folder:

- mkfs.vfat /dev/loop0 -F 32 -n CAM
- mount /dev/loop0 /mnt/cam
- mkdir /mnt/cam/TeslaCam
- umount /mnt/cam/
- losetup -d /dev/loop0

Now when you export the image as usb storage, the Tesla will recognize it properly.
For some reason this isn't necessary for the music disk.

Note that the cam_disk.bin image created this way will need to be mounted with the correct offset for the partition, so /etc/fstab needs to be updated to reflect that. In the above example, adding ""offset=1048576"" to the list of mount options should do the trick",NA,https://api.github.com/repos/cimryan/teslausb/issues/119/comments,https://github.com/cimryan/teslausb/issues/119#issuecomment-471342299,https://api.github.com/repos/cimryan/teslausb/issues/119

It took me two days to copy all my music onto the SD card so I wasn't looking forward to doing it all over again.

_This will wipe out your camera partition,_ so copy off any clips you want to keep before doing this.

Here are the steps as I recall them:

1. Power up the Pi, wait a minute for it to boot and connect via WiFi, then SSH into it
2. Become superuser, make filesystem writeable, unmount the camera storage
`sudo -i`
`/root/bin/remountfs_rw`
`umount /mnt/cam`
3. Follow the instructions above by @therealmarcone: https://github.com/cimryan/teslausb/issues/119#issuecomment-471342299 **starting with the fdisk command** (skip the fallocate because you already have a disk image)
4. As referenced in his explanation, add 'offset=...' to /etc/fstab:
`pico /etc/fstab` or `vi /etc/fstab` as you prefer
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...and add offset= (use the same number you used for `losetup`) to the cam_disk.bin line:
`/backingfiles/cam_disk.bin /mnt/cam vfat noauto,users,umask=000,offset=1048576 0 0`
5. Mount the new partition and you should be good to go
`mount /mnt/cam`

This should then make the setup scripts pull the updated versions from my branch.

Mine is pulls in the necessary changes from @therealmarcone (thank you!) and adds a minor tweak to handle the new subdirectory structure.  Just set REPO and BRANCH accordingly to pull in whoever's built you want.  

After flashing, setting the wpa_supplicant for WFi, removing any old Pi keys in ~/.ssh/known_hosts,   eject and put in Pi

ssh pi@raspberrypi.local

This causes the code to try and move the empty directories to the destination archive which results in nothing actually being uploaded but causing the process to delay the USB host connection by several minutes (depending on how many directories are present).
This creates confusion when connected to the car (if you're not reading the logs every time there is a delay), since the MCU can also stop recognizing the drive and require a restart.

I tested adding the following command after the loop to remove all empty directories so the next time the archive is run it will not have to contend with the empty directories.

I wanted to look at the file permissions but when I remove the raps from the car and plug it into my computer, the CAM and Music drives do not show.  Running: sudo modprobe g_mass_storage does not make them appear either so I can't look to see what the file protection is.

You do have to wait quite a while after the first boot before they would appear.  Then I was able to modify it and get the web dash cam from here to work following his script ( https://github.com/ppamidimarri/TeslaDashcamWeb <https://github.com/ppamidimarri/TeslaDashcamWeb> ) and files were visibly saved but I could not move them or view them (forbidden message).  I realized I was using both cifs and rcloneso I then went to build without the cifs.  Since then, no folder show, and more issues.  I am thinking it is because I am late and making mistakes so will try again tomorrow.

I have a few thoughts here; for example, we could have pre-mount actions that move off existing files, and/or a configurable prune routine (by space, by date, etc.). 

All things being equal, I don't love disconnecting the drive, but I can't empirically prove that it's not the best way to do things. :) It just seems cleaner to say ""once the drive is online, it has one goal: stay online and stable"", since its purpose is to be as available as possible in case the footage is needed.

that said, i've actually been thinking about this quite a bit and have a couple options i'd like to discuss

1. add support for having a non-syncing wifi connection for phones with mobile hotspot. i don't think it makes sense to sync over mobile but we can at least use this for emergency purposes like the scenario you described. in this mode we'd be able to go to a webpage where we can sync selective files just as you described.

1. leverage bluetooth somehow. i *feel* like this is the most elegant way... unfortunately, i'm not as well versed on leveraging this. i plan on doing some research here but i *feel* like we can use bluetooth.

I feel pretty strongly that at the end of running setup, we should have a device independent of the archive mechanism and be left with more or less a dumb usb stick. furthermore, the initial setup should not fail unless it is something catastrophic. the fact that setup can abort just because of a misconfigured archive server (e.g. ip address not reachable) does not seem like a good thing.

I believe we are moving closer to this.

Whether we choose to archive, how and where to archive are configurations that should be easily changeable with minimal to no effort and left up to the end user. I think people will want different ways to utilize the videos that are stored. We need to assume that any storage mechanism will never have 100% uptime so failing to connect should not abort installation of base functionality. If my sftp server is down (e.g. because i'm at work and am setting it up for my home network) I don't see why I can't still go through the setup process and get a working USB drive.

> Given the nature and significance of the changes that we're still making supporting upgrade seems like it'll be challenging. Even communicating the scope of a simplified

Agreed... I started down that route and ended up abandoning it. 

> Reflashing is pretty quick. Maybe it's just because I'm practiced, but it takes me just a few minutes to reflash and set up a Pi from scratch. If the idea is that we want to enable people to apply customizations after the install process maybe we can make that explicitly an option. Maybe we make setup-teslausb call a ""/boot/customize-setup.sh"" if one exists before the make-root-fs-readonly step. And/or maybe we create an option to preserve the /mutable partition.

Maybe it's quick now but it'll get annoying once you get some customization in there. You probably don't back up to Google Drive but if you did you'd see that rclone takes several minutes just to install. And what if you have some music on there? Seems odd that you have to copy over all your music files again just because we want to reconfigure.

> It's not clear to me my the write-credentials-to script was removed. It seems like the (simple) code within it ended up getting duplicated.

That's a fair point. The simple answer is because only the CIFS archive had that mechanism. I believe as a principle we should have all archive have the same interface. If we add it back, we should add it back for all archive mechanisms.

> Why replace get-archive-server-ip-address with lookup-ip-address? I think we actually need to go more specific than more general: To support Azure File Shares, we apparently need to be able to get the name of the server rather than the IP address.

I don't think having a script return an IP address of a single global variable (`$archiveserver`) is very useful. What happens when there are multiple archive servers and we want the addresses of both of them? Or if we need the IP address of another server down the road, I don't think we should keep making bash scripts for that purpose.

If you need to use the server rather than the IP address you can just not use the lookup. I believe the original implementation actually converts the name into and ip address before writing it to a config file -- this is probably likely to cause issues with cloud hosted solutions with dynamic IP addresses.

I think I covered why configure and verify-archive should be split from set up above.

re: archive_module - admittedly i'm not a huge fan of this concept either. i actually think we should define a set of interfaces (bash functions?) that all modules should support in a single file. we instead landed in a place where each interface for each type is in a file -- probably because this is done in bash over an object oriented language.

> I'm not sure we need argument parsing, at this point. I'm arguing that we can skip upgrade, for now, and there don't seem to be any calls to debug().

yea, it seems lame right now, i know. i have grander visions for configure to allow you to add/remove configurations, features, etc. for that command lines will be useful to turn on/off certain features -- i'm happy to leave it out. debug is used in a few places in configure but i understand it seems a little useless at this time.

* You shouldn’t fail base setup unless something’s awfully wrong. Defining ""base"" as ""if you defined nothing or something went wrong you still end up with a usable USB drive and scripts to continue if desired"".
* The partition layout should be pretty standardized (a cam store, tmpfs, mutable, and optionally music). This seems like something that can be made to happen regardless of any configuration provided (with CAMPERCENT=100)
* I think calling a post-base configure should be doable based on config being provided or not. It also means a very stable first stage base setup (as above) can be put in the image, which I like. The standard mutable partition would provide scratch space for downloading further scripts based on either manual or automatic input (via config). 
* I think wifi setup has to be pretty standardized too; in all but the rarest cases I would say that wifi will be required. It could be broken out from the main config file, but at a certain point it feels like you're just mimicking the `wpa_supplicant.conf` functionality. That said, for many people, editing (or generating) a single file is quite appealing, and env vars are pretty friendly. So a well baked wifi-enable script (taking config file or prompting) could/should be built into the base image. 
* Anything baked into the image would also have the option of using Python or other, so they could be less brittle than `bash` (not that I'm knocking bash...I just stink at it. :) )

I have a Jenkins server set up for automatic base image builds now. I'll add you to [my pi-gen repo](https://github.com/rtgoodwin/pi-gen) as a collaborator @cimryan.

I have no issues with the verifying the reachability of the archive servers. The main issue was it was coupled to the ""partition"" script. This is addressed with #81. No action is needed.

I understand your point (and sign me up for the brain-implant file share). I do want to point out we can switch between CIFs and sftp/rscync with no downloads. You can set the respective environment variables and re-run `configure.sh` and it will download the necessary scripts to enable that archive system.

I can argue against either approach as they both have their pros and cons. In the spirit of closing out #81, let's leave this structure alone for the time being. I will put back the writing of the configs per our previous discussion - i'm renaming the script to `write-archive-configs-to.sh` so it will apply to all 3 sync methods (**DONE** - PR #91)

After hearing your input as well as after discussion with @rtgoodwin i believe it's best to keep the configure script simple and maintain its ability to run as a headless setup. Let's remove the bells and whistles until we actually need it. (**DONE** - PR #90)

I have it go high enabled when power is supplied via the USB (car turned on). This then boots up the Pi and it begins monitoring for the low power state to plan for a graceful shutdown.

Achieved this on the PowerBoost board by connecting the USB pin to the EN pin. Also connected to the EN pin is the Pi GPIO through a 10K resistor (as shown in lipopi above) and 100K resistor to GND (as shown in lipopi above) to flip it to off when the other two no longer give a high signal. The LB on the PowerBoost board is connected to the Pi GPIO as shown in the demo above.

We know that files aren't deleted until they're fully transferred. You can confirm this by writing a large file into the TeslaCam directory and naming it, say, saved-1.blob. You can watch your network share to see it start to copy. While it's copying, pull the power from the Pi. Then plug the Pi in, again. It'll start copying the file, again, and copy the whole thing to the share, if you let it, overwriting the bad file with the whole good file. If you do the same thing, deleting the partial file from the share before you plug the Pi back in, you'll see the whole file get copied to the share. So, none of the data in the file was removed from the Pi until the whole file was on the share.

The advantage of this move operation over a copy operation is that the system automatically reclaims space. If we copy instead of move, we have to implement some process to free up space.

It looks like we're going to be adding a partition which is read/write on the SD card. We can move the logs to that partition and we can record the file sizes of the files before they're moved. If we find that the file sizes are different from what we're seeing transferred then we'll know that we're not getting the data. If the file sizes are the same, though, we'll know that copying instead of moving won't provide a benefit.

In the mean time, if you'd like to try running with copy instead of move, you can edit /root/bin/archive-clips.sh and replace the mv command with a cp command.",NA,https://api.github.com/repos/cimryan/teslausb/issues/67/comments,https://github.com/cimryan/teslausb/issues/67#issuecomment-433536460,https://api.github.com/repos/cimryan/teslausb/issues/67

I will try updating mine to a copy, but given that the files have to be specified to be saved, I do not believe that the space issue is very significant.

1) Fork the repo (upper right corner button). Then make sure you're in your fork, not cimyran/teslausb
2) Find the file you want to edit
3) Edit it with the pencil (if you're comfortable doing all the changes in the browser, else copy it out to your editor, then paste it back)
4) When it asks to save at the bottom, choose ""a new branch"" (call it whatever you want) and add comments.

The Github for (your OS) Desktop app is pretty useful too, though there are tons. It manages the clone/branch/push process for you but you still edit outside of it. 

The process is pretty much the same every time, and, as a relative newb myself, I find even little things are appreciated. :)

Write to card, reinsert it into PC so it mounts `boot` folder. Then create in `boot` a file called `teslausb_setup_variables.conf` and put the vars in it like so (no quotes on any):

export sharename=your_archive_share_name
export shareuser=username
export sharepassword=password
export campercent=100
export SSID=your_ssid
export WIFIPASS=your_pass

* Boot it in your Pi, give it a bit, watching for a series of flashes (2, 3, 4, 5, maybe 6) and then a reboot and/or the CAM to become available on your PC/Mac. 
* The Pi should be available at `teslausb.local` over Wifi (if it works) or USB networking (if it doesn't). Takes about 5 minutes for me.  You should see in `boot` the `TESLAUSB_SETUP_FINISHED` and `WIFI_ENABLED` files as markers of success too. 
* I forgot to create the TeslaCam folder, so you'll need to do that before taking to your car.

I didn't make a Windows version of the initial script, because I (still) don't have Windows.

Oh definitely don’t want end users messing with `pi-gen`. We take the image as far as we want and freeze it. I just put the background there in case  others wanted to do similar development or understand how it works to drive more changes. 

LMK if there are thoughts on more to push into the image, or alternate ways of tracking progress.  Trying to find the balance between having to rebuild the image frequently vs keeping some pieces easily updateable (ie outside the image). It’s not hard but is sufficiently long and annoying to rebuild it. :) 

If we feel we’re fairly stable with most of the scripts (which is the only reason I have them outside currently, for changes), I can make a flashable image requiring only the config file and put it up for people to play with. There’s nothing stopping that now, I just wanted to get opinions and some testers on the ideal experience.

I've had the CAM drive disappear twice in car (using the existing image and steps) as indicated by the Dashcam icon disappearing randomly while driving. In that vein, is it really needed to unmount the USB share to archive? (And thus the checks for it to be reachable etc.) The original Reddit post did it ti

I know you don't want R/W going on at the same time on the partition but the same files wouldn't be being modified (since saved files by default are already written out). And since the cam using rolling date and times in the filename, the presence or removal of files shouldn't affect anything while keeping the drive alive. 

@cimryan and others, thoughts on this? Certainly would make a flashable image easier to use and test if we could just note the archive wasn't reachable but the USB share functionality stayed solid. My tentative thinking is to dumb it down to always mount and if the loop tries to archive and it isn't reachable, touch a file `ARCHIVE_UNREACHABLE` in the CAM folder.

1. Leave the g_mass_storage module loaded at all times.
1. Leave the backing file mounted at all times.

Have you determined that the cause of the camera icon disappearing is the unloading of the g_mass_storage module?

Fundamentally my concern with accessing the backing file through two different file system layers simultaneously is that it's unsupported, and the problem with taking a dependency on unsupported behavior, even if you test it thoroughly, is that you never know what sort of environmental change may cause a break.

Great question, I don't know for sure that g_mass_storage is the issue, I just know that it disappeared, and my thought was something that went awry with the archive loop, and started thinking through how to make that more solid. I can maybe add some logging to test that...I'll just have to think through where to put it. I do know that I am frequently finding FSCK records which suggests to me something is happening to make the disk dirty, but that could be the Tesla bug. ;) 

Have to do some thinking on this, both re: stability and re: easily testable/flashable image. Open to continued thoughts. 

Edit: I see you just massively updated the loops, AND a pending `rsync` PR, so some of this might have been addressed/made moot.

I agree, especially since in this case I'm sitting at a desk on the home network with extremely strong wireless (far closer and zero walls, vs being in the car). I can't rule out some wireless weirdness of course, although the laptop the Pi is connected to never seems to drop signal.

Write to card, reinsert it into PC so it mounts `boot` folder. Then create in `boot` a file called `teslausb_setup_variables.conf` and put the vars in it like so (no quotes on any):
```
export archiveserver=your_archive_name_or_ip
export sharename=your_archive_share_name
export shareuser=username
export sharepassword=password
export campercent=100
export SSID=your_ssid
export WIFIPASS=your_pass
```
* Boot it in your Pi, give it a bit, watching for a series of flashes (2, 3, 4, 5, maybe 6) and then a reboot and/or the CAM to become available on your PC/Mac. 
* The Pi should be available at `teslausb.local` over Wifi (if it works) or USB networking (if it doesn't). Takes about 5 minutes for me.  You should see in `boot` the `TESLAUSB_SETUP_FINISHED` and `WIFI_ENABLED` files as markers of success too. 
* I forgot to create the TeslaCam folder, so you'll need to do that before taking to your car. 

LMK if it does/doesn't work for you please, feedback needed! :) Worked great just now; I've only tried it with campercent=100.

- I'm assuming when the Pi boots, it will download the `setup-tesla usb` script and run it?  If so, it would be useful to expose the GitUser and GitBranch that you want to use for running the setup script.
- I set my Pi up for connecting to two wifi networks.  Are the SSID and WiFIPASS variables required?  Can I still manually create the wpa_supplicant.conf file?

* Currently I pre-download the scripts before cooking the image, to minimize the chances of failure in a headless setup, and to ensure upstream changes haven't borked something. :) 

I may make that an option at some point when the setup script (or my version of it for headless) is stable enough to trust that the scripts can download and be re-run and not repeat steps, etc. For example, when rsync/SFTP gets merged in, I'll want to ensure that the ""headless"" version of that setup can be created and not break any current options/combinations. The loop and archive scripts could probably be downloaded automatically since they're quite self-contained. Anyway, all this can/could change if we can move to a ""headless-ready"" main setup script/process.  

I'd also be happy to add (back) the option to copy scripts from `/boot/somedir` if you/user want to put your own there. The [headless prep script](https://github.com/rtgoodwin/teslausb/blob/headless-patch/headless-scripts/setup-piForHeadlessBuild.sh) did that before: download and put them in the `boot` dir to copy over during setup, but I moved to just downloading them and refreshing the image for stability, and TBH the experience of a single `.conf` file is pretty compelling to me. :)  The prep script is still there for me to refer to if needed or for another purpose if desired. 

Overall, I want to minimize any chance that it doesn't come up with networking configured and ready to troubleshoot, but also have it tightly looped to do its best to do setup if not already completed. 

* The image will still take a wpa_supplicant file if present. 

It's set to check:

1) ""did the user pass in `SSID/WIFIPASS`?"". 
2) ""is there a `/boot/WIFI_ENABLED` file? If not, maybe the user still needs to setup wifi
3) if both are met, removes the wpa_supplicant file with one with the new info and reboots 

This is checked on every boot in case you goof or change network details. If the conditions aren't met, the image takes its normal path to suck in the wpa_supplicant.conf file from /boot. 

I think that kind of gives the best of both worlds...simple for simple setups, and anyone advanced enough to need two networks can create the wpa_supplicant file. 

Open to feedback, and thanks for testing! I'll make sure the latest changes to `pi-gen` are pushed up later today so you can look over the scripts. It's just a little bit of extra stuff in `rc.local`, some patching moved to the image side (changing hostname, hosts, enabling ssh, config file, cmdline.txt) and then the modified (and heavily commented out) `teslausb-setup-headless` in my repo.

Odd.  So you're getting (size * 100) which is definitely not right, but I didn't change anything about those scripts. (Should be size *1 obviously, 100 / 100.) I'll re-download the latest ancillary scripts to see if something changed. Now, why it worked just fine for me, same SD size and everything, is rather curious.  I'll probably also add some setup logging into the partition/files creation since that is one of the most prone bits to fail. 

And just to confirm, you DID expect the archive to be unreachable? I.e. wifi is up but you're not at your server, or Wifi didn't come up? (""Expected an error about that"" could be read as ""I got the expected error"" or ""I would have expected an error (about X or Y)"".) 

LMK if you see it again; I'll test it again on my side but also improve the logging and release a new image. VERY much appreciated! :)

Flash the image, and put `teslausb_setup_variables.conf` in the `boot` dir:
```
export archiveserver=your_archive_name_or_ip

export HEADLESS_SETUP=true
export REPO=rtgoodwin
export BRANCH=headless-patch
``` 
(setup to track my branch for testing since it has the changes to the main setup file)

Pop in Pi Z W and boot!

You can always ssh in and `tail -f /boot/teslausb-headless-setup.log` for progress. I usually wait until I can ping it over wifi, but to each their own. 

Notes (background, not needed for setup):

* It does the bare minimum it needs to setup wifi, then grab and start executing the main script with the variables above. Even if it fails, or you didn't provide the conf file, it's still a ready bootable image for Pi Zero W with USB networking enabled and available at `teslausb.local`
* If HEADLESS_SETUP=true, then the setup script is run in headless mode. I think I might change the first boot procedure to check for this to be ""true"" overall, instead of just looking for TESLAUSB_SETUP_FINISHED, so the image is useful for either headless or regular setup. 
* I have only tested with CIFS so far though I don't think rsync should fail. 
* It's set to use the new variable to determine whether to flash LEDs for progress
* For reasons unknown to me, `wget` is reaaaaally slow on my setup or sometimes hangs. Using curl for now in the setup script. They should be functionally equal in this usage, and it's much faster. 
* If it doesn't finish (return to flashing LED normally after a few minutes and CAM mounts), you can always ssh in and run /etc/rc.local and both scripts seem to be solid enough to re-run safely. Just give it some time to finish. :) 
* Need to still export the `setup_progress` function down into the ancillary scripts just for visibility. 
* I need to start putting the images somewhere other than Dropbox too when solid. I think it's in great shape now, but some nice touches as mentioned above are probably useful.

Wait...did you add the HEADLESS_SETUP=true to the conf file? The logging function checks for that now to write the log. 

Can you paste the `wpa_supplicant` file and conf file? (Obviously redact any personal information, but if there's any kind of special character or spacing in your values it would be good to know.)  Thank you for testing! 

EDIT: 
I updated the image in [previous comment](https://github.com/cimryan/teslausb/issues/39#issuecomment-433487685) to 10-27 date with a much safer method of generating the wpa_supplicant.conf file. I also added sample `.conf.sample` files but make sure you have all the variables noted in the comment, especially my branch/repo and the HEADLESS_SETUP=true set.

( I added a good old fashioned `dos2unix` to cover this scenario.)

Please check out https://github.com/rtgoodwin/teslausb/releases for the v.9-beta1 release (or later, if I make more changes when you read this). Instructions are the same as previous posts, but I've also started [writing out the Readme](https://github.com/rtgoodwin/teslausb/tree/headless-patch/setup/headless_setup) to be applicable to using the image for both headless and manual modes of setup (as that's my goal at this point) and it should cover it. LMK if it doesn't.  

@cimryan I think the image is actually ready to go for manual setup as is; if you can check it out I'd appreciate it. With the Readme info (obviously just the relevant parts), I think it's a candidate for replacing the first part of setup now, or at least being an option. If you do absolutely nothing but flash the image, it will come up as USB networked and ready to go. From there it's a choice to automate the wifi if you want (just add those vars) or the full setup (add all the vars), minus RSYNC since that still requires manual intervention at the moment. I feel like this may be the way to go moving forward even for regular setup; starting from an image encourages people to write carefully tested scripts that will handle automation well. (And gets rid of a bunch of setup, and manual setup scripts 😄 ).

- Added a script for easier remounting filesystem r/w
- Updated Readme to reflect new script
- Added a check for the Pushover send to ensure that it's only sent if $move_count is greater than 0. `bash -eu` was causing the archive script to error out when the Pushover command ran and the count was `0`. I would think `0` would be valid to pass to it, but...bash I guess. Anyway, no need to send it if 0 files were copied. 
- Added `""` in the updater script wifi section for the ssid/pass. Without the `""` the auto setup doesn't work. (Tested.)

This line did the trick: `modprobe g_mass_storage file=/backingfiles/cam_disk.bin stall=0`. Immediately the drive showed up. Not sure why that isn't being needed for others, unless Windows maybe triggers something to happen with the USB negotiation.

All my testing is in a scenario where the ARCHIVESERVER is always reachable. So, of course the drive gets unmounted from my Mac. (Facepalm) At least that seems to be the scenario. 

@firedfly in your testing were they showing up if your laptop+Pi were on the same network as your ARCHIVESERVER? 

@cimryan am I totally misreading the mount logic? The original script loaded `g_mass_storage` in rc.local, presumably for this reason, and then had slightly different logic as to when to disconnect. 

So, and again I could be really off on this whole thing, this makes this really a dev problem, or if someone wants to inspect the USB share on their machine while the Pi is on the network.  (The latter being a pretty reasonable case, actually. In fact, the instructions currently have you create the TeslaCam folder that way, and/or copy music.)

Could always just leave it mounted, but R/W access from both sides is a Bad Thing(tm), so looking for compromises. I'm not sure how to get around that. 

I suppose you could:

-  remount the USB share `ro` once the archive is reachable. Then at least someone could manually copy off files using their PC if the archive process was just not super successful/consistent. If it's plugged into the car, Tesla _should_ detect it dis/appearing, see it's not writeable, and that'd probably be fine since you likely don't want footage of the inside (or outside) of your garage/parking structure. The downside would be if Tesla does release a method to provide constant power to both dashcam AND the USB ports, but that seems unlikely for the moment. 

- Then update the copy process to test presence of the target `saved-` file and if it `exists && is same size (or date?)` then don't copy, just delete it from the `rw` `/mnt/cam`. This is to cover ""I brought the Pi inside, and copied a ton of data off of it, then put it back in the car"". (Since deleting files wouldn't be allowed in `ro`.) 

Thoughts? This probably ends up getting closed and a new issue opened to allow for this scenario if we want it. It seems like it has value. Or it's an actual bug/timing issue.

changed, and 2) the Pi would refuse to mount it entirely. I don't have any

see.

If you can SSH into your Pi still, can you `sudo -i` and `mount -a -v` and
paste that back?

I'm using `campercent=100` on a 64GB card, and it creates a ~53GB CAM mount just fine. I can put a TeslaCam folder on it and put files in that folder on Windows, but now the problem comes from reading that drive on the teslausb pi. For some reason, the `/mnt/cam/` folder is empty, despite having the `TeslaCam` folder (and files in it) that persists through ejecting and plugging back in the teslausb pi. Is my script looking at the wrong spot? I know the traditional method is to move the files over from the cam mount to the archive mount, which is mounted to a shared drive. But that isn't needed for rsync, since it can just copy directly from the cam mount folder.

I also notice that Windows pops up with this when the teslausb pi first boots and connects to my PC:

Another issue is that it also keeps disconnecting even though the archive server is reachable.

Per https://help.apple.com/deployment/macos/#/ior96b240d12 High Sierra should be version 3.0. Leaving off the version actually makes it default to v1 per https://www.systutorials.com/docs/linux/man/8-mount.cifs/#lbAE so presumably it's more compatible and/or didn't require some alternate setting or config I was missing on the Mac share. 

Ultimately, I just discovered it by reading the archive mount log; it's a silent failure right now unless you know to look there.

My read of the initial scripts was that they were intended to just copy the clips that one had elected to save. Do you think that intention should be reconsidered?

*The filename format for saved clips is (example) saved-front-2018-10-08_09-00.mp4
(so saved-camera-year-month-day_hour-minute.mp4)*

*Edit: looks like the rolling buffer is recent-front-year-month-day_hour(24 hour fmt)_segment, where segment appears to be each minute for the last hour, and the minute segments get rolled off as the hour rounds. So you have (example) `recent-front-2018-10-09_17-56.mp4`, `57`, `58`, `59`, then it rolls to `18-00.mp4` and so on.*
*Edit2: Ok I'm still not 100% sure on the specs there, but there are at least those kinds of files, and also what seems to be a lock file (buffer) in the root. I guess all things considered, you could do worse than just copying everything off out of the folder. :)*

So, not fully determined, but that's my working theory.  I.e. if you wanted to preserve rolling buffer, it's a series of one minute clips named as above. And if the car shuts off, it seems to truncate the currently open file, leaving it unusable. See screenshot, with a working 1 minute (30.1mb) file, followed by the next segment which truncated at 14.1mb and doesn't appear to be a valid .mp4.  You *might* want to pull this stuff off if you've forgotten to do a manual save from the touch screen.

As with all things, probably making it an option makes sense. Either in the config file or in the archive move loop. Especially since there's really not much of a window for getting the clips copied off before the car powers off, and since it can take up to 1 minute for the drive to come online when the car is powered on.  You could then choose to optimize for ""completeness"" (copy all) or ""least amount of time sitting in the car before leaving/arriving"" (copy saved* only).  When I parked earlier, I made a point of getting out of the car slowly, grabbing stuff from the front seat, etc., and still only got a few files copied. 

Hopefully this makes some sense, it's been a long day. 😄 It's never going to be perfect; but sitting in the car for an extra minute or 2 (or if someone works out a battery solution) is still a lot better than having to shuffle a USB drive back and forth. And way cooler...
