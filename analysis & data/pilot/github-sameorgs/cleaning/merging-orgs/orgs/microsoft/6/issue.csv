In order to use this metadata, either qualify it by specifying %(EmbeddedResource.TargetPath), or ensure that all items in this list define a value for this metadata.`

This was working fine until 0.4.3 so my best guess is it is caused by this commit: https://github.com/mhutch/MonoDevelop.AddinMaker/commit/dd120380b91c00414c0bcd39498b077e84d41ab9#diff-bdc8ea55a71e0c73099996196023e145

https://github.com/mono/mono-addins/blob/e84472dcd17b61a904538e1cc2e19f4b064c7068/Mono.Addins/Mono.Addins.Database/AddinFileSystemExtension.cs#L170

AddinScanner.Dispose() then calls database.FileSystem.CleanupReflector ();:

This change does two things:
1. Dispose of the Registry after the ResolveMonoDevelopAddins task is done, which in turn disposes the Cecil Reflector
2. Removes the overridden GetReflectorForFile from CecilReflectorExtension since that is equivalent to the base implementation but without the caching. The base implementation does proper caching.

The fix has many benefits, such as:
1. Not allocating many file handles
2. Cleanup file handles after use
3. Improve build perf from 3.4 to 2.1 seconds on a solution with two addin projects

---

In Visual Studio for Mac (version details attached), when a developer adds an **Addin Reference** to an addin/extension project, it fails with the message **Save Failed**. Upon closing and reopening the addin project, the added reference is not included.

Example:
![save-failed-issue](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3260473/25974736/f573e58a-36ed-11e7-86f6-8ef2e9dc78fa.gif)

This is an issue as addin developers cannot reference other addins. For me, this means that MFractor cannot support Visual Studio for Mac as I cannot reference core addins like MonoDevelop.MonoAndroid, MonoDevelop.Refactoring etc.

Based on the log information, I can see an exception is being thrown by the MSBuild addin:

```

Steps To Reproduce
---

 1. Open Visual Studio for Mac
 2. Create a new Addin project
 3. In the new addin project, right click on **Addin References** and add a reference to any addin
 4. After a short pause, a dialog displaying **Save failed** displays.
 5. If you then close and re-open the project you'll see the reference was not successfully included.

Expected Result
---
Upon including an Addin Reference, the save completes successfully and the addin is included into the addin project without issue.

Actual Result
---
When including an Addin Reference, the save operation fails and the addin is not included into the addin project.

When debugging an addin project in a default install of XS6, launch of the new XS instance [fails](https://gist.github.com/sandyarmstrong/1f773d57ad997bd8e9db) because it is using the default configured .NET runtime, which is 32-bit. XS6 on Mac now requires 64-bit Mono.

You need to go to `Preferences -> Projects -> .NET Runtimes` and select a 64-bit runtime.

Since upgrading to XS6 and Addin Maker 1.3.0, I can no longer set my addin project to be the startup project of my solution.

I can still debug via the `Start Debugging Item` context menu option, it's just much less convenient than cmd+enter. :-)

Debugging this it looks like the addin maker refreshes [all child nodes of the project](https://github.com/mhutch/MonoDevelop.AddinMaker/blob/f9d4a0174f3428205ee5134220bab7acb7d4d7a6/AddinProjectNodeBuilder.cs#L54) when any reference is changed.

Not sure where best to fix this. I guess MonoDevelop could be made more defensive to handle an existing reference. Or maybe the addin maker could only refresh its AddinReferenceFolder, assuming that is all that needs to be refreshed.

I believe [this line](https://github.com/mhutch/MonoDevelop.AddinMaker/blob/master/MonoDevelop.Addins.Tasks/ResolveMonoDevelopAddins.cs#L52) is the culprit, where it uses the addin's current version rather than checking if something is specified by `addinName.GetMetadata(""Version"")` first.

I'm stumped...MonoDevelop and Xamarin Studio run fine by themselves, so how do I **re-enable(?)** the `MonoDevelop.Core` addin in the AddinMaker Project?

Hi, I tried to open this project with MonoDevelop-5.0.1 in Linux since I haven't been able to locate the _Addin Maker_ addin in the Linux addin repository of MonoDevelop, but I can't get it to work.
I get the error:

```
Could not load project 'MonoDevelop.AddinMaker.csproj' with unknown item type '{7DBEB09D-BB9F-4D92-A141-A009135475EF}'
```

which seems be due to the fact that _Addin Maker_ is missing in the Linux Addin-Repo.

Just for fun adding the windows repository used in Xamarin Studio and installing the _Addin Maker_ gave me the possiblity to open the project in MonoDevelop, building however results in 2 Errors I haven't been able to resolve:

TFTensor  object usually obtained from a CPU array meaning a need of data copy from a device(GPU) to a host (CPU). This pipleine architecture is considerably slow for a large dataset (e.g. large images).

My pipeline considers the image processing via cuda(managedCuda wrapper) and its libraries (npp).

Of course, one can copy it to the host to get a standard host 
```c#  
d_array.CopytoHost(h_array);
```

Build fails to copy all required linux shared objects for TensorFlow version 1.15, TensorFlowSharp version 1.15.1.

**To Reproduce**
Run using TensorFlowSharp 1.15.1 NuGet packages on linux.

**Expected behavior**
Required dependencies to be available.

**Exception**
Unhandled Exception: System.DllNotFoundException: Unable to load shared library 'libtensorflow' or one of its dependencies.

**Desktop (please complete the following information):**
Debian GNU/Linux 9 (stretch) within Docker container.

**Additional context**
Only `libtensorflow.so` and `libtensorflow_framework.so` are copied from `libtensorflow\lib` to `runtimes\linux\native\` as part of the build specified in `TensorFlowSharp.csproj`. The following additional libraries from libtensorflow are also required for running TensorFlow 1.15 on linux:
```
libtensorflow.so.1
libtensorflow.so.1.15.0
libtensorflow_framework.so.1
libtensorflow_framework.so.1.15.0
```

I suspect the same issue exists for the .dylib files required by OS X, though have not tested this myself.
 
I propose replacing the following lines in TensorFlowSharp.csproj:
```
<None Include=""..\native\libtensorflow.so"" Link=""nuget\runtimes\linux\native\libtensorflow.so"" PackagePath=""runtimes\linux\native\libtensorflow.so"" Pack=""true"" />

```
 
With the following:
```
<None Include=""..\native\libtensorflow*.so*"">
  <Link>nuget\runtimes\linux\native\%(Filename)%(Extension)</Link>

Debug.Log(mrcnn_detection.GetValue(jagged: true).GetType());  // System.Single[][][]
```
`

I want to get the return value of detection, which is the first output.

This returns (float float tuple) at model.py on the mask rcnnn.

But, the Getvalue() returned the single[][][] types.

I don't know how to handle this output.

When working with large datasets, it can be cumbersome to have to copy data between CPU and GPU, especially when working in a pipeline architecture.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
I am working in a pipeline architecture where all intermediary data resides in the GPU. I am interested in passing data already in the GPU into a DL network with the output still residing in the GPU to be passed to the next element in a pipeline. Essentially I would like to pass a cuda array into the network, get an output and convert back into a cuda array. I’d like to do this without having to perform CPU/GPU copies. Is this possible at the moment?

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
To my understanding PyTorch and PyCuda can do this, but I need to work within a C# environment.  

**Additional context**
Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here.

I am looking to train a model in TensorFlow with Python and then do inference in C#.  I used this MNist example as a guide: https://github.com/sdg002/MNISTpng

In particular, I have questions on the following line:
`
runner.AddInput(graph[""conv1_input""][0], tensor);
 runner.Fetch(graph[""activation_4/Softmax""][0]);
`

Where are ""conv1_input"" and ""activation_4/Softmax"" defined in the pb file?  I believe these are the input and output layers of the network?  Where were these originally defined?  I am looking at ""TrainedMnistFromFolder.py"" and I see a ""conv1"" layer.  I also see activation layers defined, one of which is the ""softmax"" function.  But how do these become ""conv1_input"" and ""activation_4/Softmax"" when using inference in C#.

Is there a way to load a pb file and see these layers along with the names (or even get these by reading them in Python)?  Sorry I am relatively new working with pb files.  The key is understanding how to connect to the model at both input and output.

By the way sorry for the issues with the code formatting.. not sure what I am doing wrong.

You've been very vocal about the situation in Bolivia and us Bolivian techies are really worried about this because it doesn't appear that you have all the information about what exactly happened and what is happening but you are an influential tech person in the twitterosphere. You have been dismissive of attempts to get information to your direction. **This is understandable**, these attempts occurred in twitter where it is very difficult to really trust if others are fake personas or bots trying to social engineer an opinion.

I am making this post here specifically so that I can actually have a bit of your attention. It's not going to take much.

**Was there an electoral fraud in Bolivia?** It is not my intention to change your mind. But it is my intention to make sure that you actually have access to all the information available.  I am also particularly interested in how a technologically-literate person without as many biases as I would react from seeing the technical reports  I am about to post.

**First, a timeline:**

* October 20-th: Elections happen

* October 20-th, night: Preliminary results at 85% of the votes predict a second round. But with 15% of the votes not accounted yet, and the gap between the first and second place being only barely smaller than necessary for a second round, nothing is confirmed.

* October 20-th, night: Preliminary results  page stops updating the results.  There's confusion as to why this happened.

* October 21-st, afternoon: people are anxious as there's rumours of fraud. Vigils begin in the largest cities.

* October 21-st, night: Preliminary results suddenly start updating again and this time the results show that the gap is large enough for a first round win. Protests explode all over the country because the right is certain that there was a fraud.

In these initial days there was no real evidence of fraud. Only the suspicious halt of the preliminary results and the convenient moment they came back.

There were many claims of statistical anomalies. You posted a link to cepr articles like this one:  http://cepr.net/press-center/press-releases/no-evidence-that-bolivian-election-results-were-affected-by-irregularities-or-fraud-statistical-analysis-shows  Debunking the statistical claims. I think the statistical analysis argument has been discussed throughly and that thanks to those cepr articles you are properly informed regarding them. I do agree that geography explains the statistical variation.

**Actual Audits**

Statistical arguments were popular during the early days of the conflict because we didn't have much work in other fronts. But besides of grass roots work to accrue reasons to suspect the results. There were two audits requested by the Plurinational State of Bolivia itself. One by OAS and one by ""Ethical Hacking Group"", a white hat consulting firm that focused on the technological side of the elections system.  Both audits claim that the elections' results lack validity. I am going to focus on the EHCG report because that's the language we both speak as computer-literate people.

**EHCG findings**

The goal of this post is to get you access to this report. It's in Spanish, but that ought not to be a problem for you specifically. Once again, I do not intend for you to change your mind. But I am actually curious as to how you would react to the incidents being spoken of in this report.

https://blog.ehcgroup.io/index.php/2019/11/08/ehc-group-informe-consolidado-elecciones-bolivia-2019/

**A summary:**

It is difficult for me to provide this summary without coloring it with my own opinions regarding what this report implies. But I will try because I think this summary is going to be a good explanation of why you need to read the report.

* Direct SSH accesses to the server during the counting processes.
* Software received patches during the counting process and the patches did not go through the verification stablished by protocols set by TSE itself.
* Unknown server sent massive number of updates to preliminary results software.
* Database was modified manually without matching protocol.
* Software vulnerabilities.


**Timeline (continued)**

* November 8-th EHCG publish their report.
* November 8-th : Police Mutiny.
* November 10-th , morning: OAS Audit team publish report
* November 10-th , morning: President Morales announces that the electtions will be null and there will be new elections
* November 10-th , afternoon: President Morales resigns
* November 11-th , afternoon: President Morales seeks asylum in Mexico



All I ask is that you read that EHCG report and give it a consideration. In case you don't change your conclusions even after reading that report, it would be extremely interesting to hear the thought process behind that conclusion.

I have TensorflowSharp running successfully on CPU; my model gives expected output.
I have Tensorflow 1.14 running successfully locally on GPU using CUDA 10.0 and CUDNN 7.6 (with python).
I would like to run TensorflowSharp on GPU, so replaced the libtensorflow.dll with _pywrap_tensorflow_internal.pyd (renamed to libtensorflow.dll) in 'packages\TensorFlowSharp.1.13.0\runtimes\win7-x64'. I also set the compile architecture to x64. 
It loads the dll successfully, however it will always throw a CUDNN mismatch error.

**To Reproduce**
See above.

Note: I do not have time to create models, train models, create samples from scratch and then adding your 3-4 lines of code to a sample to debug your problem.   You need to provide a complete test case.

**Expected behavior**
I would figure it would run on GPU fine, since it runs fine from python as well.

Im using Unity3D TensorflowSharp plugin but unfortunately it hasn't been updated since last year and I cant run it on iOS,it has errors and it wont run with models trained with newer versions of Tensorflow .My inquiry is how can we use the TensorflowSharp base code to link to tensorflow.a library so that we can use it in Unity and on iOS .The difference between Unity TensorflowSharp and your is the using '__Internal'  when importing the Tensorflow native library .Your work is amazing and code works pretty fast on PC and it is way better than many plugins I've tried so far but Im really struggling trying to fit it to work with iOS .

I implemented a **Griffin-Lim algorithm**(GL, a speech processing method used for reconstructing wave from mel-spectrogram) with TF-python, and dump it into a pb file.
Then I load graph of Griffin-Lim from the pb file, and using runner.Run() to call the computing graph and get the output of the last Node.

The result of output is correct and the voice quality is on par with TF-python generated.
But runner.Run() in TF# runs 5-10 times slower than session.Run() in TF-python.
For example, to generate a **3 seconds wave**, runner.Run() in TF# need about **2.7 seconds**, but session.Run() in TF-python only need **0.3-0.6 seconds**.

here are the generate key codes:

                TFTensor input = new TFTensor(melSpectrum);
                var runner = this.session.GetRunner();
                runner.AddInput(this.input, input);
                runner.Fetch(this.output);
                TFTensor[] results = runner.Run();

**To Reproduce**
I went back and checked the related code I call runner.Run().
1. I have already kept a TFSession instant, so the solution in https://github.com/migueldeicaza/TensorFlowSharp/issues/330 can not help.
2. When I initialize the session & graph, I also warm up them by faking a melSpectrum and calling upper codes. If sess& graph weren't warmed up, runner.Run() will cost 6.8-7seconds to generate a 3 seconds wav.

**Expected behavior**
I think runner.Run()  in TF# should run as fast as session.Run() in TF-python

I have a simple C# console EXE (.NET Framework which uses Version 1.13.0 of **TensorFlowSharp** . The EXE produces this error when consuming a TF model file produced using Version 1.14.0 of **tensorflow-gpu**     . The EXE worked beautifully few months ago. I upgraded the version of TF and ran into this problem.

```

**To Reproduce**
- Train MNIST using TF 1.14 (GPU)
- Export model and weights to .PB
- Use 1.13 TensorflowSharp to import the graph


**Expected behavior**
The same TensorFlowSharp code worked with older Tensorflow models.


**Desktop (please complete the following information):**
 - OS: Windows 10
 - Version: TF 1.14 , TensorFlowSharp 1.13


**What solved the problem?**
I copied over the latest tensorflow.dll as libtensorflow.dll into the output directory of the C# executable project.

https://www.tensorflow.org/install/lang_c



Thank you for all the efforts. I am happy to provide further Python scripts if you want test cases.

My graph is trained in Python with Tensorflow 1.12 and uses [tf.keras.layers.Lambda](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Lambda) as it's input layer, named `lambda_input`. When running it with an image input tensor with TensorFlowSharp 1.12 in .NET Core 2.2, I get the following error:
""Tensor lambda_input:0, specified in either feed_devices or fetch_devices was not found in the Graph""

Likewise if I just skip the input tensor, I get ""Tensor output/Softmax:0, specified in either feed_devices or fetch_devices was not found in the Graph""

**To Reproduce**
[bug.zip](https://github.com/migueldeicaza/TensorFlowSharp/files/3388533/bug.zip)

I've appended my model and a simple script that reproduces the issue. It occurs when I run the runner, regardless if there's input or not:
```csharp
var graphBytes = File.ReadAllBytes(""frozen.pb"");
var graph = new TFGraph();
graph.Import(graphBytes);

var runner = new TFSession().GetRunner();
var gInput = graph[""lambda_input""];
var gResult = graph[""output/Softmax""];

// runner.AddInput(gInput[0], myImageTensor);
runner.Fetch(gResult[0]);

var result = runner.Run()[0];
```

**Expected behavior**
The model should run normally without error.

Are lambda layers supported by TensorflowSharp? I know they're a problem in Tensorflow.js.

Calling `TFGraph.Import` within a `TFGraph.WithDevice` scope does not set device for the nodes in the imported graph.

**To Reproduce**
```
var path = GetGraphPath(); // the path of the graph file
var graph = new TFGraph();
using (var device = graph.WithDevice(""/device:GPU:1""))

I am trying to use tensorflow audio recognition model in unity using TensorFlowSharp but getting error when trying to fetch the values.

**To Reproduce**
Download model from http://download.tensorflow.org/models/speech_commands_v0.02.zip

Note: I do not have time to create models, train models, create samples from scratch and then adding your 3-4 lines of code to a sample to debug your problem.   You need to provide a complete test case.

**Expected behaviour**
Model should have taken the string and tensor as input and given the output ""yes"".
I manually converted a simple .wav file saying ""yes"" into tensors and then pasted them into the file. After that, I tried getting the result from the model but I am getting the error:

There are other ways to save tensorflow libraries and load them in C# and run them in recall mode or evaluate mode from there.  If this library can actually setup ,  train , valuate and save models using C#  it would really be nice to be  made clear on the first page.. and if it cannot train that sentence is also confusing.

I am sorry for having to ask this. Yes I could spend fifteen minutes reading and get the answer.

I guess that the image is preprocessed in such a way:
1. Scale the image to 244 x 244 pixel
2. Each byte of RGB is substracted by a mean value of 117
(The code for pre-processing is defined in _ImageUtil.cs_). 

But in the official notebook example from Tensorflow Object Detection (_object_detection_tutorial.ipynb_), the image is simply reshaped to (1,W,H,3) before feeding to the network for inference. No scaling or mean subtraction is performed.

For curiosity, I made a new **CreateTensorFromImageFile2** function as follows:
```
        public static unsafe TFTensor CreateTensorFromImageFile2(string inputFileName, TFDataType destinationDataType = TFDataType.Float)
        {
            Bitmap bitmap = new Bitmap(inputFileName);

            BitmapData data = bitmap.LockBits(new Rectangle(0, 0, bitmap.Width, bitmap.Height), ImageLockMode.ReadOnly, PixelFormat.Format24bppRgb);

            var matrix = new byte[1, bitmap.Height, bitmap.Width, 3];

            byte* scan0 = (byte*)data.Scan0.ToPointer();
            
            for (int i = 0; i < data.Height; ++i)
            {
                for (int j = 0; j < data.Width; ++j)
                {
                    byte* pixelData = scan0 + i * data.Stride + j * 3;
                    matrix[0, i, j, 0] = pixelData[0];
                    matrix[0, i, j, 1] = pixelData[1];
                    matrix[0, i, j, 2] = pixelData[2];
                }
            }
            bitmap.UnlockBits(data);

            TFTensor tensor = matrix;
            return tensor;
        }
```
To my surprise, the output of the new method seems to be a little better than the original one. I attached below 2 outputs for reference.

The 1st one is from the original example, and the 2nd one used the new **CreateTensorFromImageFile2** function to load image as tensor.

The current implementation of the Dipose/Finalization pattern for TFDisposable based classes can lead to memory access violations when compiling with 'Optimize Code'. The garbage collector in C# can be quite aggressive and can dispose of an object even before finishing a call to a member function of that object (it becomes eligible for collection immediately after the access of member data).

Specific example: https://github.com/migueldeicaza/TensorFlowSharp/blob/master/TensorFlowSharp/Tensor.cs#L1391
At the point that FetchMultiDimensionalArray is called, there are no further references to TFTensor members. If the external caller of GetValue doesn't ensure the lifetime of the TFTensor extends beyond the call, then the TFTensor can be cleaned up (leading to disposal and invalidation of the the native Tensor handle) while FetchMultiDimensionalArray is still running.

**To Reproduce**
In any example code with fairly a large output tensor (to increase likelihood of garbage collection kicking in during memory copy from native to managed code), use this code to run the graph and access the output tensor data and ensure there are no further references to the returned TFTensor:
`

            var runner = someSession.GetRunner();

            runner.AddInput(someInput, someInputValue);

            var outputTensor = runner.Run(someOp);

            var outputValue = (float[,,])outputTensor.GetValue();

            // workaround: GC.KeepAlive(outputTensor)
`
Then compile with 'Optimize Code' enabled.

**Expected behavior**
This should work fine.
Instead, I reliably observe AccessViolationException occurring at random points during the call to GetValue (as the collection kicks in during Copy calls within FetchMultiDimensionalArray).

**Other context**
Easy fix would be adding GC.KeepAlive(this) to the end of GetValue (and any methods that use native resources the same way) as per: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/code-quality/ca2115-call-gc-keepalive-when-using-native-resources",NA,FALSE,https://api.github.com/repos/migueldeicaza/TensorFlowSharp,https://api.github.com/repos/migueldeicaza/TensorFlowSharp/issues/419/labels{/name},https://api.github.com/repos/migueldeicaza/TensorFlowSharp/issues/419/comments,https://api.github.com/repos/migueldeicaza/TensorFlowSharp/issues/419/events,https://github.com/migueldeicaza/TensorFlowSharp/issues/419,NA

Also, with that much time spent on teaching the network, there is small margin of time you can spend on retraining because of versioning issues between tensorsharp and what you used in python !

Hi! i have a pre-trained TF model with a input like this:

inputs['inputs'] tensor_info:
dtype: DT_STRING
shape: unknown_rank
name: tf_example:0

Im trying to create a TFTensor input in c# to evaluate the model but i cant find how to do that.
Basically iam using the TFTensor.CreateString(byte[] buffer) but when i try to run de graph y recive the following error:

""TFException: slice index 0 of dimension 0 out of bounds""

Code:

`
 byte[] pixelsByte;

        {
            pixelsByte = texture.EncodeToJPG();

When I am opening the detect scene using my own model, it should start detecting the custom objects for which I have trained it. Those custom objects are unique, but I will be including an image it in folder test for testing purposes

First of all, I replaced the original libtensorflow.dll with a GPU version, and it runs well in some machines, but not work in one machine with Titan Xp.  Though I don't think it is caused by the difference of GPU, but I can not find out the root cause.
Code is like this:

                var tensor = new TFTensor(content);
                var image_height = new TFTensor(height);
                var image_width = new TFTensor(width);

                var runner = _session_scale.GetRunner();
                runner.AddInput(_input_scale, tensor);
                runner.AddInput(_image_height_scale, image_height);
                runner.AddInput(_image_width_scale, image_width);
                runner.Fetch(_output_scale, _scale);

                return scaled;

But When I run this code in machine with K80, no problem.
The exception is like this:

I've been profiling my code by programmatically recording millisecond timings. We've created a CAE.pb file and it seems to run properly, and the time that the session.run() call is made in rapid succession (using the same session each time), the time it takes decreases (up to a certain point). Specifically, when I process the first image takes 1400ms, second image 1150ms, third image 900ms... at the 7th our 8th image it levels off at 350ms per image processing. The problem is that this speed increase only increases if I push images to TensorFlow in rapid succession. If I pause for more than approx 350ms, then the time it takes to process the next image (with the same session being reused the whole time), jumps back up to 1400ms. I'm assuming that the decreasing time is due to autotune running. However, autotune seems to ""forget"" it's session values if I don't keep it running and fed with new data constantly. Am I doing something wrong or is this a bug? Is there a RunOption or SessionOption that I'm unaware of that controls how long until autotune (or what I'm presuming is autotune) ""forgets""? :P

Note: Unlike in Issue #330 and #345, I'm being very careful to reuse my session.

I see this message every time I run my executable code which loads a PB model and does some inferencing. No problems so far. I am just curios if this error message has any signficance or should I ignore it.

Assuming that I am restricted to Windows , do you see any problems if I delete these folders?  My initial tests seem to indicate that this should be fine. Just checking with all of you.

For FRCNN, there is an example in the TensorflowSharp GitHub repo that shows how to run/fetch this model.  For Retinanet, I tried modifying the code but nothing seems to work.  I have a model summary for Retinanet that I've tried to work from, but it's not obvious to me what should be used.  The problem appears to be the parameters for the ""Fetch"" portion of the Runner.

For FRCNN, the graph is run in this way:

   ```
     var runner = m_session.GetRunner();

        runner
            .AddInput(m_graph[""image_tensor""][0], tensor)
            .Fetch(
            m_graph[""detection_boxes""][0],
            m_graph[""detection_scores""][0],
            m_graph[""detection_classes""][0],
            m_graph[""num_detections""][0]);

           var output = runner.Run();

            var boxes = (float[,,])output[0].GetValue(jagged: false);
            var scores = (float[,])output[1].GetValue(jagged: false);
            var classes = (float[,])output[2].GetValue(jagged: false);
            var num = (float[])output[3].GetValue(jagged: false);

```

From the model summary for FRCNN, it is obvious what the input (""image_tensor"") and outputs (""detection_boxes"", ""detection_scores"", ""detection_classes"", and ""num_detections"") are.  They are not the same for Retinanet (I've tried), and I can't figure out what they should be.  The ""Fetch"" part of the code above is causing a crash, and I'm guessing its because I'm not getting the node names right.

I won't paste the entire Retinanet summary here, but here is the first few nodes:

```

EDIT:

To dig a little further into this, I found a python function to print the operation names from a .pb file.  When doing this for the FRCNN .pb file, it clearly gave the output node names, as can be seen below (only posting the last several lines from the output of the python function).

```

If I do the same thing for the Retinanet .pb file, it's not obvious what the outputs are.  Here's the last several lines from the python function.

```
    def printTensors(pb_file):
    
        # read pb into graph_def
        with tf.gfile.GFile(pb_file, ""rb"") as f:
            graph_def = tf.GraphDef()
            graph_def.ParseFromString(f.read())
    
        # import graph_def
        with tf.Graph().as_default() as graph:
            tf.import_graph_def(graph_def)
    
        # print operations
        for op in graph.get_operations():
            print(op.name)


```
Hope this helps.

If I can get this working, I'll gladly share my code for training Retinanet in Keras (which is actually transfer learning on my custom objects) and for running the inference of that model in TensorflowSharp.  In my python testing, Retinanet clearly outperforms FRCNN.

Firstly , many thanks for creating this easy to use wrapper  C# wrapper over TF.   I have managed to create a model in PY, train and export the trained model out to file. I am able to load the model . However, I have some confusion when it comes to feeding inputs and getting the response of the trained model.

Model code in PY

```
model = Sequential()
model.add(Convolution2D(
    name=""conv1"",
    filters = 20,
    kernel_size = (5, 5),
    padding = ""same"",
    input_shape = (28, 28, 1)))

model.add(Activation(
    activation = ""relu""))
model.add(MaxPooling2D(
    name=""maxpool1"",
    pool_size = (2, 2),
    strides =  (2, 2)))
model.add(Convolution2D(
    name=""conv2"",
    filters = 50,
    kernel_size = (5, 5),
    padding = ""same""))
model.add(Activation(
    activation = ""relu""))
model.add(MaxPooling2D(
    name=""maxpool2"",
    pool_size = (2, 2),
    strides = (2, 2)))
model.add(Flatten())
model.add(Dense(500))
model.add(Activation(activation = ""relu""))
nb_classe=2
model.add(Dense(nb_classes,name=""outputlayer"")) 
model.add(Activation(""softmax""))
```

C# code to feed a vector and evaluate result
```
                    var tensor = ImageToTensorGrayScale(file);
                    runner.AddInput(graph[""conv1/kernel""][0], tensor);
                    runner.Fetch(graph[""outputlayer/kernel""][0]);
                    var output=runner.Run();
                    var vecResults = output[0].GetValue();
```

The expected output from the method **Fetch** should have been an array of length 2 . However, **vecResults** is a 2d array of 500X2 items.  I suspect I am not passing the name parameter to **AddInput/Fetch** correctly.  Please could somebody point me to any available documentation on how to derive the names. 

Many thanks,
Sau

The model is trained using Keras and saved to disk as a .h5 file.

**The code:**

The operation DecodeJpeg does not return exactly the same result compared to python.

**To Reproduce**
1. Clone https://github.com/doxakis/ServeTensorflowInCSharp
2. Run app: PythonApplication
3. Run app: TensorFlowSharpInceptionV3
4. Both applications feed the graph with the image (input layer: DecodeJpeg/contents. output layer: DecodeJpeg, the pixels of the picture) and produce a file containing the output layer values.
5. Compare the files in the results folder:
- [tensorflow.txt](https://github.com/migueldeicaza/TensorFlowSharp/files/2399585/tensorflow.txt)
- [tensorflowsharp.txt](https://github.com/migueldeicaza/TensorFlowSharp/files/2399586/tensorflowsharp.txt)
6. There is small differences in the pixels, which could cause varying results between python and c# for the same graph and picture.

**Expected behavior**
The DecodeJpeg should return exactly the same result compared to python.

I have a model that takes six float values as inputs to classify. How do I pass these values into this to get a prediction from within TensorflowSharp? Here is my current code:

```
            using (var graph = new TFGraph())
            {
                graph.Import(File.ReadAllBytes(""keras_frozen.pb""));

                var runner = session.GetRunner();

                long[] shape = { 0, 6 };

                TFTensor data = new TFTensor(TFDataType.Float, shape, 10);
                //TFTensor data = new[, ,] { 
                //    { 
                //        { 0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f }, 
                //        { 1.1f, 1.1f, 1.2f, 1.3f, 1.4f, 1.4f }
                //    }
                //};

                runner.AddInput(
                        graph[""dense_9_input""][0],
                        data);

                runner.Fetch(graph[""dense_11/BiasAdd""][0]);

                var output = runner.Run();

                // Fetch the results from output:
                TFTensor result = output[0];

                var resultValue = result.GetValue();

                var se = (Single[,])result.GetValue(jagged: false);
                for (int i = 0; i < se.GetLength(0); i++)
                {
                    for (int j = 0; j < se.GetLength(1); j++)
                    {
                        Console.WriteLine(se[i, j]);
                    }
                }
            }
```

The code runs without errors but not I'm clearly passing in any actual values. 

When I pass  for example

`TFTensor data = new[, ,] { {{ 0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f }, { 1.1f, 1.1f, 1.2f, 1.3f, 1.4f, 1.4f }}};`

It throws a error

      [0, 1], otherwise it would converted to tf.float32 assuming that the range

My first goal was to load in a premade image in Unity and have the model classify it. Second step would be to use the camera feed as input .

I've looked at [this example](https://github.com/Syn-McJ/TFClassify-Unity) to get some idea what needs to be done to the camera feed, but there is a lot going on there (rotating matrices, scaling  etc.) and I was wondering if there was a more straightforward way of converting the Python Tensorflow functions (like tf.convert_to_tensor) or do I have to implement them on my own. I couldn't find anything in the documentation, but it might be my own fault.

Maybe my approach to this is also problematic, so if anyone has any ideas (has worked on Mobilenets or on a similar model that requires some input image manipulation) please let me know.

Extend the API to cover the C++  gradients of Conv2D (and Conv2DTranspose ) networks. I think this will be very beneficial to the whole community.

When I go to instantiate a new TFGraph instance, the application will report back and claim that it is unable to load the libtensorflow.dll assembly. However, unlike other similar issues, I have confirmed that the libtensorflow.dll file IS PRESENT in the bin/Debug folder. The interesting part is that when I locally run the API, this issue is nonexistent. However, after using Web Deploy 3.6 and pushing the code to an actual IIS server for debugging, the application is unable to load the assembly. In fact, even in the web deploy target server's bin/Debug folder the libtensorflow.dll is present. 

**To Reproduce**
Launch a ASP.net web API with TensorFlowSharp installed via NuGet. First run the API on your local machine to ensure that the sample code for loading a pre-trained model on the main Github is working (I'm using the same code snippet). Next publish the API to an IIS server (the server I am publishing to is in a data center so I must RDP into it). Finally, load a protobuf file of your choice with sample data and attempt to run the code. It should come back and say that the assembly libtensorflow.dll could not be loaded. 

**Expected behavior**
The application should be able to create a new instance of TFGraph.

I got so far that I can now generate PB files, know the correct input/outputs, however I am stuck in tensorflowsharp using string inputs.

I can create a valid .pb file of the iris dataset (attached). It uses the following feate_spec: 

```
{'SepalLength': FixedLenFeature(shape=(1,), dtype=tf.float32, default_value=None), 'SepalWidth': FixedLenFeature(shape=(1,), dtype=tf.float32, default_value=None), 'PetalLength': FixedLenFeature(shape=(1,), dtype=tf.float32, default_value=None), 'PetalWidth': FixedLenFeature(shape=(1,), dtype=tf.float32, default_value=None)}

 I have created a simple c# console to try and spin it up. The input should be an ""input_example_tensor"" and the output is located in ""dnn/head/predictions/probabilities"". This I discoved after alex_zu provided help using the saved_model_cli command [here](https://github.com/migueldeicaza/TensorFlowSharp/issues/265).

As far as I am aware all tensorflow estimator API's work like this.

Here comes the problem: the input_example_tensor should be of a string format which will be parsed internally by the ParseExample function. Now i am stuck. I have found TFTensor.CreateString, but this doesn't solve the problem.

I am trying to build a sequence to float model. The model is defined as under:

```
def model():
    model = Sequential()
    model.add(Embedding(input_dim = vocab_size, output_dim = hidden_size, input_length = max_length, name = 'embed'))

    model.add(Activation('relu', name = 'reluActivation'))
    model.add(Dense(out_size, name = 'finalDense'))
    return model
```
The above model works perfectly when predicting directly from Tensorflow.

I converted the output model to a frozen graph so that it can be consumed by TensorflowSharp. I found the input variable to be ""embed_input"" and output variable to be ""finalDense/BiasAdd"" from the output for the trainable variables of the frozen graph. (I am not sure if this is correct, but seems to be the only options!)

From C#, I am calling the code as follows:

```

                var session = new TFSession(graph);
                var runner = session.GetRunner();
                float[] x = new float[] {106, 51, 165, 198, 59, 52, 54, 198, 59, 59, 52, 198, 57, 56, 198, 57, 59, 57, 59, 198, 54, 58, 57, 198, 57, 57, 59, 57, 59, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0};
                TFTensor tensor = new TFTensor(x);
                var a = graph.GetEnumerator();
                runner.AddInput(graph[""embed_input""][0], tensor);
                runner.Fetch(graph[""finalDense/BiasAdd""][0]);

However, I struggled a long time with batch feeding the input. Why is it not possible to just use 
 .AddInput(x, xData).AddInput(y, yData) for training? 
If I dont feed them one by one, the XOR output becomes 0.5 for each input, thus learning nothing. 
Also, reduceSum is 16 times higher than reduceMean, suggesting that maybe all entries of the 2D xData get used one by one and not row wise.

However, if it is an indirect (transitive) dependency, for example in a test project that references the main one (with `<PrivateAssets>None</PrivateAssets>`), the native binary is not copied to the output folder. 

The reason seems to be that the relative paths in TensorFlowSharp.targets file go only one level up, instead of two. This is the package structure:

```
\
 - build
      - net45
          - TensorFlowSharp.targets
- runtimes
     - win7-x64
         - libtensorflow.dll
```

So, to reach the runtimes folder, we need to go back two levels from the targets file. This change enables the native binaries to copied into output directory even when TensorFlowSharp is an indirect dependency.

I have no idea why it currently works when TensorFlowSharp is referenced directly, though.

Of course this does not compile but I'm pretty much out of my depth here in finding the correlating methods etc in TensorflowSharp.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

It works when I retrain a model from tensorflow zoo. 
I am trying to get faster detection and I wanted to experiment with YOLO model.

I am using darkflow for having YOLO working with Tensorflow. I trained my model on my custom dataset. then I froze it using the instruction on the darkflow page. I now have my PB file and a metafile, so far so good.

I then adjusted my code in the tensorflowsharp project, pointing to the just created protobuf and adapted the name of the input output variables, from:

`String[] outputs = { ""detection_boxes:0"", ""detection_scores:0"", ""detection_classes:0"", ""num_detections:0"" };
runner.AddInput(""image_tensor:0"", tensor).Fetch(outputs);
try

try
{

TensorFlow.TFException: Expects arg[0] to be float but uint8 is provided
Runner.Run() returns null.

I am not sure what the name of the output tensors are in darkflow, on the documentation I found:

> The name of input tensor and output tensor are respectively 'input' and 'output'. For further usage of this protobuf file, please refer to the official documentation of Tensorflow on C++ API here.

but I would expect different collection (tensors) as return type as it is for SSD and other models, right?

as I did not find a wrapper for ConfigProto in TensorFlowSharp I did the folowing ugly workaround :

1. 
In python 
config = tf.ConfigProto()
config.gpu_options.per_process_gpu_memory_fraction = 0.20
config.gpu_options.allow_growth = False
string1 = config.SerializeToString()
f = open('MyProto.txt','wb')
f.write(string1)
f.close()

2. In C# , when starting my session 
 var _graph = new TFGraph();
 var file = new FileReader(name_of_previous_saved_protofile);
 byte[] byteProto = File.ReadAllBytes(fileProtoName);
 IntPtr unmanagedPointer = Marshal.AllocHGlobal(byteProto.Length);
 Marshal.Copy(byteProto, 0, unmanagedPointer, byteProto.Length);
 _graph.Import(File.ReadAllBytes(modelFilename));
 var _session = new TFSession(_graph);
 TensorFlow.TFSessionOptions options = new TensorFlow.TFSessionOptions();
 TFStatus tfStat = new TFStatus();
 options.SetConfig(unmanagedPointer, byteProto.Length, tfStat);

Although in python I see that the memory settles at 30% (probably some 10% is used by windows),
when I try in CSharp, TF gets all the memory on both memory cards ....
The tfStat is ""OK"", and the libtensorflow.dll is the one from here : https://github.com/migueldeicaza/TensorFlowSharp/issues/109

I'am trying to use a retrained graph, out of tensorflows tutorial in a Unity project with the webcamtexture.
But as a first test i simply tried to Load a picture and let it run through the graph.
I basically tried what is shown in example ""ExampleInceptionInference""

I used optimize for inference and transform_graph on it (with different calls and settings, i ""collected"" some graphs)

The graphs work perfectly in python after and before each editing step (retrain, optimize and transform)
My guess is that i'am doing something wrong when i try to transform the picture to a tensor.
I'am using the code out of the example with slight changes. (W,H, Mean are different)

```
        private static void ConstructGraphToNormalizeImage(out TFGraph graph, out TFOutput input, out TFOutput output, TFDataType destinationDataType = TFDataType.Float)
        {

            const int W = 299;
            const int H = 299;
            const float Mean = 128;
            const float Scale = 1;
			graph = new TFGraph();
			input = graph.Placeholder(TFDataType.String);
            output = graph.Cast(graph.Div(
				x: graph.Sub(
                    x: graph.ResizeBilinear(
                        images: graph.ExpandDims(
                            input: graph.Cast(
                                graph.DecodeJpeg(contents: input, channels: 3), DstT: TFDataType.Float),
                            dim: graph.Const(0, ""make_batch"")),
                        size: graph.Const(new int[] { W, H }, ""size"")),
                    y: graph.Const(Mean, ""mean"")),
                y: graph.Const(Scale, ""scale"")), destinationDataType);
        }
```

I Init my class with
```
        var model = File.ReadAllBytes(Utils.getFilePath(""dnn/10k_trans_t.pb""));
        g.Import(model, """");
        labels = File.ReadAllLines(Utils.getFilePath(""dnn/retrained_labels_t.txt""));
        session = new TFSession(g);
        g_input = g[""Mul""][0];
        g_output = g[""final_result""][0];

        resultObject = ""not sure"";
        resultProb = 0;

        _file = Utils.getFilePath(""Passion.jpg"");
```

and basically after a few seconds i trigger

```
 public void HandleJPG()
    {
        
        Debug.Log($""HandlePictures {TensorPics.Count}"");
        
        var tensor = ImageUtil.CreateTensorFromImageFile(_file);
        var runner = session.GetRunner();

        runner.AddInput(g_input, tensor).Fetch(g_output);
        var output = runner.Run();

        var bestIdx = 0;
        float best = 0;
        var result = output[0];
        var rshape = result.Shape;
        var probabilities = ((float[][])result.GetValue(jagged: true))[0];
        for (int r = 0; r < probabilities.Length; r++)
        {
            if (probabilities[r] > best)
            {
                bestIdx = r;
                best = probabilities[r];
            }
        }
        Debug.Log(""Tensorflow thinks this is: "" + labels[bestIdx] + "" Prob : "" + best * 100);
  }
```

But in TensorflowSharp i get completely different results.

so in short i have two questions:
1. Has anyone a idea what has to be done differently on a retrained graph?
2. Has anyone tried to transform the webcamtexture into a TFTensor? (could also use Opencvs Mats as a helper)

Further, the solution that I posted may actually have unintended consequences related to this new issue, and may even be the cause of this issue. Or not. Hopefully someone reading this can discriminate that for me.

On to the issue. After building and running SampleTest a console window appears. My expectation is that it solves some trivial example problem and displays the solution.

Confidence: 95,5%

The overall detection rate is about 10% of that using python, with most pictures getting no detection at all, and some pictures getting just one out of three features. Also the bounding boxes vary greatly between what is detected by both python and c#.
I suspect the decoding of the jpg returns different arrays, but this needs more testing.
For python I use cv2 to load the image into a numpy array, but I get the same results with tensorflow's decode jpg function. for c# i use basically use what is given in the example.

Unfortunately I do not have time to do much more than to write an issue here and have to make a workaround with python for now.

While I am aware of the project instance against unilateral uneccessary code refactorings (e.g. #39) and I mostly agree with them, I have to say that some files would indeed benefit from at least some code style normalizations to at least enforce consistency. Right now, in the same file, it is possible to find multiple bracket styles being used (e.g. [K&R](https://github.com/migueldeicaza/TensorFlowSharp/blob/master/TensorFlowSharp/Tensorflow.cs#L54) and [Allman's](https://github.com/migueldeicaza/TensorFlowSharp/blob/master/TensorFlowSharp/Tensorflow.cs#L125)), indentation using both [spaces and tabs](https://github.com/migueldeicaza/TensorFlowSharp/blob/master/TensorFlowSharp/Tensorflow.cs#L1033-L1039), and different [rules](https://github.com/migueldeicaza/TensorFlowSharp/blob/master/TensorFlowSharp/Tensorflow.cs#L1595) [regarding](https://github.com/migueldeicaza/TensorFlowSharp/blob/master/TensorFlowSharp/Tensorflow.cs#L2379) spaces.

I know this is minimal, but if you allow me I could at least enforce the .editorconfig style I had created a while ago to solve those inconsistencies - then at least, everyone else using VS2017 would have been able to enforce the same formatting style when hitting Ctrl+E,D (or Ctrl+K, D).",NA,FALSE,https://api.github.com/repos/migueldeicaza/TensorFlowSharp,https://api.github.com/repos/migueldeicaza/TensorFlowSharp/issues/179/labels{/name},https://api.github.com/repos/migueldeicaza/TensorFlowSharp/issues/179/comments,https://api.github.com/repos/migueldeicaza/TensorFlowSharp/issues/179/events,https://github.com/migueldeicaza/TensorFlowSharp/issues/179,NA

I've been working on reconstructing the MNIST neural net found [here](http://blog.aloni.org/posts/backprop-with-tensorflow/) using the TensorFlowSharp 1.3.0 nuget package in VisualStudio 2015

I was receiving several Matrix size-incompatible exceptions when I tried to add two matrices of the same dimensions. After some tinkering, I discovered that one of my variables was being overwritten on initialization with the shape of another variable. Here is some example code highlighting the issue:
```
using (var graph = new TFGraph())
{
   TFOutput variableOneShape = graph.Const(new TFShape(784, 30).ToIntArray());
   TFOutput initialVariableOne = graph.RandomUniform(variableOneShape, TFDataType.Float);
   TFOutput variableOne;
   TFOperation variableOneInit;
   TFOutput persistentVariableOne = graph.Variable(initialVariableOne, out variableOneInit, out variableOne, ""Var1"");
   TFOutput variableTwoShape = graph.Const(new TFShape(1, 30).ToIntArray());
   TFOutput initialVariableTwo = graph.RandomUniform(variableTwoShape, TFDataType.Float);
   TFOutput variableTwo;
   TFOperation variableTwoInit;
   TFOutput persistentVariableTwo = graph.Variable(initialVariableTwo, out variableTwoInit, out variableTwo, ""Var2"");

   using (TFSession session = new TFSession(graph))
   {
       session.GetRunner().AddTarget(variableOneInit).Run();
       session.GetRunner().AddTarget(variableTwoInit).Run();
       TFSession.Runner debugFetcher = session.GetRunner()
                                     .Fetch(initialVariableOne)
                                     .Fetch(variableOne)
                                     .Fetch(initialVariableTwo)
                                     .Fetch(variableTwo);
       TFTensor[] result = debugFetcher.Run();
       TFTensor returnedInitialVariableOne = result[0];
       TFTensor returnedVariableOne = result[1];
       TFTensor returnedInitialVariableTwo = result[2];
       TFTensor returnedVariableTwo = result[3];

}
```

Save off the *.pb file (From what i can gather, that is all i need)
In C#:
Create Graph, a Session, Input Variables, Input Values, and Outputs to run the model.
Run the model, then interrogate the output.

The most challenging part for me is constructing the InputVariables, InputValues, and Output. The construction patterns, and instance usages for those objects are befuddling me to say the least.

I assume I am not seeing a pattern in the examples, or that I am fighting the naming conventions, or... I don't know what I am missing... And I can't be the only person struggling with this.

The python code is attached. It's a simple linear regression model I ripped off from a stanford class and made more portable.

    var session = new TFSession(graph);

It's telling me my output needs to be of type `float` which internally, (I believe), maps to: `DT_FLOAT`.
How do I do that?

'char-rnn-tensorflow to Tensorflowsharp', but I don't know how to get the state and feed the state in .pb model 

Hello, I tried to use RNN model in tensorflowSharp, but I have some problems to use it
This is a model what i used. [link](https://github.com/sherjilozair/char-rnn-tensorflow)

1. I trained this model and made it into a single pb file (freeze graph)

Gist Import GraphDef result
[link](https://gist.github.com/hjh010501/5a78be6a6fadad9094ad5baad78c7d6d)

2.  I analyzed char-rnn-tensorflow model.py and change model.py into tensorflowsharp version
BUT, I can't know how to change this code (model.py)


```
 self.initial_state = cell.zero_state(args.batch_size, tf.float32)
        ...
     outputs, last_state = legacy_seq2seq.rnn_decoder(inputs, self.initial_state, cell, loop_function=loop if not training else None, scope='rnnlm')
        ...
     state = sess.run(self.cell.zero_state(1, tf.float32))
        ...
     feed = {self.input_data: x, self.initial_state: state} 
                 [state] = sess.run([self.final_state], feed) 
        ...
                 [probs, state] = sess.run([self.probs, self.final_state], feed)
```


I tried to input input_data to input node(Placeholder) and output the result data in output node(output) but I got strange result... I think I failed to feed rnn cell's state data

my C# code: [link](https://gist.github.com/hjh010501/0a14f34a850e9e1311b0ae08fc54d760)

How can i input the state and output the state in model?

I've noticed that the ```TFGraph``` class includes many operations from the tf.nn python modules, such as ELU, [Relu](https://migueldeicaza.github.io/TensorFlowSharp/api/TensorFlow/TensorFlow.TFGraph.html#TensorFlow_TFGraph_Relu_TensorFlow_TFOutput_System_String_), and TanH.

However, I couldn't help but notice that the [tf.nn.dropout](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/nn/dropout) operation is not present there (yet?).

Being that this is quite a ubiquitous operation in most modern deep learning applications, I guess it is available somewhere else, but I couldn't find yet where its precise location is right now. If that is the case, sorry for the stupid question, but may I ask where it could be found?

This is not actually an issue but rather a question. This might be a stupid question actually, but how do I convert a TFTensor or a TFInput to a TFOutput such that I can use in TFGraph.MatMul()?

To give a concrete example, let's say I have a method that accepts a TFInput, as well as a ```TFTensor``` field in my class called ```kernel```, what do I have to do so that I can use it in some way similar to:

```csharp
public TFOutput Call(TFInput inputs)
{
    TFOutput output = Graph.MatMul(inputs, this.kernel));
    return output;
}
```

and still have it compile? Right now I am getting errors ""Cannot convert from TensorFlow.TFTensor to TensorFlow.TFOutput"" with the code above, though I am pretty sure its because I have not understood completely how to mix those two together.

[1] It has been claimed that Most of the C Api has been ported and exposed through Tensorflowsharp
=> What is the best way to move on to the 3_Nueral Network Models?  
=> Are we ready to just read through what have been ported to Basic Models and start porting the Neural Network python codes to TensorflowSharp?
=> We still have some bugs with SimpleTest. The **AttributeTest fails**. Is it relevant to prevent us for further porting? 
=> I have download the **latest Widows DLL with TF_NEWWHILE exposed**. Running it still results in TF_WHILEFINISH **error**.

If this is correct I expect there are other places where the ref [] pattern needs to be fixed (I just did the one causing SampleTest to fail). btw I also wondered if these pointers should be handled as unsafe but the post below says no...

UPDATE  I just noticed that the unsafe declaration is in the DllImport (static extern unsafe void TF_GraphGetTensorShape...) so yeah, I think this is the correct fix. Certainly the old code which passed a ref to the array won't work as the C code would have to allocate and return a C# managed object. Also this works :)

This fixes a memory violation running SampleTest, for extern C arrays are passed directly, not via ref which requires C to create a managed object.

As far as I can tell, the only difference between these two branches is the casting of top (a long) to int and its subsequent assignment to itop. However, these variables are only used in a for loop with an int counter.

This leaves me with two questions:

1) Is this branching necessary? Seems like we could just always use int for both ""top"" and the loop counter. I don't think there's support for arrays with more than Int32.MaxValue dimension in .Net. That said, throwing a ""too long array"" exception might also be acceptable, since this simply ignoring a chunk of the data also seems bad. I don't know tensorflow well enough to comment on the appropriate API behavior here.

`TFTensor.GetValue` appears to be transposing multidimensional arrays.

Specifically, I believe that [`FetchMultiDimensionalArray`](/migueldeicaza/TensorFlowSharp/blob/master/TensorFlowSharp/Tensor.cs#L821) is updating the `target` array in column major order, whereas `data` is [documented](/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/c/c_api.h#L183) to be in row major order.

**Version Used:**

Library | Version
------------ | -------------
libtensorflow.dll | r1 (local Windows cmake build)
TensorFlowSharp.dll | 39eb920ee213e0f6a67925e9429b3c7723963173

**Reproduction:**

The following program effectively roundtrips a 2-D array:

```csharp
public static void Main(string[] args)
{
    var graph = new TFGraph();
    var input = graph.Placeholder(TFDataType.Int32);
    var output = graph.Identity(input);
    using (var session = new TFSession(graph))
    {
        var expected = new int[,] {{0, 1}, {2, 3}};

        var runner = session.GetRunner();
        runner.AddInput(input, expected).Fetch(output);

        var actual = (int[,])runner.Run()[0].GetValue();

        Console.WriteLine($""Expected: {RowOrderJoin(expected)}""); // 0, 1, 2, 3
        Console.WriteLine($""Actual:   {RowOrderJoin(actual)}"");   // 0, 2, 1, 3
    }
}
private static string RowOrderJoin(Array array) => String.Join("", "", array.Cast<int>());
```

**Expected Behaviour:**

The `expected` and `actual` arrays are equivalent.

**Actual Behaviour:**

The `actual` array appears to be transposed.

Similarly, the Java API exposes a ""Runner()"" method that surfaces a wrapper class that keeps track of the various inputs, outputs and targets.

because everything works very well, I would like to reach the next step in my requirements to connect multiple databases with identical schemes.

Hopefully I learned and understand more about the concept behind Dotmim.Sync and I read all relevant issue posts about this question.

I just want to confirm my conclusions:

* For now it is not possible to build a sync structure with multiple servers to the same client, even if the clients never pushes data?

Because ideal for me would be multiple server dbs each having a seperate import db, but some data should be pushed to the same online export db.

* To solve that, it would need one big server which controls all pulls and pushes, because you implemented here a client-server only solution, right?

This would be not easy to handle for me, because it would result easy in a 50+ GB size and I would have to change a lot of processes.

Further I had a 2 day research about the possilities for a peer-to-peer solution, which brought me to MS Sync Framework 2.1, which seems not to be developed any further. So it seems to be not a good choice anymore.

But I wonder why it's not developed any further and why my research for alternatives are surprisingly sparse, even in the commercial sector.

Do you have plans for the future to go in a peer-to-peer direction?

How big you estimate would be the efforts to implement in Dotmim.Sync to a peer-to-peer functionalty?
I would give it both thumbs up and do my best to support that.

Hmm, I see now my questions might be better asked under discussions, sorry for that mistake.

DMS creates the local SQLite database, usually as a copy of the SQL Server database, over http. In this case the local SQLite database is not completed by DMS. It has only a single table `scope_info` showing the value `DefaultScope`, then it throws this exception.

We have `DMS 0.8.0` on the client and the web server. Rebooting the client PC didn't help. We've also cleaned up and restarted the web server in case there were resource issues there. This issue has since been replicated on another machine trying to do a new install.

What a great piece of software, I have been looking for since month. Thank you a lot!
It solved all my tasks in days, with previous solutions I struggled for months with problems.

Some newbie questions are left and it would be very kind if you confirm my learnings:

* The best way to insert FK referenced tables at once is with `SyncOptions DisableConstaints = true` right?
* To filter rows in a range of value the approach is  `.AddCustomWhere` ?

* **How to get the progress in a WinForms app**?
Because I work with GUI and EF Core async/await is no option for me in my project, but with:

```
SyncResult syncResult = Task<SyncResult>.Run(() => 
    agent.SynchronizeAsync(syncType) // ,progress
    ).Result; 
```

everything works perfect, clean and stable, but when I try to get the progress:

```
// Using the IProgress<T> pattern to handle progression during the synchronization
var progress = new SynchronousProgress<ProgressArgs>(s => 
	Console.WriteLine($""{s.PogressPercentageString}:\t{s.Source}:\t{s.Message}"")
);
```
the syncResult process runs forever and never calls back, neither an console output is visible. Which is not a huge problem because it's so amazing fast.

Would you recommend some improvements in my case?

Besides: There is a small typo in `ProgressArgs.PogressPercentageString` should be `ProgressArgs.ProgressPercentageString`.

First of all I have to say that I'm quite new to C# .Net programming so I might be missing obvious solutions, but...
Is there a way to skip type checking columns in the schema that are not included in the sync?

What I'm trying to do:
`DatabaseA ----downloadonly----> DatabaseB`

`DatabaseA` is a vendor database that I cannot modify, `DatabaseB` is a database that I use in my application.
DatabaseA has a table (Table1) with a lot of columns, but two of which are `text` columns. But let's say there are 4 columns: 
```sql
Id as int, 
Name as nvarchar,
Emailaddress as nvarchar, 
Info as text
```
I only need the first 3 columns.
So this is my code.

```c#
...
var serverProvider = new SqlSyncProvider(Configuration.GetConnectionString(""DatabaseA""));
var clientProvider = new SqlSyncProvider(Configuration.GetConnectionString(""DatabaseB""));

var setup = new SyncSetup(new string[] { ""Table1"" });
setup.Tables[""Table1""].Columns.AddRange(new string[] { ""Id"", ""Name"", ""Emailaddress"" });
setup.Tables[""Table1""].SyncDirection = SyncDirection.DownloadOnly;

var agent = new SyncAgent(clientProvider, serverProvider, setup);

progress = new SynchronousProgress<ProgressArgs>(args =>
    Log.Information($""{args.PogressPercentageString}:\t{args.Source}:\t{args.Message}""));

var result = new SyncResult();

do {
   result = await agent.SynchronizeAsync(progress);
} while (Console.ReadKey().Key != ConsoleKey.Escape);
...
```

My assumption was that all other columns would be ignored, but this fails:
```

New columns are not syncing to my local database from my main server (new tables are syncing fine). Can you please check what I am doing wrong. 
1. Main server: SQL Server
2. Local server: Sqlite 

I have created an asp net core application to sync database. There I have created 2 methods to Provision and Deprovison, here is the code: 

```
 [HttpGet]
        [Route(""provision"")]
        public async Task PovisionAsync()
        {
            // Get Orchestrator 
            WebServerOrchestrator orchestrator = _webServerManager.GetOrchestrator(""DefaultScope"");

            //var progress = new Progress<ProgressArgs>(pa => Debug.WriteLine($""{pa.Context.SyncStage}\t {pa.Message}""));

            // get the server scope (and Create the table if needed)
            ServerScopeInfo serverScope = await orchestrator.GetServerScopeAsync();

            SyncSet newSchema = await orchestrator.ProvisionAsync(SyncProvision.StoredProcedures | SyncProvision.Triggers | SyncProvision.TrackingTable);

            serverScope.Schema = newSchema;

            // save the server scope
            await orchestrator.WriteServerScopeAsync(serverScope);

        }

        [HttpGet]
        [Route(""deprovision"")]
        public async Task DeprovisionAsync()
        {

            // Get Orchestrator 
            WebServerOrchestrator orchestrator = _webServerManager.GetOrchestrator(""DefaultScope"");

            //var progress = new Progress<ProgressArgs>(pa => Debug.WriteLine($""{pa.Context.SyncStage}\t {pa.Message}""));

            // get the server scope (and Create the table if needed)
            ServerScopeInfo serverScope = await orchestrator.GetServerScopeAsync();

            // Deprovision everything
            await orchestrator.DeprovisionAsync(SyncProvision.StoredProcedures
                | SyncProvision.Triggers | SyncProvision.TrackingTable);

            // Affect good values
            serverScope.Setup = null;
            serverScope.Schema = null;

            // save the server scope
            await orchestrator.WriteServerScopeAsync(serverScope);

        }
```

Now on my Desktop application I have also created 2 methods to provision and deprovision, here is the code: 

```
 private static async Task DeprovisionClientManuallyAsync()
        {
            SqliteConnectionStringBuilder sqlitebuilder = new SqliteConnectionStringBuilder
            {
                DataSource = AppDomain.CurrentDomain.GetData(""DataDirectory"").ToString() + @""\Medlogic.db""
            };
            // Create client provider
            SqliteSyncProvider clientProvider = new SqliteSyncProvider(sqlitebuilder.ConnectionString);

            // Create standard Setup and Options
            SyncSetup setup = new SyncSetup(new string[] { ""Products"" });
            SyncOptions options = new SyncOptions();

            // Create a local orchestrator used to Deprovision everything
            LocalOrchestrator localOrchestrator = new LocalOrchestrator(clientProvider, options, setup);

            // Deprovision everything
            await localOrchestrator.DeprovisionAsync(SyncProvision.StoredProcedures | SyncProvision.Triggers | SyncProvision.TrackingTable);

            var clientScope = await localOrchestrator.GetClientScopeAsync();

            // Affect good values
            clientScope.Setup = null;
            clientScope.Schema = null;

            // save the server scope
            await localOrchestrator.SaveClientScopeAsync(clientScope);

        }

        private static async Task ProvisionClientManuallyAsync()
        {
            SqliteConnectionStringBuilder sqlitebuilder = new SqliteConnectionStringBuilder
            {
                DataSource = AppDomain.CurrentDomain.GetData(""DataDirectory"").ToString() + ""/Medlogic.db""
            };
            SqliteSyncProvider clientProvider = new SqliteSyncProvider(sqlitebuilder.ConnectionString);
            // Create standard Setup and Options
            SyncSetup setup = new SyncSetup(new string[] { ""Products"" });
            SyncOptions options = new SyncOptions();
            // Create a local orchestrator used to provision everything locally
            LocalOrchestrator localOrchestrator = new LocalOrchestrator(clientProvider, options, setup);

            await localOrchestrator.ProvisionAsync(SyncProvision.StoredProcedures | SyncProvision.Triggers | SyncProvision.TrackingTable);

            var clientScope = await localOrchestrator.GetClientScopeAsync();

            // Affect good values
            clientScope.Setup = null;
            clientScope.Schema = null;

            // save the server scope
            await localOrchestrator.SaveClientScopeAsync(clientScope);

        }
```

Here is what I am doing: 

1.  I added a new table in my main SQL server and then I press ""Sync Now"" button from my desktop application. New Database table is successfully added to my local database as expected. 
2. I added a new column ""Default_Markup"" in my ""Products"" table. 
3. Then I used fidler to hit my webapi created using net core application 
       a . First I hit the DeProvision API (Status is OK)
       b. Then I hit the Provision API (Status is OK)
4. Then I hit DeProvision and Provision methods from my desktop application (these methods are shown above and written in same applicaiton). 
5. Then I pressed the ""Sync Now"" button from my desktop application.  

Now I am getting this error: 
![SyncError](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22783551/114545973-3db2c000-9c7a-11eb-80c4-8aa5bb3af753.png)

Also column is not updated in the database. Please let me know if I am doing something wrong. 

I have also tried to Reinitialize, but still giving me same error:

` SyncResult s1 = await agent.SynchronizeAsync(SyncType.Reinitialize);`

Some Questions: 

1. Do we need to hit Provision and Deprovision from both web server and desktop application whenever we made any changes into Main database. 
2. I have multiple clients using the desktop application do we need to run Provision and Deprovision from each client's application?

The app we have in production, not using DMS, takes 15-20mins to sync to a new device with the same test data.

The issue does not seem to be related to indexes as the snapshot is already created. The server we use for testing now appears to have sufficient resources. We use batch size=2000 as I assume a smaller batch size is more resilient.

The exception is probably irrelevant for you, however I would like to identify, what causes the exception in our solution.
The last version, that works normally, is version 0.6.3-beta-0540. I went trough commits that were done 20 or more days ago to see, what has changed but was unable to find anything, that could help me solve our issue. Any ideas on your side maybe?

Also, it would be great, if you would tag the releases. :)

Today I continue with tests of this great tool and I am in the part of the prefixes in the tables and stored procedures, before doing this step, I did a Deprovision (Client and Server) so that everything was clean.

I made this simple code indicated by the documentation

My Code:
if the tables, stored procedures, were generated from the Azure database side, but not from the SQLExpress

```
string serverConnectionString = ""Azure DB"";
string clientConnectionString = ""SQLExpress"";

var serverProvider = new SqlSyncChangeTrackingProvider(serverConnectionString);
var clientProvider = new SqlSyncProvider(clientConnectionString);

 var tables = new string[] { ""Accounts"", ""AccountSettings"", ""Companies"" };
 var options = new SyncOptions();
var setup = new SyncSetup(tables)
{
    StoredProceduresPrefix = ""Sync"",
    TrackingTablesPrefix = ""Sync"",
    TriggersPrefix = ""Sync"",
};

var agent = new SyncAgent(clientProvider, serverProvider, options, setup);
var s2 = await agent.SynchronizeAsync();

// Write results
Console.WriteLine(s2);
```

            agent.SynchronizeAsync()

The result: 
1. `scope_info_history` and `scope_info_server` tables created in mysql
2.  exception syncing Orders table's rows:

	(`O' at line 38)_ 

Questions:
1. Why such error?
2. Is there any way to display the full insert command(without defining `Interceptors` becuase i find it a little complicated)?

Since I will be running this code on an Azure server I need to make sure that all requests are handled within that 230 second period, eventhough this might make the whole process longer. Because of this I have a couple of question to know if it could aid in making sure the 230 limit is not hit.

Is there anything we can do on the server database that speeds things up? 
Does the batch size on the server matter in speeding up the request time, or does it only matter for the time needed for the whole process?
Same question for the client.

I was able to time out the server in my tests by sending a lot of client changes, which is a situation that could realistically happen when a user is offline for some period (and can't sync as a result). Does the client batch size matter for this situation?

I have been testing on a test server (duh :)) which is not the most powerful server in the world, far from it :) What would benefit the sync framework more: more power to the sql database, or more power for the webserver itself? As far as I understand the framework I think that the webserver itself is the bottleneck, correct? So upscaling the cpu it has available would speed up the sync.

Some tables will rarely change and I am supplying the clients with the current values. This means that initially these tables don't really need to sync. Is there any way to mark a record as the same as the server? 
I have noticed that when I extended my tests to contain those tables as well, the time it needed for that initial sync went up although it doesn't really need to sync anything. I figured that checking those table was the extra time needed (5 tables, +- 250 records combined)

I will be bringing the code up & running in a pool of around 8000 possible clients (it is opt-in) and am trying to keep the possibility of failure as low as possible :)

Well, I am not so happy with INSERT OR REPLACE in SQLite, as this means, that we cannot have any additional rows in the sqlite database that are not synchronized.

Isn't there an INSERT OR UPDATE variant as well?

It could, for example, be necessary, to have an additonal column in the client database, that does not exist on the server, nor is it synchronized.
When you now run INSERT OR REPLACE and the row already exists localls, REPLACE would just overwrite the existing row like DELETE AND INSERT)

Thus, our local column would be cleared!


There is a new syntax in Sqlite allowing an UPSERT mode, using a macro `INSERT INTO T VALUES() ON CONFLICT() DO UPDATE` : https://www.sqlite.org/lang_UPSERT.html

To be honest, I think I've already tried this technic, but in my memories, I had some problem with the different tables joins and where clauses.
But once again, it's a bit old, and I just don't remember exactly what happened...
Not sure it can be applied in our scenario, but we can try (again? ) I guess :)

Mitigation on `update_scope_id`

I get your point on the `[side].[update_scope_id] <> @sync_scope_id` 
Basically this condition is mostly used on the server side.
If I want to rephrase it, It basically says to the server (from a client perspective) : 

**Please don't send me back the changes I just sent to you, because we know that they are already in sync, since ... I just sent these changes to you server, and you applied them correctly :)**

Indeed, from a client perspective, this condition is never matched, because all the rows that have different scope id than `0000-000` (server) or `Null` (local client) are coming from others scope and should not be sent back to the server, for any reason.

Since the `SyncSqliteProvider` is marked as `CanBeServerProvider => false;`, we know that **Sqlite** will never be used as a Server Database.
So far, I guess we can remove this condition in the `Select_Changes` command.

The only concern I have is that this problem (timestamp got messed up on the client side) is applying to **MySql** as well, since the timestamp is generated based on the datetime clock as well...

I will try to remove the sql condition on Sqlite and see if all tests continue to pass.
If there is no problem or regression, it will be available in `v0.6.2`

Will keep you updated.

I have many local orchestrators, with the same scope, that can be execute concurrent batch syncronizations, and with different sync parameters.

Looking in the source code it seems that for each request the WebServerOrchestrator first sets context and after gets the context while manages the request. Can this behavior have side effects for concurrent syncronizations?

If there is no sync, call's duration is 10-20 ms. But this can increase 10-15 sec during sync. I think this is because sync transaction blocks the server database. Then I used READ_COMMITTED_SNAPSHOT = ON option, but this option doesn't help.
If 30 clients syncronize every 10 minutes, the server will be blocked all the time.

What If client database already have same table structure and other point if client table have same  structure and data.
is syncing possible or i need to drop all the table or i should clear all the data.

- source db SqlServer
- destination db Sqlite

- Could not reproduce on other environments/databases.
- On the same environment, i could reproduce it also for SqlServer destination db

Issue:
- When triggering the initial sync, schema is correctly replicated on destination db
- When trying to sync the rows, an insert statement runs trying to insert a NULL value in a non nullable column (which obviously has value on the source db (column type: bit not null)

  Mitigation:
  - I tried clearing the change tracking cache on the source db => did not work
  - i tried disabling and enabling change tracking on the source db => did not work

  We could not identify a root cause.
  We are currently running with 0.6.0 and the issue is not reproducing anymore, but still it would be nice to identify/reproduce the issue in order to lower the stability concerns.

Each of our customers has a database with an ~identical schema. Some of our customers have been with us for over 20 years. We are investigating DMS as we move our customers to SQL Server (via web api) and SQLite on the client

If we were to create snapshots of our customer databases, they would reflect the current state. Is that correct? How do we create snapshots for historical data so that we can sync server data to client machines?

An alternative I've considered is to recurse the object hierarchy to sync the tables one at the time. I did this to sync initial client data to the server. Now the challenge is to get that server data to other clients in the same company.

We already pass the database name to the sync controller, so I tried also passing an optional table name. I reconfigured the sync agent on the client to take an optional tableName parameter, like this
```
string serviceUri = $""{SyncApi}?databaseName={DatabaseName}&tableName={tableName}"";
if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(tableName))
    serviceUri = $""{SyncApi}?databaseName={DatabaseName}"";

WebClientOrchestrator webClientOrchestrator = new WebClientOrchestrator(serviceUri);

SyncAgent syncAgent = new SyncAgent(clientProvider, webClientOrchestrator, syncOptions);
if (!string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(tableName))
{
    string[] tables = new string[] { tableName };
    syncAgent = new SyncAgent(clientProvider, webClientOrchestrator, syncOptions, tables);
}
```

I have modified the sync controller similarly
```
string[] tables = new string[] { tableName };
orchestrator.Setup = new SyncSetup(tables);
```

This syncs the correct tables without error on the client nor the server, but no data is returned. I also note no tracking tables are created on the client.

Startup on the web api is configured like this
```
SyncOptions syncOptions = new SyncOptions();
syncOptions.BatchSize = 2000;
syncOptions.UseBulkOperations = true;
services.AddSyncServer<SqlSyncChangeTrackingProvider>(myConnectionString, new SyncSetup(), syncOptions);
```
If we can't use snapshots with historical data, how to we configure DMS to sync one table at a time?

I am using Web API to expose my database to my client systems. There are filters on all the tables so that only the relevant information gets sent down to the clients. Luckily, there is only one parameter. The server setup is pretty straight forward affair:

```csharp
services.AddMemoryCache();

var setup = new SyncSetup(SyncSetupHelper.tables);
var options = new SyncOptions();
SyncSetupHelper.AddFilters(setup);

services.AddSyncServer<SqlSyncChangeTrackingProvider>(connectionString, setup);
```

When testing this setup with a Console (.net core), I am not having any issues with syncing with the server (the same code is being used in both Xamarin and Console app):

```csharp
var serverOrchestrator = new WebClientOrchestrator(""https://c8fc559e2d5f.ngrok.io/api/sync"");
var clientProvider = new SqliteSyncProvider(clientConnectionString);
var agent = new SyncAgent(clientProvider, serverOrchestrator);
if (!agent.Parameters.Contains(""Id""))
{
    var filterId = new Guid(""5D25A2C1-209F-44F7-842C-CFD9D47864DE"");
    agent.Parameters.Add(""Id"", filterId);
}
do
{
    var s1 = await agent.SynchronizeAsync();
    Console.WriteLine(s1);
} while (Console.ReadKey().Key != ConsoleKey.Escape);
Console.WriteLine(""End"");
```

EDIT 2: Another sync exception that sometimes throws when there are many rows is `The page was not displayed because the request entity is too large.`

I'm working on an android application that needs to sync data from a web server using SQL Server to Sqlite. I've been testing a scenario, which should be working judging by the documentation. I added an existing column to a table in the **sync setup** and ran the sync using SyncType.Normal. I was expecting to see the column sync to the client device, but instead it resulted in an updated schema, but all the rows were lost. If I run this using SyncType.Reinitialize it works, but for us, downloading everything again for such small changes is not an option.

Is this working as intended or is it a bug?

Also, if this is working as predicted, would a valid solution to this problem be, to have a custom API that would handle these changes (eg. update the schema, and insert data for all existing records) on app update, and then use a new version of DMS setup to sync from then on?

I have a MariaDB Database that I want to sync with a SQLite database.

I couldn't figure out why and how this error happens, so I think it is probably an issue with the sync framework itself.

It runs `exec [dbo].[xxxx_selectrow] @ID=123456,@sync_scope_id=NULL`  consecutive on client side as you can see below:

Which has lock on table. Other tables are ok but this one is impacting sync process.
Is there any settings to help me out?

That part is working well using the syncConfig to set the direction of each table.

My question, is that for the download (from server to client), I don't actually want to delete records that have been deleted on the server. Right now, if I add or delete a record on the server, it will sync that change to the client - and in my case, I would like to keep the record on the client, even if the server deleted the record.

        sqlConnectionStringBuilder.InitialCatalog = dbName;
        provider.ConnectionString = sqlConnectionStringBuilder.ConnectionString;

```

**EDIT 3.** The databases are all copies of a database that we initialise for each region. However the schemas may diverge as our app evolves and our customers have different versions of the app and different version of the DB. I try to update the `WebServerOrchestrator `with the new list of tables like this
```
string sql = ""SELECT name FROM sys.tables"";
List<string> tableList = new List<string>();
myConnection.Open();
using (SqlCommand command = new SqlCommand(sql, myConnection))
{
    using (SqlDataReader reader = command.ExecuteReader())
    {
        while (reader.Read())
        {
            string tableName = reader.GetString(0);
            if (tableName.Substring(0, 3) != ""sys"")
                tableList.Add(tableName);
        }
    }
}
string[] tables = tableList.ToArray();
orchestrator.Setup = new SyncSetup(tables);

```
which seems not to upset the server.

On the client we have
```
SqliteConnection sqliteConnection = GetSQLiteConnection();
SqliteSyncProvider clientProvider = new SqliteSyncProvider(sqliteConnection.ConnectionString);
syncAgent = new SyncAgent(clientProvider, serverOrchestrator);
```

**EDIT 5.**  `SyncResult syncResult = await syncAgent.SynchronizeAsync();` seems happy enough and local SQLite db is created. Will post further results s I go.

Still keen to hear from others who have gone down this road.

**EDIT 6.**  Changed `SyncController` to filter out DMS tables
```
if (tableName.IndexOf(""sys"") == -1 && tableName.IndexOf(""scope_"") == -1)
    tableList.Add(tableName);
```
and hey ho it works! Switching databases and syncing 38 tables at amazing speed.

I have a SQL Server server and a Sqlite client (on iOS).  I'm using the WebProxy method for getting and retrieving data.  I'm also using Filters.

The initial sync works great, lots of Stored Procedures are (re-)created on the SQL Server and data is sync'd to Sqlite.  All is working as expected.  I can view the data in the local sqlite database.

I then add a row to the Sqlite client and perform another sync.  The progress tracking received is:

# 1 - solves data loss issue 

The issue is, that the `WebServerOrchestrator` just creates a new `clientBatchInfo` if it is null.
The issue with this is: If you send changes in batches and the server session is lost (e.g. due to an ApplicationPool recycle or because the Redis cache was cleared), it will just forget all the batches that were already sent during the ongoing session!



See the following sequencediagram for clarification:
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Server
    loop GetLocalChanges
        Client->>Client: create 2 batch files (b0, b1, b2)
    end
    Client->>Server: Send b0
    Note right of Server: session is lost <br/>=> clientBatchInfo is null
    Client->>Server: Send b1
    Client->>Server: Send b2
    loop ApplyChanges
         Server->>Server: deserialize all batches and apply to database
         Note right of Server: Only inserts b1 and b2!<br/>b0 changes are forever lost!
    end

``` 

The only thing I had to add to fix this is a null-check:
```diff
            // ------------------------------------------------------------
            // FIRST STEP : receive client changes
            // ------------------------------------------------------------

+            // ensure that the blientBatchInfo is still available in the session - it **must** only be null when the batchIndex is 0!!
+            if (sessionCache.ClientBatchInfo == null && httpMessage.BatchIndex != 0)
+                throw new SyncException(""Session loss: No batchPartInfo could found for the current sessionId. It seems the session was lost. Please try again."");

            // We are receiving changes from client
            // BatchInfo containing all BatchPartInfo objects
            // Retrieve batchinfo instance if exists
            // Get batch info from session cache if exists, otherwise create it
            if (sessionCache.ClientBatchInfo == null)
                sessionCache.ClientBatchInfo = new BatchInfo(clientWorkInMemory, Schema, this.Options.BatchDirectory);

```


Interestingly, your code **does** check whether the session is empty when the client is **requesting** additional batches.
So I just added a test to cover the fact that this will also not break in the future.




# 2 `HttpMessageSendChangesRequestArgs` takes a `byte[]` - what for?
I had to implement ""OnReceiveChanges"" interception
Why is the parameter `HttpMessageSendChangesRequestArgs` of `OnSendChanges` taking the binary data as a parameter?

I would argue, that when I do intercept this call, I would like to see what changes are sent.
But in the current implementation, I only do get a byte array.
The only thing I could think of was to manipulate this array to e.g. add another layer of compression/encryption. Is that the intention?
As I did not see any real sense in that, I removed this.
Instead (and also in order to create an integration test for this scenario) I changed the constructor to take a `HttpMessageSendChangesRequest` as a parameter instead of the `byte[]`:
```
public class HttpMessageSendChangesRequestArgs : ProgressArgs
    {
        public HttpMessageSendChangesRequestArgs(HttpMessageSendChangesRequest request) 
		{
			...
		}
	}

```

Likewhise, I had to add `HttpMessageSendChangesRequest` to the `HttpMessageSendChangesRequestArgs`

Additionally, the Interception happens **before** the changes are serialized.
That way, the interceptor can actually *modify* the changes sent to the server!

# 3 - Added integration test to ensure deferred transaction are never used by SqliteSyncProvider
Additionally, I added a specific integration test that ensures that the SqliteSyncProvider does **not** use deferred transactions when selecting local changes as this can also lead to data loss in the future!

- Then I sync C to B. Still good, now Item 1 is in A, B and C.
- Now I create Item #2 in C. I sync, it indicates that changes have been uploaded. Checking in the B DB, I see the item is actually there.
- Now, I sync B to A, expecting #2 to move to A. It says 0 changes have been uploaded. Checking in A DB confirms the item is not in A.

I am working on a .NET client application that needs to sync data from a cloud server through a WEB API. We are currently doing this by using a modified date column in the SQL Server database but this is proving problematic! Your framework may just be the answer :-) I have been looking for a long time for something like this framework - it really is excellent but there is one thing I can't quite figure out from reading the docs and making some test applications.

Let's say my clients are all on version 0.1 and have a particular schema. All clients talk to my WEB API v0.1 and everything works great. I then have a new version of my WEB API, v0.2, with new tables and columns that I need to add to my sync. However, I don't want my clients running v0.1 to get these new tables and columns. I only want those new columns and tables to be synced with clients running a new v0.2 of the software, and I want to roll out my new v0.2 version slowly to all clients. So there will be a period of time where my v0.1 clients will be connecting to my v0.2 WEB API. Is this possible? Any time I've tried changing my server side like this it seems to breaks the client side. The only way that I can think to get it to work is to create a new application in IIS for each WEB API release so that they are completely separate URLs.

I implemented ISerializerFactory and ISerializer<T> interfaces for a MessagePack serialiser/deserialiser as follows:

```
﻿using System.IO;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Dotmim.Sync.Serialization;
using MessagePack;
using MessagePack.Resolvers;

 namespace Radio.Sync.API.Serializer
{
    public class CustomMessagePackSerializerFactory : ISerializerFactory
    {
        public string Key => ""mpack"";

        public ISerializer<T> GetSerializer<T>()
        {
            return new CustomMessagePackSerializer<T>();
        }
    }

    public class CustomMessagePackSerializer<T> : ISerializer<T>
    {
        private readonly MessagePackSerializerOptions _options;

        public CustomMessagePackSerializer()
        {
            _options = MessagePackSerializerOptions.Standard.WithResolver(ContractlessStandardResolver.Instance);
        }

        public async Task<T> DeserializeAsync(Stream ms)
        {
            var val = await MessagePackSerializer.DeserializeAsync<T>(ms, _options);
            return val;
        }

        public async Task<byte[]> SerializeAsync(T obj)
        {
            using (var ms = new MemoryStream())
            {
                await MessagePackSerializer.SerializeAsync(ms, obj, _options);
                return ms.ToArray();
            }
        }
    }
}
```

On the server side I added the factory to WebServerOptions
```
	var options = new WebServerOptions
	{
	    ServerCacheSlidingExpiration = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(webServerOptions.ServerCacheSlidingExpirationSecs),
	    ClientCacheSlidingExpiration = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(webServerOptions.ClientCacheSlidingExpirationSecs),
	};
	options.Serializers.Add(new CustomMessagePackSerializerFactory());
```

On the client side I added to the WebClientOrchestrator
```
	return new WebClientOrchestrator($""{_endPoint}/sync"")
	{
	    Setup = _syncSetup,
	    Options = _syncOptions,
	    HttpClient = {Timeout = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(60)},
	    SerializerFactory = new CustomMessagePackSerializerFactory()
	};
```

Could it be objects contained in HttpMessageEnsureSchemaResponse are not agreeing to be serialised? Maybe MessagePack requires special annotations `Key` etc rather than `DataContract` and `DataMember`?

How can I set up OR statement between two parameters in the WHERE statement of a setup filter?

`var myFilter = new SetupFilter(""BaseTable"");
myFilter AddParameter(""ParameterA"", ""BaseTable"");
myFilter.AddParameter(""ParameterB"", System.Data.DbType.String);
        myFilter.AddJoin(Join.Left, ""Table1"").On(""Table1"", ""Id"", ""BaseTable"", ""Table1Id"");

        setup.Filters.Add(myFilter);`

The above uses AND between the two parameters.

I have. also tried the following:

`var myFilter = new SetupFilter(""BaseTable"");

I've been following the documentation and I've been able to test the bidirectional sync using a server and a client on the same network. However, when I moved to try it out with my online server (Azure), I get the following error:
Dotmim.Sync.SyncException: Format of the initialization string does not conform to specification starting at index 0

Searching on Google, the problem seems to point to a connecting string issue. The connection to the database seems to be fine from accessing the api/sync endpoint.

Can someone help me format my azure connection string to work with Dotmim?

I've been using Dotmim.Sync 0.3.0 in my project for a while and decided to test the latest version 0.5.6. I'm having a problem with slow performance for tables with a GUID PK syncing from SQL Server to Sqlite over HTTP. I made a little chart to compare Dotmim.Sync 0.3.0 vs 0.5.6. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39327472/91123019-25883380-e6df-11ea-9faa-d361419838d8.png)

The chart shows the older version completes ~355K rows in about 4 mins. However the new version (0.5.6) takes 3 hrs 24 mins for the same data getting progressively slower for each batch. I'm using a GUID PK in some of the tables in my application to avoid a sync conflict on the server. Both data sets were collected with Microsoft.Data.Sqlite 3.1.3. 

If I do a heavy sync from a table with an int PK performance is good. Nothing to see there.

I create a complete sqlite db in one heavy sync and ship that inside a desktop installer. The app is used to rollout and maintain emergency radio equipment for firefighters in Victoria, Australia.

A complete sync normally takes around 10 minutes but the new version blows out to more than 6 hrs in total. The performance is just as bad if I use a snapshot because the bottle neck is inserting data into sqlite and not transfering the data across HTTP. 

Btw great to see 0.5.6 is now much faster across HTTP. 

Not sure if this is relevant but Microsoft.Data.Sqlite >= verison 3.0.0 now stores GUIDs as text and not binary. https://www.bricelam.net/2019/08/22/microsoft-data-sqlite-3-0.html

More than happy to retest performance if you make changes.

this is a fresh SQLite client database. I am testing the sync process.
I'm using a `SqlSyncChangeTrackingProvider` for the server side.
On the first sync, it throws this error.
My current workaround i:

```
           agent.LocalOrchestrator.OnOutdated(outdated =>
            {
               outdated.Action = OutdatedAction.Reinitialize;
            });
```

But I'm puzzled as why an updated client db is consider ""outdated"".

I know a lot of people are waiting this feature, for a while.
You can now **resolve a conflict from the client side**

It's not an ideal solution, but it's working...
The idea is to make basically **two** sync.
- The first one will sync and creates a conflict (resolved) on the server
- The second one will send back the conflict row resolved from the client perspective

You can find the tests here : 
https://github.com/Mimetis/Dotmim.Sync/blob/cb088d601b24eb0b2ef5d10c04fed6488ae4f4a7/Tests/Dotmim.Sync.Tests/TcpConflictsTests.cs#L1681

Basically, here is an extract of the code:

``` csharp
var agent = new SyncAgent(client.Provider, Server.Provider, options, new SyncSetup(Tables));

var localOrchestrator = agent.LocalOrchestrator;
var remoteOrchestrator = agent.RemoteOrchestrator;

// Conflict resolution SHOULD BE set to ServerWins
options.ConflictResolutionPolicy = ConflictResolutionPolicy.ServerWins;

// From client : Remote is server, Local is client
// From here, we are going to let the client decides who is the winner of the conflict
localOrchestrator.OnApplyChangesFailed(acf =>
{
    // Check conflict is correctly set
    var localRow = acf.Conflict.LocalRow;
    var remoteRow = acf.Conflict.RemoteRow;

    // From that point, you can easily letting the client decides who is the winner
    // You can do a merge or whatever
    // Show a UI with the local / remote row and letting him decides what is the good row version
    // for testing purpose; will just going to set name to some fancy UI_CLIENT... instead of CLI or SRV

    // SHOW UI
    // OH.... CLIENT DECIDED TO SET NAME TO ""BLA BLA BLA"" 

    // BE AS FAST AS POSSIBLE IN YOUR DESICION, SINCE WE HAVE AN OPENED CONNECTION / TRANSACTION RUNNING
  
    remoteRow[""Name""] = clientNameDecidedOnClientMachine;

    // Mandatory to override the winner registered in the tracking table
    // Use with caution !
    // To be sure the row will be marked as updated locally, the scope id should be set to null
    acf.SenderScopeId = null;
});

// From Server : Remote is client, Local is server
// From that point we do not do anything, letting the server to resolve the conflict and send back
// the server row and client row conflicting to the client
remoteOrchestrator.OnApplyChangesFailed(acf =>
{
    // Check conflict is correctly set
    var localRow = acf.Conflict.LocalRow;
    var remoteRow = acf.Conflict.RemoteRow;

    // remote is client; local is server
    Assert.StartsWith(""CLI"", remoteRow[""Name""].ToString());
    Assert.StartsWith(""SRV"", localRow[""Name""].ToString());

    Assert.Equal(ConflictResolution.ServerWins, acf.Resolution);
    Assert.Equal(ConflictType.RemoteExistsLocalExists, acf.Conflict.Type);

});

// First sync, we allow server to resolve the conflict and send back the result to client
var s = await agent.SynchronizeAsync();

Assert.Equal(1, s.TotalChangesDownloaded);
Assert.Equal(1, s.TotalChangesUploaded);
Assert.Equal(1, s.TotalResolvedConflicts);

// From this point the Server row Name is STILL ""SRV....""
// And the Client row NAME is ""BLA BLA BLA...""
// Make a new sync to send ""BLA BLA BLA..."" to Server

s = await agent.SynchronizeAsync();

Assert.Equal(0, s.TotalChangesDownloaded);
Assert.Equal(1, s.TotalChangesUploaded);
Assert.Equal(0, s.TotalResolvedConflicts);

We need help to understand if the behavior is correct or if there is a bug.

We have a client that works offline and that periodically synchronize with a server (with the purge of the metadata on client side (CleanMetadatas=true)). The user can use both to read and update entities.
The client uses SQLite for persistence and the server uses SQL Server. Both use EF Core for the data access layer and we prepare the DB using the EF migrations.

The tested scenarios are:

1. **we delete a record X on the client side, we change the same record on the server side** and then we execute the synchronization from the client: 
> we expected a RemoteExistsLocalIsDelete conflict, but we receive RemotedIsDeletedLocalIsDeleted and 
> - if we choice, on the server side, in the OnApplyChangesFailed code, the ServerWins conflict resolution, the synchronization completes successfully.
> - if we choice the ClientWins, the synchronization completes without errors but without changes applied: the server has the record but the client not.


2. **we delete a record X on the server side, we change the same record on the client side** and then we execute the synchronization from the client:
> we expected RemoteIsDeletedLocalExists conflict but we receive RemoteExistsLocalExists and
> - if we choice the ServerWins, the synchronization completes without errors but without changes applied: the client has the record but the server not.

3. **what’s meaning of RemoteIsDeletedLocalIsDeleted conflict?** Why does it throw this conflict if client and server deletes the same record?

4. **we add a new record on the server side, update it on the server side** and then we execute the synchronization from the client:
> - if we choice, on server side, in the OnApplyChangesFailed code, the ServerWins or ClientWins conflict resolution, the synchronization completes successfully.
> - if we choice the ConflictResolution.Rollback, the synchronization fails. Why is there a conflict? what's the meaning of RemoteExistsLocalNotExists?
   
5. **we add a new record on the server side, delete it on the server side** and then we execute the synchronization from the client:
> - if we choice the ConflictResolution.Rollback the synchronization fails but we don't receive the conflict, the RemoteIsDeletedLocalNotExists conflict. What's the meaning of RemoteIsDeletedLocalNotExists?
   
6. **is there a way to manage the synchronization of a record with relationships (with foreign key)?**
> we add a child record, on the client side, to an existing parent record, delete the parent record on the server side then we execute the synchronization on the client:
> - regardless we choice the ClientWins or ServerWins, the synchronization completes without errors, the parent record is deleted but the child not. So, we have an orphan child record!

7. **we delete a record X on the client side, after we update the same record on the server side and add a child record Y. Why in this case the conflict type is RemoteIsDeletedLocalIsDeleted?** 
> - if we choice the ClientWins, the records X and Y are not deleted.

8. **we update a record X on the client side and add a child Y, after we delete, on the server side, the record X**. Then we execute the synchronization from the client:
> - if we choice ServerWins or ClientWins, the record X is deleted from both sides, instead the record Y is persisted on client and server like an orphan child. There was no conflict generated.

9. **we add, on the client side, a child record Y to an existing record X, after we add, on the server side, a record Z to the record X, in the end we delete the entity X and Z on server.** Then we execute the synchronization from the client:
> - if we choice ServerWins or ClientWins, there is a resolved conflict, but the event OnApplyChangesFailed is never triggered. For this reason, the conflict type is unknown. Like result the orphan record Y was not cancelled and was persisted even on server. 

10. **we add, on the client side, a child record Y, after we delete the entity X on the client side, on server we add a child record Z to X. Why in this case the conflict type is 
 RemoteIsDeletedLocalIsDeleted?**
> - if we choice the ClientWins, no changes was applied on the client and the server side and after synchronization. 


To give to user a greater control on syncronization we need **some other features**:
- we need to **set the conflict resolution policy on the client sinde** at each synchronization.
> in details, we would 
> - start, from the client, a first synchronization with a rollback conflict resolution;
> - leave to user the choice of the resolution strategy to use;
> - start, from the client, a second synchronization with a conflict resolution choosed from the user;
> do we have to send a SyncParamenter from client to server and use it on OnApplyChangesFailed on server?

5.	I only want to update single column in single table that is “Tag_Colors”.  
6. When to call provision/deprovision related code? Suppose once I provision/deprovision, Should I remove code or it will get executed with every sync?

I am trying to minimize the sync overhead in my mobile app (xamarin) with uploading only to the server of the modified client record instead of a full sync every time.
So, the scenario is that the user modifies data in an entry on the phone and when the entry_unfocused runs I call a sync where I want to upload the changed record to the server without downloading anything.
Server: Mysql.
Client:SQLite.
What happens is that the modified record does not get uploaded and the next full sync the client database loses all of the records! The sync empties the table :(

Please help.

Thanks

Here's the full sync: (Runs fine if the upload-only routine is never called)
```c#

   public static async Task Sync()   
        {
            MySqlSyncProvider serverProvider = new MySqlSyncProvider(serverConnectionString);

            SqliteSyncProvider clientProvider = new SqliteSyncProvider(databasePathAndName);
            var progress = new SynchronousProgress<ProgressArgs>(args => Console.WriteLine($""{args.Context.SyncStage}:{args.Message}""));
            var tables = new string[] { myTablename };
            var syncSetup = new SyncSetup(tables);
            syncSetup.Tables[myTablename].SyncDirection = Dotmim.Sync.Enumerations.SyncDirection.Bidirectional;
            SyncAgent agent = new SyncAgent(clientProvider, serverProvider, new SyncOptions(), tables);
            var result =  await agent.SynchronizeAsync(progress);
            Console.WriteLine(result);
        }


And the upload-only procedure:

 public static async Task SyncUploadOnly()   
        {
          
            var tables = new string[] { myTablename };
            var syncSetup = new SyncSetup(tables);
            syncSetup.Tables[myTablename].SyncDirection = Dotmim.Sync.Enumerations.SyncDirection.UploadOnly;
            MySqlSyncProvider serverProvider = new MySqlSyncProvider(serverConnectionString);
            SqliteSyncProvider clientProvider = new SqliteSyncProvider(databasePathAndName);
            var progress = new SynchronousProgress<ProgressArgs>(args => Console.WriteLine($""{args.Context.SyncStage}:{args.Message}""));
            SyncAgent agent = new SyncAgent(clientProvider, serverProvider,new SyncOptions(), syncSetup);
            var result = await agent.SynchronizeAsync(progress);
            Console.WriteLine(result);

When I am using .AddCustomWhere() it is adding string at the end of stored procedure like 

Select * from TableName where id=@id and [String in .AddCustomWhere()). 

What I am trying to achieve is using OR instead of AND 

Say I have table name AbpUsers which have TenantId [NULL Bool Column], I would like to have query like this : 
`Select * from AbpUsers where TenantId=@TenantIdOR TenantId IS NULL`

I have used filters like this:

``` cs
//----- Filters 
SetupFilter userFilter = new SetupFilter(""AbpUsers"");
userFilter.AddParameter(""TenantId"", DbType.Int64,false);
userFilter.AddWhere(""TenantId"", ""AbpUsers"", ""TenantId"");
userFilter.AddCustomerWhere(""TenantId IS NULL"");
setup.Filters.Add(userFilter);`
```
This  is creating stored procedure like: 

``` cs
WHERE
 (
   ([base].[TenantId] = @TenantId)
  )

AND
(
  TenantId IS NULL
)
```

But I need OR instead of AND in last condition.

One More thing: Who to update stored procedures if I add/remove filters? Do they automatically updated or there is any other process?

Please help!

DMS does not sync if client database was created before fist sync attempt.

All scenarios involves MySql server and SQLite client and run on Xamarin.iOS.

**Scenario 1**: Server table exists and has a record - but not supporting tables - , client database does not exist. After sync, client DB gets created - with all additional tables on both server and client - and after records added to the client, subsequent syncs work just fine.

**Scenario 1.a**: Server table exists -without supporting tables - but is empty, client database does not exist. After first sync all supporting tables get created on both server and client side. After adding a record to the client and attempting to sync again it throws a ""Dotmim.Sync.SyncException: Input string was not in a correct format"" error.

**Scenario 2**: Both client and server tables exist, with same structure - without supporting tables - , server table is empty, client has records. Sync creates supporting tables, stored procedures etc. both on the server and client but does not upload any record from client to server. No error thrown.

**Scenario 2.a**: Both client and server tables exist, with same structure - without supporting tables - , (client table got created before 1st sync attempt) both tables are empty. First sync with empty tables is successful! After writing a record to the client and attempting to sync an error is thrown by var result = await agent.SynchronizeAsync(progress);

**Dotmim.Sync.SyncException: Input string was not in a correct format.**

Steps to reproduce the error:
- Create a table with at least a row on the server.

- Once the table and row is created on the client, edit a row.

Running the SyncAgent again will throw an exception.

I really appreciate the work you're putting in to this solution.
However, I have run into a problem I can't solve on my own. I am experimenting the basic sync and all is good until I try to implement it in a Xamarin.iOS solution. (It works like a charm in console app.)

Environment: Xamarin, MySql and SQLite and the error is Dotmim.Sync.SyncException: Index was outside the bounds of the array. 

The local SQLite database gets created, and the scope_info table in it as well, but it fails on MySql, no matter if the table exists or not on the server (schema does exist).

Could you please help me out with this? I can't add the sync functionality to my app as long as this issue exists.

we have an exisiting application with different table names on client and server with the same column definitions. We can't rename tables on either side easily. 

My Idea was to use sql server synonyms (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/statements/create-synonym-transact-sql) to have equal table names.

Synonyms are supported by the t-sql CHANGETABLE command (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/system-functions/changetable-transact-sql):
""The table name can be a synonym to the table""

Unfortunately Dotmim throws an ""table does not exist"" error at agent.SynhronizeAsync().

Is there a possibilty for us to solve our problem without renaming the tables?

I tried searching the docs, but didn't find what I was looking for.

I have an application that has a MS SQL as a remote server and SQLite as the local database. There are occasions where the client application will not have network connectivity and will need to create records on the local table and sync the data at a later time. There is also the very likely possibility that multiple client applications will be creating records to the table during this time span. The table in question has a simple ID column that is set as the primary key and auto increments.

My question is specifically handle the following scenario:

Client A and Client B sync Table 1 at the same time so they both have an identical copy of the remote data stored into an SQLite local DB. Table 1 has the last record ID of 505. Client A uses the application without an internet connection and adds a new record to Table 1. In sqlite, it is assigned the row ID of 506. Client B has a stable internet connection and inserts a new row into Table 1 and is assigned the row ID of 506 and sync's without issue.  Some time later, Client A gets back to a stable internet connection and sync's the data. 

In my test of this scenario, dotmim.sync will try to add the record to the remote Db, notices that there is a record with row ID 506 already existing and will resolve the conflict with the server winning and client A's data being discarded. 

What I am hoping to accomplish is for dotmim.sync to somehow realize (or for me to somehow notate) that Client A's 506 record was newly created created locally and that it is a different record than the remote DB's 506 (originating from Client B) so it should insert Client A's record into the remote DB with a new ID (ie 507) and then update Client A's local database to match the remote DB.

Is there someway to accomplish this in Dotmim.sync (or some way I could accomplish this by handling the Primary Key differently)?",NA,FALSE,https://api.github.com/repos/Mimetis/Dotmim.Sync,https://api.github.com/repos/Mimetis/Dotmim.Sync/issues/267/labels{/name},https://api.github.com/repos/Mimetis/Dotmim.Sync/issues/267/comments,https://api.github.com/repos/Mimetis/Dotmim.Sync/issues/267/events,https://github.com/Mimetis/Dotmim.Sync/issues/267,NA

     I tried to sync a SQL SERVER database model that holds a table with a XML column using the trigger model. I recieved this error:  _The XML data type cannot be compared or sorted, except when using the IS NULL operator_. I configured the framework to exclude the xml column and it works ok.
    I isolated the bug to the update trigger creation. It seems that IFNULL term doesn't work with XML columns. Have you considered using  COALESCE expression instead? I attached the table script that reproduces the error and a code template for the trigger for your consideration.  Thanks in advance!

I've finally reach a point, where I've almost done all the features I wanted to develop for this framework.

I still have some more things to add, like:
- An **advanced filter management**, where changing a value from a filter, should remove the lines from any client that is not any more part of the filter.
I tried several solutions to get a universal solution that will work in almost all cases, but it's really, really really hard .... So far, I've no idea if I will be able to implement such system...
- A **logging system**.  This is something that is missing, definitively, and it's not really complicated to integrate. I'm not yet decided on what kind of system I should go, and if you have any idea, I would love to hear from you

Other than that, I'm pretty happy with the actual features in place in the last version.

This PR is all about Setup migration

It's quite complicated, once you have created your sync configuration, and once it's running, to add or remove tables to a named scope...

For example going from this:
``` cs
var setup = new SyncSetup(new string[] { ""ProductCategory"", ""Product"" })
```

to this:
``` cs
var setup = new SyncSetup(new string[] { ""ProductCategory"", ""Product"", ""ProductDescription"" })
```
Is really complicated...

With this PR, **DMS** will automaticaly migrate your whole **old** Setup configuration to match your **new** Setup.

Basically, **DMS** will make a comparison between the **last valid** Setup:
- Stored in the `scope_info` table on the local database 
- Stored in the `scope_info_server` for the server side database

And then will merge the databases, adding *tracking tables*, *stored procedures*, *triggers* and *tables* if needed

## Example 1

Going from this:
``` cs
var setup = new SyncSetup(new string[] { ""ProductCategory"", ""Product"" })
```
to this:
``` cs
var setup = new SyncSetup(new string[] { ""ProductCategory"", ""Product"", ""ProductDescription"" })
```
Will generate:
- A new table `ProductDescription` on the client
- A new tracking table `ProductDescription_tracking` on the client and the server
- New **stored procedures** on both databases
- New **triggers** on both databases

## Example 2

Going from this:
``` cs
var setup = new SyncSetup(new string[] { ""ProductCategory"", ""Product"" })
```
to this:
``` cs
var setup = new SyncSetup(new string[] { ""ProductCategory"", ""Product"" })
{
    TrackingTablesPrefix = ""t"",
    TrackingTablesSuffix = """",
};
```
Will generate:
- A renaming of the trackings tables on both databases
AND because renaming the trackings tables will have an impact on triggers and stored proc ..
- A drop / create of all stored procedures
- A drop / create of all triggers

## LocalOrchestrator and RemoteOrchestrator methods

First of all, if you are just using `agent.SynchronizeAsync()`, everything will be handled automatically.  

But you can use the orchestrators to do the job. It will allow you to migrate your setup, without having to make a synchronization.

You have 2 new methods on both orchestrators:

On `LocalOrchestrator`:

``` cs
public virtual async Task MigrationAsync(SyncSetup oldSetup, SyncSet schema, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default, IProgress<ProgressArgs> progress = null)
```
Basically, you need the old setup to migrate `oldSetup`, and the new `schema`. 
You don't need the new `Setup` because you have already add it during the **ctor** of the `LocalOrchestrator`

Why do you need the `schema` ? If you are adding a new table, that is not present locally, we need the schema from the server side, to get the new table structure.

Here is an example, using this method on your local database:

``` cs
// adding 2 new tables
var newSetup = new SyncSetup(new string[] { ""ProductCategory"", ""Product"", ""ProdutModel"", ""ProductDescription"" });

// local orchestrator
var localOrchestrator = new LocalOrchestrator(clientProvider, options, setup);

// remote orchestrator to get the schema for the 2 new tables to add
var remoteOrchestrator = new RemoteOrchestrator(serverProvider, options, setup);
// If you are on a web sync architecture, you can use the WebClientOrchestrator as well:
// var remoteOrchestrator = new WebClientOrchestrator(serviceUri)

// get the old setup
var scopeInfo = await localOrchestrator.GetClientScopeAsync();
var oldSetup = scopeInfo.Setup;

// get the schema
var schema = await remoteOrchestrator.GetSchemaAsync();

// Migrating the old setup to the new one, using the schema if needed
await localOrchestrator.MigrationAsync(oldSetup, schema);
```
On `RemoteOrchestrator`:

``` cs
public virtual async Task MigrationAsync(SyncSetup oldSetup, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default, IProgress<ProgressArgs> progress = null)
```
Basically, it's the same method as on `LocalOrchestrator` but we don't need to pass a schema, since we are on the server side, and we know how to get the schema :)

The same example will become:

``` cs
// adding 2 new tables
var newSetup = new SyncSetup(new string[] { ""ProductCategory"", ""Product"", ""ProdutModel"", ""ProductDescription"" });

// remote orchestrator to get the schema for the 2 new tables to add
var remoteOrchestrator = new RemoteOrchestrator(serverProvider, options, setup);

// get the old setup
var serverScopeInfo = await remoteOrchestrator.GetServerScopeAsync();
var oldServerSetup = serverScopeInfo.Setup;

// Migrating the old setup to the new one, using the schema if needed
await remoteOrchestrator.MigrationAsync(oldServerSetup);
```

For instance, the `RemoteOrchestrator` `MigrationAsync` could be really useful if you want to migrate your server database, when configuring as **HTTP** mode.

Once migrated, all new clients, will get the new setup from the server, and will apply locally the migration, automatically.

## What Setup migration doesn't do !

Be careful, the migration stuff will **only** allows you to migrate your setup (adding or removing tables from your sync, renaming stored proc and so on ...)

**You can't use it to migrate your own schema database !!**

Well, it could work if:
- You are adding a new table : Quite easy, just add this table to your `SyncSetup` and you're done.
- You are removing a table: Once again, easy, remove it from your `SyncSetup`, and you're good to go
- You are removing physically a column from a table on your server: You **can't** use this technic to migrate your clients database.

The **DMS** framework won't be able to make an `Alter table` to add / remove columns. Too complicated to handle, too much possibilities and scenario.

If you have to deal with this kind of situation, the best solution is to
- Call `DeprovisionAsync`
- Apply your alter 
- Call `ProvisionAsync`
It's a manual step, not automatically handled by the **DMS** framework, but it's working

## Last timestamp sync

Oh wait, last thing....
Let's talk about our first example, where we have added a new table `ProductDescription`.   

What's happen on the next sync ?  
Well as we said the table `ProductDescription` will be provisioned (stored proc, triggers and tracking table) on both databases (server / client) and if the table does not exists on the client, it will be created.   

Then the **DMS** framework will make a sync ....

And this sync will get all the rows from the server side **that have changed since the last sucessful sync**

And you look the `ProductDescription` table on the client database : **NO ROWS** !!!

As you understand, you will have an empty `ProductDescription` table on the client !! : Because no rows have been marked as **changed** in the server tracking table.
Indeed, we've just created this tracking table on the server !!

So, if you're adding a new table, you **MUST** do a full sync, call the `SynchronizeAsync()` method with a `SyncType.Reinitialize` or  `SyncType.ReinitializeWithUpload` parameter.

Adding a new table is not trivial.   
Hopefully if you are using `snapshots` it should not be too heavy for your server database :) 

## Pro Tip: Forcing Reinitialize sync type from server side.

As we saw, it could be useful to force a reinitialize from a client, to get all the needed data.   
Unfortunatelly, you should have a *special* routine from the client side, to launch the synchronization with a `SynchronizeAsync(SyntType.Reinitialize)`, like an admin button or whatever.   

Fortunatelly, using an interceptor, from the **server side**, you are able to *force* the reinitialization from the client.

On the server side, from your controller, just modify the request `SyncContext` with the correct value, like this:

``` cs
[HttpPost]
public async Task Post()
{

    // Get Orchestrator regarding the incoming scope name (from http context)
    var orchestrator = webServerManager.GetOrchestrator(this.HttpContext);

    // override sync type to force a reinitialization from a particular client
    orchestrator.OnServerScopeLoaded(sla =>
    {
        // ClientId represents one client. If you want to reinitialize ALL clients, just remove this condition
        if (sla.Context.ClientScopeId == clientId)
        {
            sla.Context.SyncType = SyncType.Reinitialize;
        }
    });

    // handle request
    await webServerManager.HandleRequestAsync(this.HttpContext);
}

```

Better interceptors to get rows after rows have been selecting
Better interceptor to get rows before rows are applied

```cs
// Intercept a table changes selecting
// Because the changes are not yet selected, we can easily interrupt the process with the cancellation token
agent.LocalOrchestrator.OnTableChangesSelecting(args =>
{
    Console.WriteLine($""-------- Getting changes from table {args.Table.GetFullName()} ..."");

    if (args.Table.TableName == ""Table_That_Should_Not_Be_Sync"")
        cts.Cancel();
});

// Intercept a table changes applying with a particular state [Upsert] or [Deleted]
// The rows included in the args.Changes table will be applied right after.
agent.LocalOrchestrator.OnTableChangesApplying(args =>
{
    Console.WriteLine($""-------- Applying changes {args.State} to table {args.Changes.GetFullName()} ..."");

    if (args.Changes == null || args.Changes.Rows.Count == 0)
        return;

    foreach (var row in args.Changes.Rows)
        Console.WriteLine(row);
});

// Intercept a table changes selected.
// The rows included in the args.Changes have been selected from the datasource and will be sent to the server
agent.LocalOrchestrator.OnTableChangesSelected(args =>
{
    if (args.Changes == null || args.Changes.Rows.Count == 0)
        return;

    foreach (var row in args.Changes.Rows)
        Console.WriteLine(row);
});
```


## Metadata

Metadata cleanup is fully implemented

```cs
// Call a server delete metadata to update the last valid timestamp value in scope_info_server table
var dmc = await agent.RemoteOrchestrator.DeleteMetadatasAsync();

```

## IsOutdated

Now the client is able to verify if the local database is out dated

```cs
agent.LocalOrchestrator.OnOutdated(oa =>
{
    Console.ForegroundColor = ConsoleColor.Red;
    Console.WriteLine(""local database is too old to synchronize with the server."");
    Console.ResetColor();
    Console.WriteLine(""Do you want to synchronize anyway, and potentially lost data ? "");
    Console.Write(""Enter a value ('r' for reinitialize or 'ru' for reinitialize with upload): "");
    var answer = Console.ReadLine();

    if (answer.ToLowerInvariant() == ""r"")
        oa.Action = OutdatedAction.Reinitialize;
    else if (answer.ToLowerInvariant() == ""ru"")
        oa.Action = OutdatedAction.ReinitializeWithUpload;

});
```

## LocalOrchestrator and RemoteOrchestrator

Now the orchestrators have more flexible methods.


### Getting changes, before making a synchronization

```cs
var clientProvider = new SqlSyncProvider(clientConnectionString);
// Create a local orchestrator, to manage the local database
var localOrchestrator = new LocalOrchestrator(clientProvider, Config.GetClientOptions(), Config.GetSetup());

// Get changes to be populated to the server
var changes = await localOrchestrator.GetChangesAsync(progress: Config.GetProgress());

// enumerate changes retrieved
foreach (var tableChanges in changes.ClientChangesSelected.TableChangesSelected)
{
    foreach (var table in changes.ClientBatchInfo.GetTable(tableChanges.TableName, tableChanges.SchemaName))
    {
        Console.ForegroundColor = ConsoleColor.White;
        Console.WriteLine($""Changes for table {table.GetFullName()}"");
        Console.ResetColor();
        foreach (var row in table.Rows)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(row);
        }
    }
}
```


## Mutli scope

Now multi scopes are correctly handled by the web server side

## Web : Web page to get the summary of your sync

A default web page is created if [GET] is provided

## Providers async

All methods from all providers are now `async`

## Docs

docs updated
new samples

## Provision and Deprovision

Now Provision and Deprovision are part of the DMS core API.

``` cs
var serverProvider = new SqlSyncProvider(serverConnectionString);
var clientProvider = new SqlSyncProvider(clientConnectionString);

The main reason was another new feature: In `v0.4` only the client is responsible of the starting point of its own sync session.
Eventually server does not care of any *client start point in time*.
That's why we did not need the `scope_info` table on the server side for handling start and end of sync.
It means a lot of simplicity for handling clients. Because the server is *agnostic* to any clients.

But...

We miss so much information on the server side, that why I've decided to bring the `scope_info` back in the server database.

Even more, the `v0.5` will bring **2** new tables:
- `scope_info_server` : This table will contains the schema declared in your code.
- `scope_info_history`: This table will contains the last sync session from any client, for info.

### scope_info_server

As I said, this table contains some useful informations:
- *sync_scope_name*: Identifier. Each scope name represents a schema
- *sync_scope_schema*: Actual schema

Since we have the schema declared by code, why having schema in database ? 
Well one main reason for that is to be able to recreate portion of the `Dotmim.Sync` sql components when you are making some changes in your coded schema...
Supposing you're adding (or removing) a table from your `SyncSetup`, in your code:

```
// Actually we are using these tables
// var setup = new SyncSetup(new string[] { ""Address"", ""Customer"", ""CustomerAddress"", ""SalesOrderHeader"", ""SalesOrderDetail"" });

// Now I need also Product !
var setup = new SyncSetup(new string[] { ""Product"", ""Address"", ""Customer"", ""CustomerAddress"", ""SalesOrderHeader"", ""SalesOrderDetail"" });
```
Today, you have to manually `DeprovisionAsync()` and `ProvisionAsync()` again your whole database.
It could be really complicated...

The idea is to be able to compare your coded schema with the last schema stored in the database.
Then make all mandatories operations in the databse to be sure everything will run smoothly.

- *sync_scope_last_clean_timestamp*: Last time the metadatas for all tables involved in this schema have been deleted.

Now that we can delete metadatas in the tracking tables, we need to be sure that any client who will try to sync its database has its *last time successful* sync time greater than *last cleanup metadatas*


### scope_info_history

This scope table will contains one line per client. Each line will have the last time the client tried to sync.
This table is pretty much the same as the actual `scope_info` table stored on the client:

- *sync_scope_name* : Scope name.
- *scope_last_sync_timestamp*: last **server** timestamp.
- *scope_last_sync_duration*: last **server** duration (Basically how much time to apply client batches and get back server changes)
- *scope_last_sync*: last **server** sync datetime.

FYI, The `scope_info` table from contains the same columns, plus one **client** column representing the client timestamp.

## Your thoughts ?

I'm actually working on this feature. 
But I'm pretty sure I miss some useful information that can be stored in these 2 tables.
What kind of info do you think we should save in these new tables ?

E.g. when a row is deleted, the metadata row in the _tracking table is still being kept.

This is to ensure, that clients that synchronize sometime in the future still get that deletion delivered to them.

However, at some point this metadata has to be removed from the system - otherwise the sql query time could degrade or the database could run full.

Possible solution: A configurable retention period per scope.

- in the server-side configuration a retention period can be specified (default: 4 weeks?)
- all _tracking tables of toombstoned records are only kept for 4 weeks and deleted thereafter
- each client sends the last time it synchronized a particular scope to the server
- if the server sees, that the client has last synced +4 weeks ago, it will return an error message, that the client needs to reinitialize
- the client then reinitializes the scope

Do you think this could be in the scope for Dotmim.Sync?
Basically one could implement this separately, but it feels like this could be a natural feature of Dotmim.Sync.

We recently had an issue in our system, that a blob value of one of our synced rows (we use a blob column for some stuff) was ""corrupted"".

One of the reasons for this could be that there was a small glitch during the transmittion of batch files that caused some bits in that blob to be swapped - resulting in that error.
When sending data over unstable networks, you face those issues from time to time.

What would be great is if 
- Dotmim.Sync actually calculated the hash of the batch file it tries to transmit 
- and adds that hash as a header to the request/response
- the receiving end then re-calculates the hash
- and if it does not match the header, it discards the data and errors.

Hashing big data sets is not that performance intensive as you might think.
We have a simple .netstandard2 compatible Hasher that can output a hash from a stream as Base64 string (suitable for HTTP headers ;-))

What do you think?
I think it would be a great addition to 0.4!

Looking at the code there is nothing available to set this option on. In our queries we are expecting only one record to be modified (Updated/Deleted)  and the lack of this functionality is giving us an error. I know in other database types this is not available but in SQL Server this could be problematic. In our case just placing  SET NOTCOUNT ON at  the beginning of the triggers solved the problem. Do you have a solution for this issue?

I'm creating a new feature called **Snapshot** 

The idea is to reduce the time for initialization of new clients.
Today, we have some troubles due to heavy work from the server side, when initializing a new client:
- Server has to prepare a big batch based on all tables involved in the sync (using `_Initialize` stored procedure)
  - It a heavy work for the server, and it's always the same work, for all clients (excepting filters cases)
- During this generation time, the client has to wait, with no response from server
  - This waiting time can potentially induces a `Timeout` on the client side, if you are in a `Http` mode. You can increase the [timeout duration](https://mimetis.github.io/Dotmim.Sync/Timeout), but it's not ideal

The idea of this PR is to:

## Server side

- Create a new method, that will generate a *snapshot* at a current time *T* with all rows / tables, available for all new clients:

``` cs
var serverProvider = new SqlSyncProvider(""Data Source= ..."");

// new setup with all tables involved
var setup = new SyncSetup(allTables);

// Directory used to store snapshots
var directory = Path.Combine(Environment.GetFolderPath(Environment.SpecialFolder.UserProfile), ""Snapshots"");

// Create the orchestrator based on the remote provider
var remoteOrchestrator = new RemoteOrchestrator(serverProvider);

// Create a snapshot
await remoteOrchestrator.CreateSnapshot(new SyncContext(), setup, directory, 500, CancellationToken.None);

```
Once created, the folder looks like this:

- `*.batch` files contains all the rows, for all tables
- `summary.json` contains all the mandatory information regarding this snapshot

We have here, the server `timestamp` when the snapshot was generated, all the files, ordered, with table contained in each file.

My idea is to generate all snapshots (global snapshot called `ALL` and filtered snapshots) every 10 or 20 days, depending on the new clients coming in the sync.

To activate this snapshot, the server should be able to get each snapshot when requested by a new client.

The `SyncOptions` (when on `TCP` mode) or `WebServerOptions` (when on `HTTP` mode) has a new property called `SnapshotsDirectory`:
``` cs
// Options used for client and server when used in a direct TCP mode:
var options = new SyncOptions { SnapshotsDirectory = Path.Combine(Environment.GetFolderPath(Environment.SpecialFolder.UserProfile), ""Snapshots"") };

// Options used for server side when using ASP.NET Core Web API. Will override everything coming from SyncOptions
var options = new WebServerOptions() { SnapshotsDirectory = Path.Combine(Environment.GetFolderPath(Environment.SpecialFolder.UserProfile), ""Snapshots"") };
```



The `ASP.NET Core` web api looks like this, now:

``` cs
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddMvc().SetCompatibilityVersion(CompatibilityVersion.Version_2_2);

    // Mandatory to be able to handle multiple sessions
    services.AddMemoryCache();
           
    // Get a connection string for your server data source
    var connectionString = Configuration.GetSection(""ConnectionStrings"")[""DefaultConnection""];

    // Set the web server Options
    var options = new WebServerOptions()
    {
        BatchDirectory = Path.Combine(SyncOptions.GetDefaultUserBatchDiretory(), ""server""),
        SnapshotsDirectory = Path.Combine(Environment.GetFolderPath(Environment.SpecialFolder.UserProfile), ""Snapshots"")
    };
        

    // Create the setup used for your sync process
    var tables = new string[] {""ProductCategory"",
                    ""ProductDescription"", ""ProductModel"",
                    ""Product"", ""ProductModelProductDescription"",
                    ""Address"", ""Customer"", ""CustomerAddress"",
                    ""SalesOrderHeader"", ""SalesOrderDetail"" };

    var setup = new SyncSetup(tables);

    // add a SqlSyncProvider acting as the server hub
    services.AddSyncServer<SqlSyncProvider>(connectionString, setup, options);
}
```


## Client side

On the client side, you don't have anything to do, just a normal new sync processus:

``` cs
var s = await agent.SynchronizeAsync(progress);
```
Here is an output of new client coming with a new client database :

As you can see, we have basically **2** Sync in a row.

- First one get the **schema**, and apply all the **batches** from the snapshot
- Second one get all the rows added / deleted / modified from the snapshot `TimeStamp` `T-1` and the last server `TimeStamp` `T` (in our sample just one `ProductCategory`)

Your thought ?

It includes a lot of new features and improvements.

This version **IS NOT** compatible with the actual version (`0.3`)

> **Update**: The `v0.4` packages are available as *pre-release* on nuget : https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=dotmim.sync

Here are some new features implemented:

## Change Tracking

New **Sql** provider that uses the **Change Tracking** feature, from SQL Server.
This provider is called `SqlSyncChangeTrackingProvider`.

`SqlSyncChangeTrackingProvider` is compatible with all others sync providers.

What does it mean ?
- No more tracking tables in your database
- No more triggers on your tables in your database
- Metadatas retention managed by SQL Server itself 
- Some restrictions on filters (especially on Delete statement with a filter)

To be able to use `SqlSyncChangeTrackingProvider` on your database, do not forget to active the **Change Tracking** on your database :

``` SQL
ALTER DATABASE AdventureWorks  
SET CHANGE_TRACKING = ON  
(CHANGE_RETENTION = 14 DAYS, AUTO_CLEANUP = ON)  
```

You don't have to activate **Change Tracking** on each table. It will be enabled by the `Dotmim.Sync` framework.


## Tracking tables

If you're not using the `SqlSyncChangeTrackingProvider` provider, your database will contain some tracking tables.

Un-necessary columns are removed from `_tracking` tables
- `create_scope_id` : Removed
- `create_timestamp` : Removed
- `update_timestamp` : Removed
- `update_scope_id` : Maintained : We need to know *who* is uploading data to a datastore, because the datastore should not select these data when he makes the `SelectChanges` method

Using a table `Address` as example, the `_tracking` table structure is now:

``` SQL
CREATE TABLE [dbo].[Address_tracking](
	[AddressID] [int] NOT NULL,
	[update_scope_id] [uniqueidentifier] NULL,
	[timestamp] [timestamp] NULL,
	[timestamp_bigint]  AS (CONVERT([bigint],[timestamp])) PERSISTED,
	[sync_row_is_tombstone] [bit] NOT NULL,
	[last_change_datetime] [datetime] NULL,
```
> `timestamp_bigint` is a compute column, only created on **SQL Server** to allow a better index on the `_tracking` table.

A new index is creating as well on `_tracking` table:

```
CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX [Address_tracking_timestamp_index] ON Address_tracking
([timestamp_bigint] ASC
,[update_scope_id] ASC
,[sync_row_is_tombstone] ASC)
```

## Server scopeinfo table

The `sync_scope` table disappears from the server side data source.
This **PR** changes the role regarding the management of the `LastSyncTimestamp`. 

Now, the client is responsible of storing the values from both **Server** side and **Local** side:

``` sql
SELECT TOP (1000) [sync_scope_id]
      ,[sync_scope_name]
      ,[sync_scope_schema]
      ,[scope_last_server_sync_timestamp]
      ,[scope_last_sync_timestamp]
      ,[scope_last_sync_duration]
      ,[scope_last_sync]
  FROM [Client].[dbo].[scopeinfo]
```

sync_scope_id | sync_scope_name | sync_scope_schema | scope_last_server_sync_timestamp | scope_last_sync_timestamp | scope_last_sync_duration | scope_last_sync
-------------|---------------------|--------------------|-------------|---------------------|--------------------|--------------------
F6780CB1... | DefaultScope  | { }   |  10001  | 7815753  |  2019-12-27 06:12:15.617


With this new feature, the server is completely independant, and is able to response to any requests, from any clients, and any timestamps requested.


## Less Roundtripts

Today we have at least 6 requests-responses roundtrips:

> 1) BeginSession
> 2) EnsureScopesAsync
> 3) EnsureSchemaAsync
> 4) EnsureDatabaseAsync
> 5) ApplyChangesAsync
> 6) GetLocalTimestampAsync
> 7) GetChangeBatchAsync
> 8) WriteScopesAsync
> 9) EndSessionAsync

It's quite a lot of messages, and so far, a lot of opportunities to fail for various reasons (network and so on)   
Almost all steps has its own transaction, and it could be potentially not safe, if all the steps are not correctly done.


This **PR**  will introduce a new concept of `Orchestrator`.   
An orchestrator is responsible of the communication and need a provider (which is responsible of the datastore)   

At the end, we have now only 2 requests-response:

> 1) EnsureScopeAsync
> 2) ApplyThenGetChangesAsync

Basically, we have **2 transactions** on the client side and only **1 transaction** on the server side.

This PR will include a new **Schema** cache, on the client side.
Once the schema readed from the server, the client will store the schema in its `sync_scopes` table.
So far, we reduce the roundtrip to **1** query:

> 1) ApplyThenGetChangesAsync

Here is a screenshot, comparing `v0.3` and `v0.4`:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4592555/71524769-4d649480-28cf-11ea-9f13-dc524625181c.png)

## Replacing DmSet with SyncSet

`DmSet` is a great object, that simulate a `DataSet`.  
I have created thie object, because at the beginning, `.Net Core 1` did not have the `DataSet`.

Today the `DmSet` is too complicated to handle, especially when optimizing **memory** and **network**

The `SyncSet` object is able to serialize its schema without the datas, and is able to export the datas in a convenient way (using an object called `ContainerSet`)

Here is a comparison, regarding the serialization of the schema :

- **V0.3** : Schema serialization : **45 961 bytes**
- **V0.4** : Schema serialization : **11 580 bytes** 

## Client decides which serializer to use

Client can dictate the serialization mechanism
The client sends a special HTTP header `dotmim-sync-serialization-format`, containing two information:

- First one is specifying the serialization format to use. The server then knows how to deserialize the messages and also uses this serialization format in each response
- Second one is specifying if the client needs batch mode or not.

Example:

```
dotmim-sync-serialization-format: {""f"":""json"",""s"":500}
```
- Serialization : **Json**
- Batch size : **500**


## Options to set a custom serializer

You can now set your own serializer. 
Using the `SyncOptions` instance, the client can define the serializer he wants to use.

The server shoud have the serializer installed as well.

To be able to use a new serializer, you should:
- Implements thes interfaces `ISerializerFactory` and `ISerializer<T>`
- References this serializer on both side (client and server)

Here is an example using a new serializer based on **MessagePack**:


``` csharp
public class CustomMessagePackSerializerFactory : ISerializerFactory
{
    public string Key => ""mpack"";
    public ISerializer<T> GetSerializer<T>() => new CustomMessagePackSerializer<T>();
}

public class CustomMessagePackSerializer<T> : ISerializer<T>
{
    public CustomMessagePackSerializer() => MessagePackSerializer.SetDefaultResolver(MessagePack.Resolvers.ContractlessStandardResolver.Instance);
    public T Deserialize(Stream ms) => MessagePackSerializer.Deserialize<T>(ms);
    public byte[] Serialize(T obj) => MessagePackSerializer.Serialize(obj);
}
```
Add the serializer to the web server serializers collection:
``` csharp
var webServerOptions = new WebServerOptions
{
    UseBulkOperations = ...
};
webServerOptions.Serializers.Add(new CustomMessagePackSerializerFactory());

```

Add the serializer on the client side:
``` csharp
var proxyClientProvider = new WebClientOrchestrator
{
    SerializerFactory = new CustomMessagePackSerializerFactory()
};
```

## Options to set a custom converter

Allows you to convert each row **before being serialized** (when send a request) and **after being deserialized** (when receiving a response)

Like the `ISerializerFactory`, you can implement your own `IConverter`.
- This convert should be available both on the client and the server.
- The server registers all converters used by any client
- The client register its own converter.

``` csharp
public interface IConverter
{

    /// <summary>
    /// get the unique key for this converter
    /// </summary>
    string Key { get; }

    /// <summary>
    /// Convert a row before being serialized
    /// </summary>
    void BeforeSerialize(SyncRow row);

    /// <summary>
    /// Convert a row afeter being deserialized
    /// </summary>
    void AfterDeserialized(SyncRow row);
}
```


Example of a simple `IConverter`:

``` csharp
    public class CustomConverter : IConverter
    {
        public string Key => ""cuscom"";

        public void BeforeSerialize(SyncRow row)
        {
            // Each row belongs to a Table with its own Schema
            // Easy to filter if needed
            if (row.Table.TableName != ""Product"")
                return;

            // Encode a specific column, named ""ThumbNailPhoto""
            if (row[""ThumbNailPhoto""] != null)
                row[""ThumbNailPhoto""] = Convert.ToBase64String((byte[])row[""ThumbNailPhoto""]);

            // Convert all DateTime columns to ticks
            foreach (var col in row.Table.Columns.Where(c => c.GetDataType() == typeof(DateTime)))
            {
                if (row[col.ColumnName] != null)
                    row[col.ColumnName] = ((DateTime)row[col.ColumnName]).Ticks;
            }
        }

        public void AfterDeserialized(SyncRow row)
        {
            // Only convert for table Product
            if (row.Table.TableName != ""Product"")
                return;

            // Decode photo
            row[""ThumbNailPhoto""] = Convert.FromBase64String((string)row[""ThumbNailPhoto""]);

            // Convert all DateTime back from ticks
            foreach (var col in row.Table.Columns.Where(c => c.GetDataType() == typeof(DateTime)))

            }
        }
    }
```

On client side, register this converter from your `WebClientOrchestrator`:

``` csharp
// Create the web proxy client provider with specific options
var proxyClientProvider = new WebClientOrchestrator
{
    SerializerFactory = new CustomMessagePackSerializerFactory(),
    Converter = new CustomConverter()
};

```

On server side, add this converter to the list of available converters:

``` csharp
var webServerOptions = new WebServerOptions
{
   ...
};
webServerOptions.Serializers.Add(new CustomMessagePackSerializerFactory());
webServerOptions.Converters.Add(new CustomConverter());

```

## WebClientOrchestrator


### 1 - HttpClient
To be able to use the last features from **ASP.NET Core**, especially Dependency Injection of `HttpClient`, the `WebClientOrchestrator` is taking an `HttpClient` as parameter

``` csharp
public WebClientOrchestrator(string serviceUri = null, ISerializerFactory serializerFactory = null, HttpClient client = null)
{
}
```

### 2 - Gzip compression

Gzip compression can be used, but is not enabled by default. Use an instance of `HttpClientHandler` and check the `SupportsAutomaticDecompression` property:

``` csharp
var handler = new HttpClientHandler();

if (handler.SupportsAutomaticDecompression)
    handler.AutomaticDecompression = DecompressionMethods.GZip | DecompressionMethods.Deflate;

var httpClient = new HttpClient(handler);

var client = new WebClientOrchestrator(""http://..."", SerializersCollection.JsonSerializer, httpClient);

The reason is the **Update stored procedure**, which does not try to insert the row, if the row does not exist:

``` sql

SET @sync_row_count = @@ROWCOUNT;

```
One possible solution should be to try to insert the row, if the row exist in the tracking table and not in the original table:

``` sql
ALTER PROCEDURE [dbo].[ProductCategory_update]
	@[bla bla bla]
AS
BEGIN
SET @sync_row_count = 0;

UPDATE [ProductCategory]
SET ... [bla bla bla]

-- try to Insert row if not exists in the original table
SET IDENTITY_INSERT [ProductCategory] ON;

INSERT INTO [ProductCategory]
([ProductCategoryID], [ParentProductCategoryID], [Name], [rowguid], [ModifiedDate])
SELECT @ProductCategoryID, @ParentProductCategoryID, @Name, @rowguid, @ModifiedDate
FROM [ProductCategory] [base]
RIGHT JOIN [ProductCategory_tracking] [side]
ON [base].[ProductCategoryID] = [side].[ProductCategoryID]
WHERE ([side].[timestamp] <= @sync_min_timestamp OR [side].[update_scope_id] is not null OR @sync_force_write = 1)
AND ([base].[ProductCategoryID] IS NULL AND [side].[ProductCategoryID] = @ProductCategoryID);


SET IDENTITY_INSERT [ProductCategory] OFF;

First thank you this great sync framework!

I have detected a bug in SQLITE insert trigger. If we insert a record, delete it and insert again (all with same primary key) the sync framework detects that have to insert the record instead of update.

More easy with a example (my client is sqlite and server is sql server):

1. Insert record ID=1 in table A;
2. Sync;
3. Delete record ID=1 in table A;
4. Insert record ID=1 in table A;
5. Sync;

The data are not synced.

I have made a fix for my self (in class SQLiteBuilderTrigger) and maybe you can implemented in this way (I have attached the code)

is there a way  to be able to ""differ"" the sync (maybe with sync configuration parameters but i don't think) ?
As in : get the last changes from the Master server without uploading the new things from the client to the Master.

The idea behind that is to be able to have a kind of ""pending"" work on the client, and only commit it when the user decides it, BUT the client still need to get ""fresh"" datas from the Master regularly. The thing is right now, if we ""sync"" and there's no conflict, everything will be uploaded and downloaded.

As an added (so 2nd) feature to that : while getting the datas from the Master, if there are conflicts, let the client choose ""keep mine"" or ""take server"" but still not commit changes immediately to the Master. Right now it is of course possible to intercept conflicts but that would mean ""postpone"" them and still choose a resolution everytime we would get datas from the Master.

I have multiple tables where I want the client tables to just be exact copies of the server tables. I'm not able to have a direct connection between the databases so I'm trying to accomplish it through an ASP.NET Core API with this library. The only code that should be modifying these tables on the client is the sync feature.

If I could sync with `SyncType.Reinitialize` every time it would probably work, but I can't because it's too costly, both from a performance and data usage standpoint. So I was hoping to accomplish the same result with `SyncType.Normal` but I'm running into issues.

### Configuration details

- The tables all use `SyncDirection.DownloadOnly`
- The conflict resolution is `ServerWins`
- The sync uses `SyncType.Normal`
- The sync is being done through a web service so the `SyncAgent` is using `SqlSyncProvider` for the client and `WebProxyClientProvider` for the server. Both databases are SQL Server.
- I'm creating my own `DmTable` configurations so I can specify a subset of columns for each table. For example:

```csharp
services.AddSyncServer<SqlSyncProvider>(Configuration.GetConnectionString(""Db""), configuration =>
{
    var table = new DmTable(""MyTable"") { Schema = ""dbo"", SyncDirection = SyncDirection.DownloadOnly };
    table.Columns.Add(new DmColumn<int>(""Id""));
    table.Columns.Add(new DmColumn<string>(""SomeValue"") { DbType = DbType.AnsiStringFixedLength, MaxLength = 30 });
    table.PrimaryKey = new DmKey(table.Columns[0]);

    configuration.Add(table);

    var table2 = new DmTable(""MyTable2"") {Schema = ""dbo"", SyncDirection = SyncDirection.DownloadOnly};
    table2.Columns.Add(new DmColumn<int>(""Id1""));
    table2.Columns.Add(new DmColumn<int>(""Id2""));
    table2.Columns.Add(new DmColumn<bool>(""SomeFlag""));
    table2.PrimaryKey = new DmKey(new[] {table2.Columns[0], table2.Columns[1]});

    configuration.Add(table2);

    // etc
});
```

I'm using the latest master branch at the time of writing this ([Oct 8 commit](https://github.com/Mimetis/Dotmim.Sync/tree/40b11e705484d86f4d21a6b212c180d569306110)).

### Issues

Take this scenario

1. Delete 1 or more rows on the server
2. Sync changes (this successfully deletes them on the client)
3. Add back in the deleted row(s) on the server
4. Sync changes (this doesn't add them back on the client)
5. Sync again (doesn't detect any changes, so the row(s) stay missing)

From what I can tell, the change from step 3 is detected and is treated as an update in step 4. Since the row is missing on the client the update query doesn't do anything. This is recorded as a conflict and I believe it attempts an `ApplyAction.RetryWithForceWrite` but that doesn't insert the row and it shows 1 for `TotalSyncConflicts` and 0 for everything else.

Then on subsequent syncs (ie: step 5), it doesn't detect any changes and the `SyncContext` shows 0 for `TotalChangesDownloaded`, `TotalChangesUploaded`, `TotalSyncConflicts`, and `TotalSyncErrors`. So even though it wasn't able to add the row in step 4, it no longer detects that the databases aren't in sync anymore.

- Is there any way to configure it so that an insert query will do an update if the row already exists and an update query will do an insert if the row doesn't exist?
- Is there a way to configure it so that the metadata doesn't change if there's a sync error/conflict so the changes will be detected/retried on subsequent syncs?",NA,FALSE,https://api.github.com/repos/Mimetis/Dotmim.Sync,https://api.github.com/repos/Mimetis/Dotmim.Sync/issues/173/labels{/name},https://api.github.com/repos/Mimetis/Dotmim.Sync/issues/173/comments,https://api.github.com/repos/Mimetis/Dotmim.Sync/issues/173/events,https://github.com/Mimetis/Dotmim.Sync/issues/173,NA

Say client A inserts a row R1 locally and synchronizes with the server S.
The sync works perfectly but when A tries to store the scope_last_sync_timestamp locally, it crashes.

So now we've got row R1 inserted on the client and the server, but client A does not know that anymore.

- In case client A synchronizes the next time, R1 is transmitted as INSERT to the server again, which rejects the INSERT as the row already exists.
That is basically no problem.

BUT (and there is always a but...)
- In case the row R1 is **updated** on the client, before it synchronizes, then the client will determine, that R1 still has to be transmitted as INSERT to the server (even though there was actually an update on the row.)
This is due to the following code in CoreProvider.GetChanges.cs `GetStateFromDmRow`:
```csharp
  
else if (scopeInfo.IsNewScope || (isLocallyCreated && createdTimeStamp >= scopeInfo.Timestamp))
                    dmRowState = DmRowState.Added;

```

I am working on syncing a legacy web app with a mobile app.  Changing the IDs to GUIDs is not an option as the legacy app is closed. So I have to work with integer IDs in both places (server and client). The one issue that I'm facing, though, is that sometimes the client and the server could create a new entity with the same ID. At the time of conflict, with the default configuration, the server wins and the changes from the client get lost. 

So I was picturing a solution in which a new record is inserted into the server table if the client and the server have the same integer ID. Right after, the new ID generated on the server is replaced on the client. However, I did not get very far. Debugging the code, I noticed that the logic to handle  conflicts is found in the HandleConflictAsync method on the CoreProvider.ApplyChanges class. According to the code, only if the update is not successful, an insert will take place.
`isUpdated = syncAdapter.ApplyUpdate(row, scope, true);

                        if (!isUpdated)
                        {
                            // Insert the row
                            isInserted = syncAdapter.ApplyInsert(row, scope, true);`

Could you please give me some pointers as to how to implement that feature.

Another solution that I explored was to create a LocalId field on each entity in the client and to set the Id as a nullable. However, the fields with null IDs don't get added to the tracking tables. The behavior that I would like would be as follows:

If ID on client is NULL
    insert data into server and send back to client the new ID that was created on server.

I know the schemas have to match. However, the fact that the ID is set to nullable on the client doesn't seem to bother Dotmim.Sync.

Let's assume we have two tables: 
- Order
- OrderDetail

Now OrderDetail has a foreign key which points to Order.
For that reason, we have to configure the sync as such, that the Order table is synchronized first, and the OrderDetail table thereafter.
Otherwise, it could happen that the sync process tries to insert an OrderDetail for an Order which does not exist in the local database yet.

So far so good. According to the current implementation, each sync process goes as follows:
For each table:
1. insert all new rows
2. update all changed rows
3. delete all tombstoned rows

This brings us to the following problem.
Let's assume, that we delete an Order and the OrderDetail that references it.
What happens is
For the Order table:
1. all new rows are inserted
2. all changed rows are updated
3. the database refuses to delete the Order, because the OrderDetail is still referencing it (it has not been deleted yet)

So what should happen is:
For each table:
1. insert all new rows
2. update all changed rows

This is just an open list of performance improvements that can be implemented.
Some of them were already implemented by us in our branch as we had some serious issues #154 . Hopefully, we'll find the time to send you PRs eventually.


1. fix #154 
2. ObjectNameConverter could cache its instances based on the input text. With 1000 rows synced in our test, this reduced the `ParseString` calls from over 9000 to 34.
3. Reduce the number of request-response roundtrips between client and server. In the best case, it'd be just one request response if batching is disabled (Have a look at the [fallacies of distributed computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacies_of_distributed_computing) to understand why)
4. Reuse the DbCommands that come from `DbSyncAdapter.GetCommand` and just re-apply the parameters. This greatly improves performance as the command text does not have to be parsed anymore, which has a huge impact on mobile devices using SQLite (see: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/670407/reusing-sqlcommand and [example by microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.data.sqlclient.sqlcommand.prepare?redirectedfrom=MSDN&view=netframework-4.8#System_Data_SqlClient_SqlCommand_Prepare))
5. ScopeInfoBuilder should not read **all** scopes, but only the local scope and the client scope (if `ClientReferenceId` is provided). Currently, if 2000 clients were ever connected to the server, 1998 rows are loaded into memory for nothing!
6. cache the database table schema so unnecessary `ReadSchemaAsync` calls are avoided.
7. SyncAgent - instead of downloading all batches first, and applying them later, while downloading the next batch, apply the current one
8. SyncAgend - support different BatchSizeInKB for uploads and downloads, because the upload bandwidth of a network is most of the time much more limited than the download bandwidth.

Especially on Xamarin.Andoid, the garbage collector is very slow.

we have some weird issues in our system.
**Scenario**
Users get a task and once they compete it, they are to flag them as completed and then synchronize so the server gets the status update as well.

**Problem**
the sync never gives us any errors but sometimes (very rarely - like once in a week) one to two tasks are marked as completed on the client, but are still new on the server.
Even though we did a fresh sync.
Now we went through the code and it is impossible that this is due to a sync conflit: There are no foreign key constraints that could be violated, nor is there any way the task could have changed on the server.

**Solution**
So I am having this weird feeling, that there may be an issue with the timestamp handling on the client side. I am currently investigating and try to do a PR if I find an issue.

However, I do not completely understand the select changed query on sqlite. Could you please explain it a little more?
I took the query form the integration tests sample.

for better exception handling and for fixing problem faster, it would be neat if the thrown exception would include more precise messages. 
For example:

> Table {TableDescription.TableName} must have at least one dmColumn as Primary key""

Is thrown often within CreateTable, CreateForeignKeys, CreateTriggers.. it would be good if the taken action is included within the message, so the developer knows what excactly went wrong (or at least at which action)

Suggestion: 

> Create database: Table {TableDescription.TableName} must have at least one dmColumn as Primary key""

> Create trigger: Table {TableDescription.TableName} must have at least one dmColumn as Primary key""


Another example:

> There is already an open DataReader associated with this Command which must be closed first

This actually tells me that a second reader is activated. Either ""MultipleActiveResultSets=true;"" is not set or the tables are synchronized in the wrong order, right? 

Suggestion if MultipleActiveResultSets=false:

> There is already an open DataReader associated with this Command which must be closed first. Try setting MultipleActiveResultSets to true.

Suggestion if MultipleActiveResultSets=true:

> There is already an open DataReader associated with this Command which must be closed first. Seems like you specified a wrong order for you tables. Check your constraints and reorder the tables in your configuration.

In accordance to this problem, wouldn't it be nice if you must not specify all tables that you wish to be synced? Like, if I pass null or do not specify any table, all tables should be synced?

The above error occurs when the client applied the schemas and checked for updates, so to say after the last table. 
I could fix it by simply assigning a new SyncOptions objec to each the serverProxyProvider and clientProxyProvider. Although I'm wondering, because the SyncOptions are automatically set to an instance when creating a SyncAgent. However, I found out that the Options property is null and therefore an exception is thrown at this line:
`if (this.Options.BatchSize > 0 && !string.IsNullOrEmpty(this.Options.BatchDirectory) && !Directory.Exists(this.Options.BatchDirectory))`


Another error was ARG_NullException, but I couldn't reproduce this error and VS crashed when this error blew up.. maybe it was even caused by VS, who knows.

i'm trying to implement the library into my current project, but as soon as the client hits the point ""agent.SynchronizeAsync()"", the client shuts down without any error and exception.
I followed the example from the web page: https://mimetis.github.io/Dotmim.Sync/Web

The client is an usual .NET Core console project and a lot of PDBs are missing like:
""C:\Program Files\dotnet\shared\Microsoft.NETCore.App\2.1.7\System.Diagnostics.DiagnosticSource.dll""

Actually, I don't wanna have another web app just to be able to synchronize. Can't I simply use a console program for the client?

```

Some propertiers from the `SyncConfiguration` object have been migrated to this new `SyncOptions` object:

### Before

``` csharp
public class SyncConfiguration
    {
        public ConflictResolutionPolicy ConflictResolutionPolicy { get; set; }
        public DmSet Schema{ get; set; }
        public string BatchDirectory { get; set; }

        public SerializationFormat SerializationFormat { get; set; }
        public bool UseVerboseErrors { get; set; }
        public bool UseBulkOperations { get; set; } 
        public bool CleanMetadatas { get; set; } 
        public string ScopeName { get; set; }
        public ICollection<FilterClause> Filters { get; set; }
        public string StoredProceduresPrefix { get; set; }
        public string StoredProceduresSuffix { get; set; }
        public string TriggersPrefix { get; set; }
        public string TriggersSuffix { get; set; }
        public string TrackingTablesPrefix { get; set; }
        public string TrackingTablesSuffix { get; set; }
        public string ScopeInfoTableName { get; set; } 
}
```

### After

``` csharp
public class SyncConfiguration
    {
        public ConflictResolutionPolicy ConflictResolutionPolicy { get; set; } 
        public DmSet Schema{ get; set; }
        public SerializationFormat SerializationFormat { get; set; }
        public string ScopeName { get; set; }
        public ICollection<FilterClause> Filters { get; set; }
        public string StoredProceduresPrefix { get; set; }
        public string StoredProceduresSuffix { get; set; }
        public string TriggersPrefix { get; set; }
        public string TriggersSuffix { get; set; }
        public string TrackingTablesPrefix { get; set; }
        public string TrackingTablesSuffix { get; set; }
        public string ScopeInfoTableName { get; set; } 
}
```

``` csharp
  public class SyncOptions
    {
        public string BatchDirectory { get; set; }
        public int BatchSize { get; set; }
        public bool UseVerboseErrors { get; set; }

        public bool CleanMetadatas { get; set; } = true;
    }
```

The main difference between these two objects are:
* `SyncConfiguration` is shared between server and client. Each property **must be exactly the same** on client and server 
-- For instance `SerializationFormat` can't be `Json` on server and `Binary` on client
* `SyncOptions` can be customized on server and on client, with their own different values.
-- For instance, we can have a different value for the the `BatchDirectory` (representing the tmp directory when batch is enabled) on server and on client.

If nothing is supplied, a default `SyncOptions` is created with default values.

- Deploy AdventureWorks db to SQL Server
- Sync to Sqlite db on client
- Create a new Product row in AdventureWorks SQL Server db
- Sync new Product to client db
- Create a new ProductCategory on client db
- Set the ProductCategoryID FK on the new Product to be the new ProductCategory on client db
- Sync back to the server
- Inspect the new Product row and observe ProductCategoryID FK is NULL on the server db. It should have been updated.

I traced the problem to the order of Update and Insert. Each of these actions occurs in table order as expected. However a FK constraint exception occurred on the server side when a FK update was executed on the Product row before the insert of the new ProductCategory row. The solution would be to execute both Update and Insert for a given table in order and not all Updates in order then all Inserts in order. 

The problem was difficult to find because everything looked correct from the client side. One row was created and one updated. However the FK constraint exception was silently eaten on the server side. A conflict was logged on the server side but this is not actually a conflict. The server side should throw the exception so that the client is notified of the problem.

@Mimetis happy to put up a PR. I have made some changes and created a test on my fork which I think will work.

What I decided to do is to set up a daily scheduled background job to locally create a database ""dump"", which could then be downloaded normally and used on clients.

* On the client side, you may have edited some customer data, which is still open in your view.
* During the sync, the customer record you just edited is rejected by the server (as some guy modified that employee first)
* So Dotmim.Sync sends back the server-record of the customer which is then used to update the clients database.

The problem is:
as there is no callback on the client side, that some conflicting records have been downloaded, we have to reload all user interfaces every time we synchronized with dotmim.sync.
Even if we do so, the user may not realize that all his/her changes have just been overruled by some other data.

=> it would be great to get some ""Progress"" callbacks on the client side, where the downloaded and (most importantly) conflicting records can be examined.
Then we could fire UI notifications and the like.

The same would be great on the server side where we could modify/accept/reject any records received by a client application.

Server: WebProxyServer
Client: Xamarin.Android app

Steps to reproduce:
1. Add sync server with one table
`services.AddSyncServer<MySqlSyncProvider>(connectionString, configuration =>
            {
                configuration.Add(new []
                {
                    ""Table1""
                });
            });`

2. Synchronize on client
`await _syncAgent.SynchronizeAsync();`

3. Add a new table to the configuration
`services.AddSyncServer<MySqlSyncProvider>(connectionString, configuration =>
            {
                configuration.Add(new []
                {
                    ""Table1"",
                    ""Table2""
                });
            });`

4. Synchronize on client like this
`await _syncAgent.SynchronizeAsync();`
or like this
`await _syncAgent.SynchronizeAsync(SyncType.Reinitialize);`

5. Get the exception - ""MySql.Data.MySqlClient.MySqlException (0x80004005): PROCEDURE mydb.Table2_selectchanges does not exist""

I suppose the logic is that one has to deprovision to add a new table.
But how do you do that if you are using the WebProxyServer?

Also, the same thing happens if you add a new filter to the configuration after you have synchronized once.
`configuration.Filters.Add(new FilterClause(""Table1"", ""Id""));`

Need your help on the **filter** behavior. 

_But first of all, take a chair, a coffee, turn on spotify on your best music of the day, and breath..._ 

Today we are able to filter on table that have a direct link to the parent table.   
But if we habe a 2nd (or more) deep level of filter it's impossible to filter values (or you have to duplicate the key on all tables involved in the filter)

_This issue is a discussion, I'm writing what I actually think and a lot of things could changed over time :)_

## Example (of failure)

Let's imagine this scenario : We have a `Customer` table who have `Address` through a `CustomerAddress` many to many relations.

Those customers are linked to `Employee`  (each customer has one employee and one employee could potentially have several customers)

> **Employee** :                       **EmployeeID** / FirstName / LastName
> |-> **Customer** :                 **CustomerID** / **EmployeeID** / FirstName / LastName
> |---->**CustomerAddress** : **CustomerID** / **AddressID**
> |------->**Address** :            **AddressID** / City / State / PostalCode
> 

The SQL Tables (simplified) could be something like that:

``` sql
CREATE TABLE [dbo].[Employee](
	[EmployeeId] [int] IDENTITY(1,1) NOT NULL,
	[FirstName] [nvarchar](50) NOT NULL,
	[LastName] [nvarchar](50) NOT NULL)

CREATE TABLE [dbo].[Customer](
	[CustomerID] [uniqueidentifier] NOT NULL,
	[EmployeeID] [int] NOT NULL,
	[FirstName] [nvarchar](50) NOT NULL,
	[LastName] [nvarchar](50) NOT NULL)

CREATE TABLE [dbo].[Address](
	[AddressID] [int] IDENTITY(1,1) NOT NULL,
	[AddressLine1] [nvarchar](max) NOT NULL,
	[City] [nvarchar](30) NOT NULL)

CREATE TABLE [dbo].[CustomerAddress](
	[CustomerID] [uniqueidentifier] NOT NULL,
	[AddressID] [int] NOT NULL,
	[AddressType] [nvarchar](50) NOT NULL)

```

## How it works (and fails) today

**Imagine we want to synchronization, per device, only customers belonging to one employee** .

Today, we can do something like that, in `Dotmim.Sync`:

```csharp
// On the server side, we had the filter
var filterClause1 = new FilterClause(""Employee"", ""EmployeeID"");
var filterClause2 = new FilterClause(""Customer"", ""EmployeeID"");

// On the client side, we had the SyncParameter for the device 
// Let's say we want only employee with ID = 1
var paramEmployee = new SyncParameter(""Employee"", ""EmployeeID"", 1)
var paramCustomer = new SyncParameter(""Customer"", ""EmployeeID"", 1)

```
It's fine for the `Employee` table and also for the `Customer` table.

But it won't work for the `Address` and `CustomerAddress`.
Eventually it will fail, because we should have in the `CustomerAddress` some rows that are referencing employees that are not present because of the filter.

## A solution to discuss

Ok, so we want to be able to sync all the tables linked (more or less) to one employee.

We have to refactor (and introduce some breaking changes, I guess) the `FilterClause` and `SyncParameter` classes, and the **SQL** generation as well.

### SyncParameter
In my mind, we should be able to inject a parameter, without any verification on its corresponding column on any table. This will allow us to create some **Virtual Parameter**

Since we don't have any resolution based on the name, this parameter should be:
- Typed on server side
- Just a Name / Value on client

On server side, let's say we can use a `DmColumn` to create this parameter, and use all the `DmColumn` properties to precise length, unicode, null, precision, scale ....
This column will be part of all `FilterClause` which need it

``` csharp
// Create the parameter that will be in the stored procedure parameter
var pEmpId = DmColumn.CreateColumn(""empId"", typeof(Int32));
pEmpId.AllowDbNull = true;
```
On client side, just set a `SyncParameter` with the correct name and its value

``` csharp
// We want all rows for the employee with EmployeeId = 1
var syncParameter new SyncParameter(""empId"", 1)
```

This parameter will generate a **SQL** variable, like `@empId int = null`

### FilterClause

Today the `FilterClause` creates a parameter that has the same name as the column name we want to filter.   
```csharp
var filterClause1 = new FilterClause(""Employee"", ""EmployeeID"");
```
Now that we have a `DmColumn`, with no restriction, the new `filterClause` will be something like

``` csharp
// create the parameter
var pEmpId = DmColumn.CreateColumn(""empId"", typeof(Int32));
// create the filter clause
var customerFilter = new FilterClause(pEmpId);
```
this `customerFilter` will generate something like that, in the stored procedure declaration:

```sql
ALTER PROCEDURE [dbo].[Customer_empId_selectchanges]
	@sync_min_timestamp bigint,
	@sync_scope_id uniqueidentifier,
	@sync_scope_is_new bit,
	@sync_scope_is_reinit bit,
	@empId int = null
```
Now we have the in-parameter, we need to say to the `FilterClause` which table we want to filter.

I tried to get the most intuitive solution, and I guess, using some sort of **Fluent API** should work.

Let's say we want to **FILTER** the `Customer` table **ON** the `EmployeeId` column. Using a **Fluent API** style, we could do something like
```csharp
customerFilter.Filter(""Customer"").On(""EmployeeId"");
```

Going forward, for a 2nd level table, let's say for `CustomerAddress`, we want to **FILTER** `CustomerAddress` which **JOIN** `Customer` that will filter **ON** then `EmployeeId` column:
```csharp
custAddFilter.Filter(""CustomerAddress"")
                     .Join(""Customer"")
                     .On(""EmployeeId"");

```
And then, eventually for the last level `Address`, we can do something like:

``` csharp
addressFilter1.Filter(""Address"")
                       .Join(""CustomerAddress"")
                       .Join(""Customer"")
                       .On(""EmployeeId"");
```

## Final sample code

Here is my final code, I want to be able to implement, which will filter all **Customers** and all **Orders** related to one filtered **Employee**
```csharp
// Create the parameter that will be in the stored procedure parameter
var pEmpId = DmColumn.CreateColumn(""empId"", typeof(Int32));
pEmpId.AllowDbNull = true;

// Filter table Customer on EmployeeID = @empID
FilterClause customerFilter = new FilterClause(pEmpId);
customerFilter.Filter(""Customer"")
                .On(""EmployeeId"");

// Filter on CustomerAddress that will Join Customer that will filter on EmployeeID = @empID
FilterClause customerAddressFilter = new FilterClause(pEmpId);
customerAddressFilter.Filter(""CustomerAddress"")
                    .Join(""Customer"")
                    .On(""EmployeeId"");

// 1st Filter on Address that will Join CustomerAddress that will join Customer that will filter on EmployeeID = @empID
FilterClause addressFilterOnCustomer = new FilterClause(pEmpId);
addressFilterOnCustomer.Filter(""Address"")
                .Join(""CustomerAddress"")
                .Join(""Customer"")
                .On(""EmployeeId"");

// 2nd Filter on Addres that will join EmployeeAddress that will filter on EmployeeID = @empID
FilterClause addressFilterOnEmployee = new FilterClause(pEmpId);
addressFilterOnEmployee.Filter(""Address"")
                .Join(""EmployeeAddress"")
                .On(""EmployeeId"");


// Filter on Employee that will filter on EmployeeID = @empID
FilterClause2 employeeFilter = new FilterClause2(pEmpId);
employeeFilter.Filter(""Employee"").On(""EmployeeId"");

// Filter on EmployeeAddress that will filter on EmployeeID = @empID
FilterClause2 employeeAddressFilter = new FilterClause2(pEmpId);
employeeAddressFilter.Filter(""EmployeeAddress"").On(""EmployeeId"");

// Filter on SalesOrderHeader that will Join Customer that will filter on EmployeeID = @empID
FilterClause2 sohFilter = new FilterClause2(pEmpId);
sohFilter.Filter(""SalesLT.SalesOrderHeader"")
                .Join(""Customer"")
                .On(""EmployeeId"");

// Filter on SalesOrderDetails that will Join SalesOrderHeader Customer that will filter on EmployeeID = @empID
FilterClause2 sodFilter = new FilterClause2(pEmpId);
sodFilter.Filter(""SalesLT.SalesOrderDetail"")
                .Join(""SalesLT.SalesOrderHeader"")
                .Join(""Customer"")
                .On(""EmployeeId"");

// Customer , CustomerAddress, Address
Agent.Configuration.Filters.Add(customerFilter);
Agent.Configuration.Filters.Add(customerAddressFilter);
Agent.Configuration.Filters.Add(addressFilterOnCustomer);

// Employee, EmployeeAddress, Address
Agent.Configuration.Filters.Add(employeeFilter);
Agent.Configuration.Filters.Add(employeeAddressFilter);
Agent.Configuration.Filters.Add(addressFilterOnEmployee);

// SalesOrderHeader, SalesOrderDetail
Agent.Configuration.Filters.Add(sohFilter);
Agent.Configuration.Filters.Add(sodFilter);


```


## Considerations

#### Breaking changes
This change coud introduce breaking changes in your code

#### Foreign keys constraints
Since we don't need to precise the relationships in the **Fluent API** all joins will be based on the foreign keys constraints from the server database.   
So It can't work without them.

#### Tracking tables
To be able to retrieve deleted rows through all the tables level , I must use the tracking tables.   
So all tracking tables will have new columns : all foreign key columns.   
For example, the `Customer` table has a foreign key to `Employee`, so the tracking table will look like:
``` sql
CREATE TABLE [dbo].[Customer_tracking](
	[CustomerID] [uniqueidentifier] NOT NULL,
	[create_scope_id] [uniqueidentifier] NULL,
	[update_scope_id] [uniqueidentifier] NULL,
	[create_timestamp] [bigint] NULL,
	[update_timestamp] [bigint] NULL,
	[timestamp] [timestamp] NULL,
	[sync_row_is_tombstone] [bit] NOT NULL,
	[last_change_datetime] [datetime] NULL,
	[EmployeeID] [int] NULL,
```

#### TSQL generation

TSQL generation will be complex for all `_SelectChanges` stored procedures, involving a lot of relations, and maybe a `UNION` when we had multiple `FilterClause` on the same table

#### Do we have to create the filters on the **clients** databases ? 
Today, the filters are created on both side, essentially because the code on server and on client is exactly the same.   
Introducing this kind of exceptions could have a huge impact on the overall architecture

#### Sql generation on client
In the other side, if we allow injecting **SQL** in the stored procedures, well we should make a SQL generation for each of the clients (the SQL for SQL Server is not the same as the SQL used in SQLite for instance)

#### What about Virtual Filters
I did not (yet) study the new virtual filters introduce by @gentledepp.  
Do you think it's compatible ?

Guyz, any feedback will be a gift :)

The following suggestion is a bit based on the problems described in issue #86 - namely if we wanted to support a versioning of the `SyncConfiguration`.

With the *old sync framework* it was usually the case, that, once you had your sync context setup (with all tables etc.) you could not change those tables anymore - or at least only with huge effort.

The basic feature description is:

*Allow the application developer to specify a version on a sync context and once a client connects with a different version (or lower), it reinitializes but tries to upload any changes first*

There are some ""simple"" scenarios, however, where versioning support would be **awesome**:

**Scenario 1**
The maximum period that a client is allowed to stay disconnected to a sync scope is - by default - 14 days.
Now when already in production, we realize, that we need to extend that period to (e.g.) 3 months.
What should happen then, is that a client, which synchronzies again after 15+ days, gets the new period (3 months) through the sync configuration and thus decides to just continue synchronizing data incrementally. After a disconnection period of 3 months. however, it should synchronize as `ReinitializeWithUpload`.
Basically, this scenario would not require the application developer to raise the version of the `SyncConfiguration`, as the disconnection period should be transmitted anyways.

**Scenario 2**
We add another column to a table.
In that case, the application developer wants to make sure, that all clients will get that data, so she raises the version of the `SyncConfiguration` object to `2`.
Once a client with version `1` synchronizes again, it notices the raised version, and thus runs the sync process as `ReinitializeWithUpload`.
Of course, Dotmim.Sync would then need to be able to alter existing table definitions (only add columns - deletion or modification to a stricter mode (e.g. make a column non nullable) cannot be supported as it would break existing clients)

**Scenario 3**
We add another table to the scope.
In that case, the application developer wants to make sure, that all clients get that data, so again the version of the `SyncConfiguration` is raised to `3`
So once a client connects, which is running version 1 or version 2, it runs the sync process as `ReinitializeWithUpload`, and thus also gets the new table.

I guess these scenarios are the ones that we missed the most, when it comes to maintain an application that is using the microsoft sync framework.

Do you agree, that these scenarios should be doable and included?

I am currently struggling with getting the unit- and integration tests to work on my dev machine.
In order to help others getting started, I created a simple powershell script which installs MySQL using chocolatey. 5.x is the only MySQL version available there, this is why I came across this bug:
```

# install chocolatey
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))

#install mysql
cinst mysql -y

#set initial root user password to be the one used by dotmim sync
mysqladmin -u root password azerty31$
```

Running ""MySqlAllColumnsTests.OneRowFromServer"" leads to an error:
The CDateTime value is
Expected: 2010-10-01T23:10:12.4000000
Actual:   2010-10-01T23:10:12.0000000'

The reason for that is that in MySQL 5.x, you need to specify the precision ""6"" in order to include milliseconds.
I.e. ""DATETIME (6)""
see: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/fractional-seconds.html

I added a hacky fix to ""MySqlDbMetadata"" to fix this UT:
```

            var typeName = GetStringFromDbType(dbType);
            if (IsTextType(typeName))
            {
                string lowerType = typeName.ToLowerInvariant();
                switch (lowerType)

See below for details and proposed fix.

### Setup
#### Server appSettings.json
```
  ""Sync"": {
    ""ConnectionString"": ""Data Source=DESKTOP-BSIVU73;Initial Catalog=AdventureWorks;Trusted_Connection=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=true"",
    ""Filters"": {
      ""Address"": ""StateProvince""
    },
    ""Tables"": [
        ""Address""
```

#### Client code
```
	var clientProvider = new SqliteSyncProvider(dbPath);
	var proxyClientProvider = new WebProxyClientProvider(new Uri(endPoint + ""/sync""));
	var agent = new SyncAgent(clientProvider, proxyClientProvider);
	agent.Parameters.Add(""Address"", ""StateProvince"", ""Texas"");
```

### Testing
When I do a full (no db) or incremental sync I get the following error:
``` 
Dotmim.Sync.SyncException: Bad Request ---> System.Exception: Bad Request
   at Dotmim.Sync.Web.HttpRequestHandler.<ProcessRequest>d__25`1.MoveNext()
```

The exception was thrown from the server side in CoreProvider.GetChanges:
```
	EnumerateChangesInBatchesInternal
	...
	var parameter = context.Parameters.FirstOrDefault(p => p.ColumnName.Equals(filter.ColumnName, StringComparison.InvariantCultureIgnoreCase) && p.TableName.Equals(filter.TableName, StringComparison.InvariantCultureIgnoreCase));
```
because `Parameters(p => p.TableName)`  is `null` 

I tracked this down to property `SyncParameter.TableName`. It doesn't have a setter and therefore could not be deserialized by `WebProxyClientProvider`

### Fix
The fix is simply change `SyncParameter.TableName` property from: 
`public string TableName { get; }` 
to 
`public string TableName { get; set; }`

Looks like a simple typo.

In all the documentation, what I could find were samples of a sync process where you include one or more tables.

Is it also possible to sync two tables in a separate sync scope?
E.g.:
We have some table which contains all buildings of a company.
Then there is another table containing tasks for a particular user.

Now the scenario would be, that buildings need to be synchronized far less often (e.g. every day), while tasks need to be synchronized every 10 minutes.

In order to achieve that, we'd split the sync process into two separate ones, ans also provide two separate rest endpoints for the synchronization (e.g. /sync/buildungs and /sync/tasks)

Is that - will that ever by - supported?

I just noticed, that e.g. with dotmim.sync.web, the default setting for versioning is still active. 
Meaning, whenever I create a new version of the nuget package, both, the **assembly version** and the **assembly file version** are raised.

Raising the assembly version lead to numerous problems in the past, especially in the context of strong names.

So I would suggest we keep the assembly version at 1.0 by default and only raise the assembly file version.
That way, the versioning stuff could be handled by nuget entirely (referencing specific minimum versions of packages)

The samples and tests of dotmim.sync use different databases: Adventureworks, Contoso, etc.

- While for AdventureWorks there is a sql script to generate the database, this is missing from the others and it is kind of hard to find Contoso these days.
- Moreover, the sample databases only work for MSSQL, not MySql, PostgreSQL, etc.
- And there is another issue with the unittests: Some tests restore a database from a backup. However, the command uses the fixed path ""C:\users\mimentis\......"" which does not exist on every PC.

My proposal:
- [ ] Use the same sql sample database for all databases. I would suggest [**chinook**](https://github.com/lerocha/chinook-database)
- [ ] Provide the database with sql scripts, as they can be checked in and versioned correctly. Those sql scripts should then also be used in the integration tests

I get an exception when attempting to sync an association or join table that defines a many-to-many relationship between two other tables. DotMim.Sync expects the association table to contain at least one column that is not a PK. The problem is an association table typically contains just two PKs.

When I sync with the below setup I get exception:

`NotSupportedException(""PostTag does not contains any columns, excepting primary keys."")` 

I could create a superfluous column in the association table to keep Dotmim.Sync happy but that would be bad. It would be better to permit just syncing of PK data without the requirement of at least one non PK column.  

Hope it is easy to fix.

I have a table I cannot sync from SQL Server. It contains an Identity column that is not a PK. DotMim.Sync thinks the column should be synchronized however the update trigger fails with SqlException(""Cannot update identity column 'Id'""). The insert trigger looks fine because IDENTITY_INSERT is enabled for inserts. 

Is it possible skip Identity columns in update triggers? Is there a better solution other than modifying the schema? 

This issue is similar to constraint problems encountered in https://github.com/Mimetis/Dotmim.Sync/issues/44 but in my case all updates fail.

I am trying to synchronize Azure SQL database and local SQLite database. Server database is containing data (around 80MB) and SQLite should be created during the process. I use SqlSyncProvider and SqliteSyncProvider.

It has problem with proper provisioning. In original setting it always ends by exception _""Execution Timeout Expired.  The timeout period elapsed prior to completion of the operation or the server is not responding.""_ during the **DatabaseApplying** phase. Setting properties DownloadBatchSizeInKB, ConnectTimeout, LoadBalanceTimeout doesn't help.

Temporary solution is to delete data in bigger tables (over 1K of records), selectively execute provisioning on server tables, get back data and then synchronize. Is timeout properly set in library? Or there are other ways except ConnectTimeout, LoadBalanceTimeout? It seems, that problem is between library and connection objects.

I recently came up with multiple sync scenarios that cause me some headache.
In both cases, there might not be an actual sync conflict (by two users editing the same row), but constraint violations.

#Scenario 1:
We have a list of tasks in our system. Those tasks (somebody has to do something until the date xy) can be created via our web UI. But additionally, they can come from an external system which utilizes our REST API.
Now for those systems to identify their tasks, we provide a special column ""reference"" which is an arbitrary 120 character string. The only requirement is, that it is unique. 
We ensure this - obviously - using a database constraint.

However, now it can happen, that two users add a new task with the same value for ""reference"". So although both tasks have unique primary keys, there will be constraint violation error.

My question: Are there any sync tactics to overcome these problems? What would you do to solve this kind of problem with Dotmim.Sync?

#Scenario 2
Say you have some masterdata (list of equipments) that you store in a historized fashion.
Meaning: Each row identifying an equipment has a ValidFrom and ValidTo column.
Now whenever an equipment is modified, a new row is added to the table with [ValidFrom = getutcdate()] and validTo = infinity. And the ""old"" record is updated to [ValidTo = getutcdate()]

Now say you sync this table to your clients.

Both clients A and B update an existing equipment, thereby creating a new row each.
How would you solve this sync conflict?

I recently stumbled across a shortcoming of Microsoft Sync Framework again and wanted to know if this was fixed in doxmim sync.

With Sync Framework, you had to 
* locally provision the sync tables (in the client sqlite database)
* start an initial sync with the server
=> only then it was possible, to alter data in the client sqlite database and push those changes back to the server.

If you added data before the initial sync with the server, you'd get a ""serverBlob is null"" exception.

But sometimes, a user has some app, which is not yet connected to a server and (s)he adds data anyways. When online again, (s)he naturally wants to push those changes to the server nontheless.

It would be better if we could provide a reference column from the table to be synced on which synchronization would work. For e.g. we are generating a unique column in addition to auto generated primary key in the table.
Let me explain the scenario why we need this;

Lets say we have three offline databases A, B and C which needs to be synchronized to a central database X.

When we add data to a table, it will auto generate data in primary key column. so offline databases A, B and C will generate their own data in a table and these data needs to union and stored in database X, which generates its own primary key data in the column.

So, when we sync the data from either A, B or C to database X, it overwrites the data on X with the same primary key. So Lets say there is a table City in all the databases and the first row in each database is as follows:
ID 1 in A: NYC
ID 1 in B: Sydney
ID 1 in C: Delhi

Now every time I sync the data from the last one to sync will overwrite the data at ID 1 in X.

What i need is
ID 1 in X: NYC
ID 2 in X: Sydney
ID 3 in X: Delhi

Kindly suggest a work around or the already implemented feature in your marvellous project.

Yesterday, I was working on a software based on SyncWinrt, and I remembered, that it has a quite significant issue:

It requires us to run SQL scripts at setup time, so the synchronization can actually work.

Seems you are making great progress here! It really looks awesome!
I went through the wiki, and saw the schema option:
https://github.com/Mimetis/Dotmim.Sync/wiki/04-Sql-Server-provider-:-Schema

I know a CMS called ""Orchard"" (Orchard Core is now the vnext in beta) which also supports a wide range of sql databases and requires something like a schema where it is not supported (mysql, sqlite, etc.)

Here, they simply use the schema name as prefix (e.g. with an underscore)

So in the example 
`agent.Configuration[""Address""].Schema = ""SalesLT"";`


On sqlite thos could become something like
`SalesLT_Address`

This could also be configurable:
* enable/disable prefixes  (for compatibility reasons, I think the no brainer option would be to add these prefixes by default for all tables that do not belong to the [dbo] schema)
* [optionally] define how the prefix schould be calculated (Func<string, string>) so that I could:
   use another concatenator than underscore, or uppercase/lowercase the whole schemaname

Actually, I have switched the base `Sqlite` provider from  `System.Data.Sqlite` to `Microsoft.Data.Sqlite`.

For references, you will find usefuls informations from those two `SQLite` providers here:
* [Microsoft.Data.Sqlite](https://github.com/aspnet/Microsoft.Data.Sqlite)
* [System.Data.Sqlite](http://system.data.sqlite.org)

## Why ?

* `System.Data.Sqlite` is not (yet) `.Net Standard` compliant. Actually, it works, thanks to the .net standard shim system, but in many ways, it's also painful in some situations.
* `Microsoft.Data.Sqlite` is a leightweight version, developed by @bricelam from the **Entity Framework** team.

## Impact and breaking changes

One of the most impactful issue comes from the `Guid` behavior in `Sqlite`. Actually, it's stored as `blob` by default in SQLite.  

`System.Data.Sqlite` allows you to specify a `BinaryGUID` directive to be able to store `Guid` as `String`.   
This behavior **is not** a SQLite behavior, just a system flag managed by `System.Data.Sqlite` 

`Microsoft.Data.Sqlite` does not allow us to add any parameter on the connection string.  
See why here : 
* [Add BinaryGUID connection string to select binary/string GUID storage](https://github.com/aspnet/Microsoft.Data.Sqlite/pull/363)
* [Connection string settings](https://github.com/aspnet/Microsoft.Data.Sqlite/issues/354)

So, Every SQLite databases will now be generated with `blob` data type for every `Guid` type.

**If you want to use the last version (and you have to !) You have to regenerate your SQLite databases.**   
The breaking changes from a `string` to a `blob` type for any `Guid` is not compatible.


## Tips


### Requesting a guid stored as a blob

If you are Inside a .Net application, using `Microsoft.Data.Sqlite` framewok, you have to use a `SqliteParameter` to be able to interact with a `Guid` stored as a `blob`:

```
var insertRowScript =
$@""INSERT INTO [ServiceTickets] ([ServiceTicketID], [Title], [Description], [StatusValue], [EscalationLevel], [Opened], [Closed], [CustomerID]) 
    VALUES (@id, 'Insert One Row in Sqlite client', 'Description Insert One Row', 1, 0, datetime('now'), NULL, 1)"";

int nbRowsInserted = 0;

using (var sqlConnection = new SqliteConnection(fixture.ClientSqliteConnectionString))
{
    using (var sqlCmd = new SqliteCommand(insertRowScript, sqlConnection))
    {
        sqlCmd.Parameters.AddWithValue(""@id"", newId);

        sqlConnection.Open();
        nbRowsInserted = sqlCmd.ExecuteNonQuery();
        sqlConnection.Close();
    }

```

If you want to make a SQLite Select statement on any table with a blob data type containing a guid, you could make a call like that.  


```
select quote(sync_scope_id), sync_scope_name from scope_info
```

### Using a PRAGMA directive

If you want to use a `PRAGMA` directive, you can't use a connection string parameter anymore. But hopefully you can send a PRAGMA request, once your connection is opened: 

```
SqliteConnection c = new SqliteConnection($""Data Source=fabrikam"");
c.StateChange += (_, e) =>
{
    if (e.CurrentState == ConnectionState.Open)
    {
        var cmd = c.CreateCommand();
        cmd.CommandText = ""PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL;"";
        var i = cmd.ExecuteScalar();
    }
};
```

I think there is a small issue when synchronizing via the webserver.  I have added the tables to sync in the webserver, and have modified the SyncServer project to connect to the webserver.
While the included database syncs fine when using direct sync, it produces the following error via webserver: System.String cannot be converted to System.Byte.
Please restore the database, adjust connectionstrings and run webserver+syncServer.

the idea is to create a **CLI** (Command Line Interface) to be able to sync through a command line.
**Please post a comment to discuss what you think** :)

# CLI
The cli will be added as a package to the `dotnet` command.  
The command line **exe** will be called (by convention) :  `dotnet-sync.exe` to respect the naming convention from the `dotnet` runtime.  
Once installed, the command line will be then called like this : `dotnet sync [command] [--arguments]`  

## How it works
The CLI will create what we can call a **CLI Project**.
The **CLI Project** represents a sync processus beetween a server and a client.  
No sync process can be launched if no **CLI Project** is loaded (Actually, a default project is allways created when launching the CLI).  
Here is the most straightforward sample to launch a Sync process:
```
$ dotnet sync provider -p SqlSyncProvider -c ""Data Source=(localdb)...."" -s Server
Server provider of type SqlSyncProvider added.

$ dotnet sync provider -p SqliteSyncProvider -cs ""adWorks.db"" -s Client
Client provider of type SqliteSyncProvider added.

$ dotnet sync table --add ProductCategory, Product
Table ProductCategory added.

$ dotnet sync -s
Sync Start
Begin Session.

        59a439cf-73e5-4cfb-8e19-092560554495 synced at 06/11/2017 10:46:37.
End Session.

```

Using a YAML file can be easier (see YAML section bellow)

```
$ dotnet sync yaml -f ""projectsync.yml""
Loading yaml file
Project ""projectsync01"" loaded

$ dotnet sync -s
Sync Start
Begin Session.

End Session.
```

After a first sync, your last project is allways loaded when you launch the CLI.  
You can so directly launch the next sync process :  
```
$ dotnet sync -s
Sync Start
Begin Session.
Ensure Scopes
Ensure Configuration
Configuration readed. 2 table(s) involved.

End Session.
```


## CLI Project

The CLI will create a **CLI Project** stored in a datastore. Actually, a SQLite database is used to store CLI projects.
A CLI Project is mandatory to be able to launch a synchronization beetween two databases. When launching the CLI, a default project is loaded (called `__sync_default_project`).
A **CLI Project** can be represented by a yaml file to describe itself (see section on YAML bellow).  

A **CLI Project** is defined by :
* A project name.
* Two providers : One server and One client.
* At least one table defined by its name, schema (optional and only used on SQL Server) and direction (optional, default is `bidirectional`)
* A configuration defined with several key-value (as shown in the yaml sample below).

## Creating the CLI

**TODO** : How to install the CLI ? 

References :
* Adding the cli to `dotnet` command : [abusing dotnet core cli](https://surfingthecode.com/2017/02/abusing-dotnet-core-cli/)  
* `dotnet` extensibility model [https://docs.microsoft.com/fr-fr/dotnet/core/tools/extensibility]()
* Installing the `dotnet ef` CLI : [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/miscellaneous/cli/dotnet]() : Great, but require a `.csproj` file.

## CLI Commands

### Integration within dotnet command line

Since we are called from the `dotnet` command, and to be compliant with the `dotnet` command extensibility, each command will begin like this : 
```
$ dotnet sync [command] [--arguments]
```
Some useful requests don't need [command] and are called directly with their [arguments]

* `-v` or `--verion` : Get the current CLI & Dotmim.Sync version. 
* `-h` or `--help` : Get the help informations.
* `-s` or `--sync` : Launch the sync process on the actual loaded project. 
* `--verbose` : Enable verbose output.

### Create, Get, Delete CLI Project

All project commands are called prefixed with [command] `project`.  
The `project` command is the default command, you can ommit it .  
Every sync process is associated with a project. When you launch for the first time the CLI, a **default** project is created (called `__sync_default_project`).  


Arguments available within the `project` command :
* `-n` or `--new` : Creating a new project with a unique name.
* `-l` or `--load` : Load an existing project by its unique name.
* `-d` or `--delete` : Delete an existing project by its unique name.
* `-ls` or `--list` : List all projects created and saved within CLI.


Creating a **CLI project** called ""**syncproject01**"" : 
```
$ dotnet sync project -n ""syncproject01""

Creating new project ""syncproject01""
Project ""syncproject01"" loaded
```

Getting an existing **CLI Project** :
```
$ dotnet sync project -l ""syncproject01""

Project ""syncproject01"" loaded
```

Deleting an existing **CLI Project** :
```
$ dotnet sync project -d ""syncproject01""

Project ""syncproject01"" deleted
```


### Adding Sync providers

Once you have loaded your **CLI project**, you can add providers.
You must add one server and one client provider.
  
All providers commands are available through the [command] `provider` : 
```
$ dotnet sync provider [arguments]
```

Arguments available :
* `-p` or `--providerType` : Adding a provider type, like `SqlSyncProvider` or `SqliteSyncProvider` or `MySqlSyncProvider`.
* `-c` or `--connectionString` : Adding the provider connection string.
* `-s` or `--syncType` : Adding the provider sync type : could be `Server` or `Client`

Adding providers of type `SqlSyncProvider` as server side and `SqliteSyncProvider` as client side :  
```
$ dotnet sync provider -p SqlSyncProvider -c ""Data Source=(localdb)...."" -s Server;

Server provider of type SqlSyncProvider added to project syncproject01

$ dotnet sync provider -p SqliteSyncProvider -cs ""adWorks.db"" -s Client;

Client provider of type SqliteSyncProvider added to project syncproject01
 
```

Calling the the `dotnet sync provider` again will replace the current provider : 
```
$ dotnet sync provider -p MySqlSyncProvider -c ""...."" -s Server;

Server provider of type MySqlSyncProvider replaced in the project syncproject01
```

### Adding Sync tables

One you have loaded your **CLI Project**, you can add tables.
At least one table is mandatory to be able to launch the sync processus
All tables commands are available through the [command] `table` :
```
$ dotnet sync table [arguments]
```

Arguments availables:
* `-a` or `--add` : Adding a table identified with its name.
* `-s` or `--schema` : Set the schema name for the current table. Only used with the `SqlSyncProvider`.
* `-r` or `--remove` : Remove the specfied table from the sync process.
* `-d` or `--direction` : Set the sync direction for the current table. Could be `Bidirectional`, `UploadOnly` or `DownloadOnly`

Adding tables to the current project :  
```
$ dotnet sync table --add ProductCategory
Table ProductCategory added to the project syncproject01

$ dotnet sync table -a Product -d downloadonly
Table Product [DownloadOnly] added to the project syncproject01

$ dotnet sync table -a Employee -d downloadonly -s Sales
Table Sales.Employee [DownloadOnly] added to the project syncproject01

```

### Adding configuration options

You can specify several options for your current **CLI Project** through the configuation command.  
All configuration options are available through the [command] `conf` :
```
$ dotnet sync conf [arguments]
```

Arguments availables:

* `-c` or `--conflict` : can be  `ServerWins` or `ClientWins`. Default is `ServerWins`.
* `-s` or `--batchSize` : set the batch size. Default is 1000.
* `-d` or `--batchDirectory` : Set the batch directory. Default is your environment temp folder.
* `-f` or `--format` : Set the serialization format. Can be `json` or `dm`. Default is `json`
* `-o` or `--bulkOperations` : Set if you want to use bulk operations when using the `SqlSyncProvider` is used. Default is `true`.

Adding configuration to the current loaded **CLI Project**:
```
$ dotnet sync conf -c ClientWins -f dm -o true
```

# YAML Format

Working with a yml file could be easier.
All YAML options are available through the [command] `yaml` :
```
$ dotnet sync yaml [arguments]
```

Arguments availables:

* `-f` or `--file`: Set the file name to load. if not set, the default directory is used.
* `-d` or `--directory` : Set the directory where the YAML file is stored.

Loaded a **CLI Project** stored in a YAML file :
```
$ dotnet sync yaml -f ""projectsync.yml""
```

## YAML File sample

Example of what we can have in such way :  
```
project: projectsync01

providers:
	- providerType:	SqlSyncProvider
	  connectionString : ""Data Source=(localdb)\MSSQLLocalDB; Initial Catalog=AdventureWorks;Integrated Security=true;""
	  syncType: Server	
	
	- providerType:	SqliteSyncProvider
	  connectionString : ""adWorks.db""
	  syncType: Client	
	
tables: 
	- name : ProductCategory
	  schema : dbo
	  syncDirection : bidirectional

	- name : Product
	  schema : dbo
	  syncDirection : bidirectional

configuration:
	- conflictResolution : ServerWins
	- downloadBatchSizeInKB : 1000
	- batchDirectory : ""C:\\tmp""
	- serializationFormat : json
	- useBulkOperations : true

```

I was wondering, how you are planning to solve the problem, that client and server schemas are not always quite the same.

For example: In our production system, we have a tasks table.
This table looks different on the server and client. I.e. server and client table share a set of columns, but both, server and client, add additional columns to their own tasks tables.

This also leads me to the following question:
Are you planning to solve the problem of the old sync framework which is, that those schemas must be equal and must not ever change?
(e.g. a schema update would be necessary)

You could:
1) add an (optional) middle layer between client and server that can process all rows and convert them from one schema to another. That way you could allow downward compatibility in case the server schema changes.

2) please have a look at this library, as I think it could save you a to of work: [DatabaseSchemaReader](https://github.com/martinjw/dbschemareader)


Not only allows it to inspect the schema of all databases you want to support, it even allows to create schema-migration sql and the like.

I have had a look at Dotmim.Sync, and compared its current capabilities with the stuff, that we currently have in production. (we are using [SyncWinRT](https://github.com/Mimetis/SyncWinRT) - I guess you know that library ;-))

What we definitively need is:

**1) a way to specify a filter on a table that is being synced.**  
Currently, when a filter is active, the Microsoft Syncframework regards all filtered records as ""out of the sync scope"". However, when the rows change in a way that should re-include them to that sync scope, the old Syncframework was not able to detect this.
We made that possible by updating the ""_tracking"" tables manually, using our server side logic.

**1b) we even need to be able to filter based on a table join!**
We currently achieve that by modifying the sql scripts (stored procedures) which are generated by the framework, so that they add a join expression. The complexity in that approac is, that the join filter also needs to take into account, that the joined table might have changes as well. (so while the current row should have not been synced to the client, it now should based on some changes in the joined table)
The only part where it got too complicated was with many-to-many joins. (I might be able to assist you with that feature ;-))

**2) Another part that was kinda cumbersome is, that SyncWinRT identified the sync master by its fully qualified domain name.**
That was a problem when users hat to use a different URL when they were in their corporate network. 
A quite easy fix would be, that the master database generates some guid, which is in turn used to identify it. In that case, the URL does not matter anymore.

**3) allow to change serialization format**
I have been playing around with protobuf-net recently and I am amazed by its performance. 
As it normally uses reflection just as any other formatter, it also allows you compile a dll with a ""hard-coded"" serializer. Dude that one is sooooo fast!!!
So I would really like to use that insead of json or the like. (Again: I could help you with that)

**4) Support one-way sync.**
That one is interesting, because we are thinking about syncinc an Event Stream (neventstore) from server to client, thereby applying some filters (as in (1) and (1b))
However, as the event stream **must** only be edited on the server, there is no need for two-way syncing.
So a one-way sync option for a specific table would be great!

**5) Use dotmim.sync for a file syncing api**
A colleague of me created a github library, that allows you to split up your binary files into aprts, send them to a Web-API server, and fuse them back together.
That allows you to send large files over weak internet connections.
Now it would be great to have that combined with dotmim sync as a file sync framework:
That way, on the client side you know which files are already uploaded, and which are pending.
You can also send the list of files a client requires (using sync) and let him/her decide which files to actually download.
Sure, this is far beyond the scope of Dotmim.Sync, but I wanted to share this idea with you nevertheless, as you might have some interesting ideas for it too. ;-)

The last couple of days I have been trying to solve this problem, and I tried to use vstest.console with chutzpah test adapter, and report from this tool is cool, it containing all data what I need, but it not finding all tests, I think a reason of that is not using ""/engine Chrome"" argument, because it not available to using in vstest.console :( ",NA,FALSE,https://api.github.com/repos/mmanela/chutzpah,https://api.github.com/repos/mmanela/chutzpah/issues/792/labels{/name},https://api.github.com/repos/mmanela/chutzpah/issues/792/comments,https://api.github.com/repos/mmanela/chutzpah/issues/792/events,https://github.com/mmanela/chutzpah/issues/792,NA

Debugging from the Test Explorer with Server mode turned on almost always fails. It looks like the test harness is completing and the web server (setup by Chutzpah) is being closed BEFORE Visual Studio has time to get in and launch and connect to a browser.

Running debug from the Context Menu ""Run Chutzpah with Debugger"" works just fine in the exact same code base and configuration.

I'm guessing this is about how the lifecycle of the Web Server is controlled but I would naturally expect the two ways of debugging to work in the same way (and the following would appear to agree: https://github.com/mmanela/chutzpah/wiki/Debugging-Unit-Tests).

# Details
Basic steps in any VS solution where Server Mode is enabled (explicitly or implicitly through the use of Chrome of JsDom engines):

Repo: https://github.com/john-swallow-cenduit/ChutzpahDebugIssue

- Build the solution so that Chutzpah picks up the single test.
- Put a breakpoint in the test.
- Locate the test in test explorer. 
- Run Debug and wait.

Expected: Browser starts. Jasmine page is loaded. Breakpoint is hit.
Actual: Most of the time it will launch an IE window and throw up a ""Cannot reach this page"" error.

Full details of all versions used are in the readme.md of the repo but the Chutzpah versions in use:
- Chutzpah 4.4.10
- Chutzpah Context Menu 4.4.9
- Chutzpah Test Adapter for Visual Studio 2012 4.4.9

I have a .NET Core 3.0 MVC app and am trying to test some javascript compiled from typescript (MSBuild which compiles on save) - Jasmine nuget pacakage 2.6.4.

chutzpah.json (in the project root):  



     {
       ""Framework"": ""jasmine"",
       ""EnableTestFileBatching "": true,
       ""RootReferencePathMode "": ""SettingsFileDirectory"",

       },

         }
       ]
     }


Project structure:

    scripts/
    --compiled/
        -- site.js
    --tests/
       --app.spec.js
    app.ts
    ajax.ts


    
Using the context menu to 'Open in Browser' on the `app.spec.js` file passes tests.
Selecting 'Run JS Tests' however returns an 'Cannot find variable: 'Format'.

app.spec.js:


    /// <reference path=""../compiled/site.js"" />
    describe(""Format Tests"", function () {
        it(""Can format a variable in a message"", function () {

            expect(Format(message, [replacement])).toBe(result);
        });

        it(""Does not replace without placeholder"", function () {
            var message = ""Request failed:"";

            var result = ""Request failed:"";

            expect(Format(message, [replacement])).toBe(result);
        });
    });

    function Format(pattern, ...variables) {
        return pattern.replace(/{(\d+)}/g, (match, index) => {
            return typeof variables[index] !== undefined ? variables[index] : match;
        });
    }


Stack trace in VS output:

    ReferenceError: Can't find variable: Format in file:///C:/Users/test/source/repos/CCBCForms/src/CCBCForms/scripts/tests/app.spec.js (line 8)

I'm stuck as to why the `app.spec.js` file doesn't seem to be picking up that compiled file that is referenced both using the `<reference path>` and the `References` section within the chutzpah config file.

Can anyone shed any light?

**Environment:** VS 2019 update 2 preview bits.

**Repro Steps:**
1. Create a new .Net Core Console application.
2. Add a .js file to the project.
3. Update its content to be the below:
```
function isEven(val) { 
    return val % 2 === 0; 
} 
  
test('TestMethodPass', function () {    
    ok(isEven(2), 'Two is an even number');

}) 
  
test('TestMethodFail', function () {    
    ok(isEven(3));         
}) 
```
4. Open Test Explorer.

**Expected:**
2 tests are discovered.

**Observed:**
The test explorer does discover 2 tests but it endlessly performs discovery operations on the js file.

**Note:**
This is tied to the project being updated because of the temporary html file created during Chutzpah test discovery. This triggers a container changed event as part of every discovery which in turn triggers another discovery.

The entire time we have been writing Typescript code and testing wth jasmine.

Chutzpah happily worked when we defined everything in namespaces instead of modules and it survived when we moved to requireJS and started created real modules and importing modules. Then it survived our switch from requireJS to webpack. Chutzpah happily continued using requireJS and it now used the JS files that were created each time we saved the TS file to disk, where webpack would do its own compilation and keep it's version in memory (or some other cache). 

But Chutzpah isn't fairing so well with the next move. I need to start using dynamic import statements. TS and webpack happily work together to build bundles that can be loaded dynamically at run time. But that means that I had to switch TS options from module: amd to module: esnext. 

The end result is that the TS files that are saved to disk no longer have the required ""define"" call that makes them compatible with RequireJS. So no code is imported and no tests are found. 

I am wondering if anybody has run into this situation and figured out a work around. 

I am considering having Chutzpah be responsible for compiling the TS code. This entire time, I have had Chutzpah setup to assume there is some external entity that is compiling the code. 

I am also going to look to see if there is an option in webpack for overriding the options in the ts options file. I didn't think about that until I started writing up this issue. That might be the best way to go. But if anybody has come up with a solution already, that would be great.

(I can't find any indication that the ""2012"" from Help>About is accurate.)

When I run my tests with Debug in the Text Explorer, my browser is opened, it navigates to a test page, and my code runs as expected. When I use Run, slightly different code executes. I'm having difficulty identifying exactly what the difference is because it's Release mode, but I'm producing an error which gives a stacktrace, below (absolute paths made relative for privacy). 

I've determined from tracing the code manually that the second entry in the stacktrace, at line 429, is in a function (init) which is invoked with a string argument ""q2config.json"". In Debug mode no argument is passed, and this significantly changes how the code executes. I haven't found that string as a value anywhere in my code, and have no idea why Chutzpah would be interested in passing it in. Nonetheless, it is being passed in and I can only guess that Chutzpah is somehow responsible for the difference in execution.

(Also, notice the jquery-3.2.1 reference. That is my latest jQuery but I never actually use it. If I delete that file, Chutzpah moves on to the next-latest version, further indicating that Chutzpah is responsible for all the code beyond that last jQuery reference, which is a call to a function ""complete"" in an anonymous function returned from a function ""callback"".)

What's going on here? Could I be pointed to the code responsible for launching a Run session? I'd like to make Debug and Run behave the same, even if by a workaround.

I digged deeper and found that the issues happen when ChutzpahJasmineReporter gets registered after initializeJasmine is called.

chutzpah.autoStart is always true so the test harness file automatically calls initializeJasmine after importing the test file. Since the evaluation of onFrameworkLoaded in chutzpahRunner.js is async, there's no guarantee that it is run before initializeJasmine is called.

Hope you're doing well. Was wondering if you'd be able to please help me out with the following? -

I'm trying to setup chutzpah + jasmine unit test for a sample project but unlike the online tutorials, my unit tests are not being picked up by Visual Studio's test explorer. Have detailed more about it below.

### What I have set up
* I've installed both Visual Studio extensions [[1]](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vs-publisher-2795.ChutzpahTestRunnerContextMenuExtension), [[2]](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vs-publisher-2795.ChutzpahTestAdapterfortheTestExplorer).
* I have a `chutzpah.json` file in the root of my solution (repo link attached at the bottom).
* I have installed the chutzpah nuget package (tried the latest and also tried 4.1.0 as per reference link attached at the bottom).
* Working on Visual Studio Community 2017 (I've also tried the same on VS professional 2017).
* Out-of-the-box MVC web app and I'm only trying to test a JS 'helper' file. 

### What doesn't work
* Visual Studio Test Explorer doesn't detect the unit tests.
* When I right-click a file and click 'Run JS tests', it gives me the following in the output window.
```
------ Test started: File: C:\Users\<username>\Documents\GitHub\jasmine-chutzpah-jsunittest-demo\Calculator.Web\Scripts\tests\app\appHelper.test.js ------
0 passed, 0 failed, 0 total (chutzpah).
========== Total Tests: 0 passed, 0 failed, 0 total ==========
```
* When I go to the packages folder -> chutzpah version folder -> tools and run `chutzpah.console.exe` in command prompt and give my web solution path OR `chutzpah.json` file as parameters, it gives me the same output as above.
* When I run `vstest.console.exe` and pass the `...test.js' file and the test adapter path (as mentioned in the reference link mentioned below), I get the following message:
```
No test is available in C:\Users\<username>\Documents\GitHub\jasmine-chutzpah-jsunittest-demo\Calculator.Web\Scripts\tests\app\appHelper.test.js. Make sure that test discoverer & executors are registered and platform & framework version settings are appropriate and try again.
```
* When I try an online build in VSTS, I get the similar message as above. It's able to find the appHelper.test.js file but then talks about test discoverer...etc.
  

### What works
* When I right-click a `...test.js` file and click 'open in browser', a Jasmine HTML test (SpecRunner HTML) page gets generated with all my tests passing/failing.

and my compile.bat:
`tsc -p tsconfig.test.json`

I tried to add references to react, react-dom, chai and mocha in the chutzpah.json, but it never got me anywhere further. Adding `/// <reference/>` tags at the top fails to compile my typescripts.

Also, when i run the npm command : `mocha -r ts-node/register test/**/*.js`, everything works. What am I missing in my configuration?

I've been working on setting up tests using Chutzpah, Mocha / Jasmine and Typescripts for a few hours, but it seems that I can't make it work.
I've had Chutzpah working fine with both qUnit and plain javascript, so I'm assuming it might be because of incorrect chutzpah.json configuration.

**Expected behaviour:**

Finding the tests and running them.


**Actual behaviour:**

Either something (module, function, class) being undefined during debugging or ""exports"" / ""require"" not being defined. I've imported both require.js and require.d.ts etc, config.js, config.d.ts and many, many more things hoping to solve the issues.
I've yet to find any examples or tutorials online trying to integrate these three frameworks together except on the github repo, where I can't find a specific chutzpah.json file. 

**Current code:**

**1. Mocha example**

I started trying to get Chutzpah to interface with Visual Studio running jasmine-node tests on a node.js file.  I can get it to recognize the tests, but they fail.  The error is ""Can't find variable require"" or ""Can't find variable exports"" or other common Node commands..  I decided to remove Visual Studio and try from the command line so I set up a basic Jasmine-node test.  It ran under Jasmine, but Chutzpah does not run.  I'm probably missing something simple, but I've zipped my test and the trace log and attached it.  I also attached a screen shot of my attempt to run Chutzpah from the command line. Any hints would be greatly appreciated!

Thank you,
Tammy

It works great for JavaScript, and pretty well for TypeScript, but I've been unable to get TypeScript code coverage to work the way we want it to.  Specifically, I've been trying to set it up to show the coverage on the TypeScript files, instead of the generated JavaScript files.  I've even gotten it working for the spec files, but it seems pretty set on showing the JavaScript for the files under test:

I've tried every combination of settings I can think of for the chutzpah.json file, with the results so far either being the same, or things just not working.  I also enabled tracing, but didn't see much that looked applicable to my (admittedly inexperienced at reading Chutzpah traces) eyes: [chutzpah.log](https://github.com/mmanela/chutzpah/files/1811336/chutzpah.log) However, I may still have missed some way to get things working.

I spent some time to come up with something close to the smallest possible project to reproduce the issue in Visual Studio 2017:
[Chutzpah Test.zip](https://github.com/mmanela/chutzpah/files/1811251/Chutzpah.Test.zip)
It also opens and shows the issue in 2015 -- let me know if it's not working in your preferred version and I'll see what I can do.

I'm hoping for one of two outcomes:
1. If there are changes we can make to any of the following files in that project to get things working, I should be able to apply that to our actual code:
- chutzpah.json (seems the most likely)
- tsconfig.json
- Toolbox.ts
- ToolboxSpec.ts
Changes to other files in the project are less certain to be directly applicable, but I'm willing to try them out.  We can't realistically stop using AMD modules or Jasmine.
2. If this is actually a bug in Chutzpah or the extension, hopefully the smallish test case helps it get reproduced and fixed.

However, if I change Tests settings to use `Includes"": [ ""*Tests.ts"" ]` instead of a path to html file, I will get reports generated but all tests failed (I assume some references are required like in index.html file???)

            }
        );
    }
);
```

And I've got a ``Chutzpah.json`` that looks like:

```JavaScript
{
    ""Framework"": ""mocha"",
    ""MochaInterface"": ""bdd"",
    ""References"": [
        { ""Path"": ""../node_modules/chai/chai.js"" }
    ]
}
```

Which all I want to also facilitate via ``gulp``:

```JavaScript
gulp.task(""test"",
    function() {
        return gulp.src(cfg.tests + ""/*.js"", { read: false })
            .pipe(mocha({
                clearRequireCache: true,
                ignoreLeaks: true,
                exit: true
            }))
            .on(""error"", console.error);
    }
);
```

I expect to see results reported to the test runner, but what I am receiving is a ``Jasmine`` browser window with *""No spec found""*, which leads me to believe that somehow ``Jasmine`` is my test runner in spite of having installed ``Chutzpah``? Never mind, connecting Mocha+Chai+Should-isms to the tests.

I've created a test project using Jasmine and Chutzpah and added  the **'Chutzpah Test Adapter for the Test Explorer'** and the **Chutzpah Test Runner Context Menu Extention'**  extentions, following this tutorial (https://developers.veinteractive.com/tech-blog/testing-javascript-chutzpah-vsts/). I've done it two times: one of then in a solution with only my JS tests project, and other in a solution with my web app other tests projects (Integration, Acceptance and Unit tests projects that are using NUnit, OpenQA.Selenium, FluentAssertions, etc).

In the first solution (the one that contains only the JS tests project), it worked really well. But, when I've added a JS test project following the same logic to my other solution, the Visual Studio's Test Explorer got really, really slow (it spend more than 15 minutes to find my tests - have in mind that, before I've used the extensions and created the JS tests project, it took, in worst case scenario, 2 minutes to find all my tests) to finally find all tests, including the JS ones.



Do you guys have any ideia of what might be happening?

I appreciate all the time and effort you have taken in writing this great tool however after a day of trying to get it to work I've had to give up due to lack of time. I'm running VS 2017 Professional with an Angular 4 project and have tried:

1) Your sample angular 2 application (does to work when loading into VS 2017!)
2) Various other demos and samples in GitHub and the web (most also don't work in VS 2017)
3) Even tried to take a sample that does work (https://github.com/GeorgDangl/NetCoreHeroes) and them slowly migrate config files over to my non-working solution but still cannot get it to work.

The main problem is the chutzpah configuration and its interaction with the various testing frameworks such as karma and jasmine. Its really difficult to work it all out and some more guidance on the interactions between the various configs is needed.

I already did some tests, just replacing the qunit files with the newest ones and everything seem to work without any problems, so it looks compatible (should be a straightforward replacement).",NA,FALSE,https://api.github.com/repos/mmanela/chutzpah,https://api.github.com/repos/mmanela/chutzpah/issues/656/labels{/name},https://api.github.com/repos/mmanela/chutzpah/issues/656/comments,https://api.github.com/repos/mmanela/chutzpah/issues/656/events,https://github.com/mmanela/chutzpah/issues/656,NA

It would be nice, when you could have a look at settings. The destination path (dist) and all subfolders have to be unchanged. I want the compiled js files in the folder ""/dist/source/*. In the folder core are the program files in tests sould be the test files.

Thanks in advance

I'm not 100% sure this is possible.

I'll explain my problem. We currently use QUnit to test our JS, we use individual test runners to do this, with a big ""MasterTestRunner"" which includes all of our test files and their dependencies.

Currently i'm trying:

`chutzpah.console.exe AlertsTestRunner.html /coverage /lcov cov`

This runs the tests and I get 5 total ran, but the cov file is empty. Now if I point it at the JsTest file, the tests run, but fail (due to it not know what modules are etc) BUT it does give me a populated lcov file. Not 100% sure if it's legit.

Currently our setup is we have a Powershell script that kicks off  node to run node-qunit-phantomjs against our MasterTestRunner. This works brilliantly, runs all the tests and gives us exit codes, but our last piece is to have a lcov file output, which we can then feed in to SonarQube to report on our JS Test coverage.

Basically I'm asking for a bit of help, is this possible? If so could you point me in the right direction please?

If I write the tests using TypeScript two things need to work in order for the tests to run.

1. The TypeScript compiler needs to be able to determine types for the  modules I'm testing -  I can work around this by creating declarations and referencing them in tsconfig.json
2. The  testing framework needs to be able to load the modules I'm testing - I can work around this with RequireJS

In order to do this with RequireJS, I need to tweak the configuration. Currently there's no easy way to do that with Chutzpah. I have to create a custom test harness and add the RequireJS reference in there with an appropriate data-main value.

Can we add some of this stuff on the chutzpah.json config file? Either the RequireJs config as an object or maybe a reference to a js file containing the config? Or maybe a value that can be either an object or a string?

Also, on a related note: it would be nice to be able to configure modules to be loaded before the tests. I'm thinking of polyfills and the like.

I hope you are happy to hear from me again (although all I do is open annoying bugs for you :-)).
I'm in the final stages of my migration from AngularJS to Angular.
I hope I would be able to convert my tests code easily.
In any case I was wondering if you were able to create a small test project to show how one can use chutzpah with Angular?
Previous version of angular was not using any compiling tools and so it was easier to understand how Chutzpah should be configured.
This is no longer the case I think (although I might be wrong).
would appreciate your input.
Here are a couple of articles on VS and angular-cli:
https://medium.com/@levifuller/building-an-angular-application-with-asp-net-core-in-visual-studio-2017-visualized-f4b163830eaa
http://candordeveloper.com/2017/04/12/how-to-use-angular-cli-with-visual-studio-2017/
As always and in contradiction to how the default angular tree looks like I would like the tests and the code to be in separate folders and projects.
I'm slowly building my `Angular4` branch to accommodate for all the changes - currently the compilation of the tests fail which is OK since I haven't got to them yet.

They work just fine locally, I can run **Jasmine**, I can do **Code Coverage** and see the integration with Visual Studio 2015.

Now, I setup my Build Server as explained in the Documentation by following these steps:

1. Configured for the Build Controller a BIN folder using the content of this package: **Chutzpah.4.3.4**
2. Created a Test Settings file which contains the specified XML (see pic)
3. Include the .js and .json file marked as ""Content Copy Always""

If I open the **""BIN""** result from TFS and Run Chutzpah via Console or using Visual Studio 2015 (of Build Controller) I can execute the tests.

But if I run the build I get this error, where no tests or test runner compatible were found:

```
Run VS Test Runner00:00:55
Inputs
TestSpecs: BuildParameter[] Array
Enabled: True
ConfigurationsToTest: String[] Array
OutDir:
Test Run Completed. 0 tests executed.
```

So TFS finds the projects specified by my pattern `**\*unittests*.js` but it doesn't understand that they need to be run using Chutzpah.
I am sure 100% sure I am missing something in the configuration of the Build Controller. Maybe I am using wrong version of Chutzpah, I need to install some else?

Under the JSTests folder are our spec files in subfolders, AND we have some test helper files under there too.  There are two subfolders mocks and ngTestDoubles.  The mocks folder just contains simple classes with static methods (thus, they're never utiilzed by Angular dependency injection), while the ngTestDoubles has some ""replacement"" constant and value classes (that are usually dynamically loaded at runtime).  So we wind up seeing code coverage of these ngTestDoubles files, which I want to exclude from the report.

First I thought it might be a general issue that it looks for the chutzpah_boot.js within the working directory. But the problem seems to be caused by the `TestFiles` folder. For my own test files i have a `TestFiles` directory in my test project. It seems that this misleads chutzpah to think it needs to look for the chutzpah_boot.js in the working directory. I found the cause in the code:  https://github.com/mmanela/chutzpah/blob/3a54a62f6218fd5e789781c4ad57693d6e657027/Chutzpah/FileProbe.cs#L223 

I think the exe path should overrule the working directory by default. Or at least the `BuiltInDependencyDirectory` should not only look for the `TestFiles` folder, but also for some chutzpah specific file. `TestFiles` is quite a general name that might exist in your test project. 

So a simple alternative could also be to rename `TestFiles` to `ChutzpahTestFiles` or `TestRuntime` to remove this ambiguous naming.

It took well under a minute. But in the generated Trx (generated using the trx transform), I see the following times:

```xml

```

which is over 23 minutes.

I ran it again (without the parallelism flag, if that matters), and it ran in 5.45 seconds, and the time in the trx file was even greater:

```xml
<Times creation=""2017-01-20T09:43:22.8065804-05:00"" queuing=""2017-01-20T09:43:22.8065804-05:00"" start=""2017-01-20T09:43:22.8065804-05:00"" finish=""2017-01-20T10:21:45.8220450-05:00"" />

I am running Chutzpah 4.3.3 and have Jasmine 2.5.2 installed. I wrote a bunch of unit tests in Jasmine months ago and was able to run them fine with Chutzpah then (including code coverage). I have not run these tests in a few months not but needed to update some of them so I tried running them again yesterday and nothing happens. When I use Chutzpah to run the tests (any of them) it just shows ""0 passed, 0 failed, 0 total"".

The important thing to note here is that nothing has really changed. We didn't update or change anything besides some code files in our project. It is possible that Chutzpah updated since the last time I ran them since it is set to automatically update. I did manually update Jasmine in case that was the issue but that doesn't appear to have helped.

I have a small **question** though.*

I'm running the latest Chutzpah release both in my Visual Studio 2015 and our integrated online build through VSTS (Visual Studio Team Services). The tests run correctly in both places, every single one of our tests pass, the outcome is identical and the test duration is comparable.

**Code coverage**

When running Chutzpah with code-coverage, *inside Visual Studio*, the HTML report opens showing the covered files, their code coverage results, as well as the average code coverage, which is **68%**, with **4499 total statements** detected. So far so good.

**Different results in VSTS build**

However, when the tests run *through VS Team Services*, I'm getting _entirely_ different reports. The code coverage reports **5 683/18 075 blocks** (~31%) and **3 459/13 535** lines (~26%). Now these are obviously wrong, as there aren't even as many lines in the covered files.

-----

My question is: does Chutzpah _not_ support integrated builds, or am I doing something wrong? On the VSTS integrated build, I have enabled the code-coverage setting.

This is the relevant part of my configuration:

```json
{
    ""CodeCoverageExecutionMode"": ""Always"",
    ""CodeCoverageIncludes"": [
        ""_references/*.js""
    ],
    ""CodeCoverageExcludes"": [
        ""**.tests.js"",
        ""**.tests.ts""
    ],
    ""EnableCodeCoverage"": true
}
```

And this is the command executed by the VSTS build (edited for clarity):

```
vstest.console.exe ""testfile.tests.js"" /Settings:""255.tmp"" /EnableCodeCoverage /logger:trx /TestAdapterPath:""packages""
```

So the command certainly goes through, but the coverage that comes back is almost certainly incorrect.",NA,FALSE,https://api.github.com/repos/mmanela/chutzpah,https://api.github.com/repos/mmanela/chutzpah/issues/585/labels{/name},https://api.github.com/repos/mmanela/chutzpah/issues/585/comments,https://api.github.com/repos/mmanela/chutzpah/issues/585/events,https://github.com/mmanela/chutzpah/issues/585,NA

I just finished moving my source over to use requireJS, so now I have to move my tests to use requireJS too. I got this working in a simple sample project first and I have Chutzpah performing brilliantly there. 

However, in my real project I quickly ran into a snag. How do I define the path to the third party  libraries that my code is ""requiring""? 

For instance, in my typescript code that requires moment.js, I would do this at the top of the file:

import moment = require('moment');

Then in a js file I configure requireJS to know where moment is located: 
```
requirejs.config({
    baseUrl: 'Scripts',
    paths: {
        ""jquery"": ""libs/jquery-3.1.1"",
        ""moment"": ""libs/moment"",
    },
});
```

I don't see anything in the documentation of where to put this type of configuration for Chutzpah. And if I define a JS file with this requirejs.config in it, then everything breaks. 

Right now I am working around it by using the References section of the Chutzpah.json file:

```
  ""References"": [
    {
      ""Path"": ""../squashspider/scripts/jquery-1.10.2.js"",
      ""IsTestFrameworkFile"": true
    },
```

But that is not ideal because this kills my ability to ensure that I am requiring the right package dependencies in my code. 

Is there a way to inject these requireJS path definitions?

Thanks

summary: had to move my TS unit tests into my main script directory and main project. Now the test explorer is empty


I have been using Chutzpah for a while with my project successfully. However, the project is getting to a size where I want to move away from using TS's reference directives to using requireJS to load modules. With my successfully running project, I have two projects in my solution: the main product and a TS unit test project. Chutzpah correctly fills in the Test Explorer window with the 500+ unit tests we have and life is good. I just got these unit tests running on our CI server on Visual Studio Online. 

Now that I am moving to using requireJS and proper modules, I decided to create a test project where I am trying to get everything working first. The first stumbling block was that I couldn't get the TS compiler to find modules defined in the main project from the unit test project. This turns out to be a known limitation of VS. There are a couple solutions out there, but i couldn't get them to work. So I started looking at your samples in Chutzpah and decided that I would bite the bullet and move my unit tests into the main project. I know have a Scripts directory structure that looks like this: (BTW, this is an ASP.Net MVC/WebApi app). 

```
Scripts
-> Chutzpah.json
-> config.ts     // require.js configuration-> Api  // the TS files for using the Api methods
-> App           // the TS files that make up the main application
-> libs          // the JS files I import
-> Typings       // .d.ts files
-> Tests         // The tests live under this directory
    --> Api      // test files for testing the Api TS files
    --> App      // test files for testing the App TS files
```

I have successfully setup the test app so that the TS files are properly loaded by the browser and execute properly. 

I have successfully setup Chutzpah such that I can right click a TS file in the Tests directory and select Run JS Tests and the tests will run. I get the output in the console that says how many tests were run. 
I can run any single TS test in the browser and it properly loads the required modules using require.js and the tests pass. 

Where things are falling down if I do a ctrl-r, a, then nothing runs. It does a build but no tests are found. And at no point have I seen any of the tests show up in the test explorer. My Chutzpah.json is as follows:

```
{
  ""Framework"": ""jasmine"",
  ""TestHarnessReferenceMode"": ""AMD"",
  ""TestHarnessLocationMode"": ""SettingsFileAdjacent"",
  ""EnableTestFileBatching"": true,
  ""AMDBaseUrl"": """",

  ""Compile"": {
    ""Mode"": ""External"",
    ""Extensions"": [ "".ts"" ],
    ""ExtensionsWithNoOutput"": [ "".d.ts"" ],
    ""UseSourceMaps"": true
  },
  ""References"": [
    {
      ""Path"": ""require.js"",
      ""IsTestFrameworkFile"": true
    },
    {
      ""Path"": ""config.js"", 
      ""IsTestFrameworkFile"": true
    }
  ],

    {

      ""Includes"": [ ""*/Tests/*.ts"" ],
      ""Excludes"": [ ""*/Tests/*.d.ts"" ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Is having Chutzpah run in the main project within the solution a problem? (in this simple test app this is the only project in the solution).

The headless browser Chutzpah uses is called PhantomJS. PhantomJS is based on the webkit rendering engine which is important to keep in mind since you are not guaranteed your tests will pass on a browser that uses a different rendering engine. However, in most cases your tests should work fine in across most the modern browser. **In the future Chutzpah will support more browsers that use different rendering engines.**

I'm trying to use Chutzpah to run some Typescript unit tests in VS2015, and I'm encountering several problems. The most severe is as follows:
![ct](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9450467/20302976/29670c7c-ab21-11e6-8d13-479d266f1480.png)
No tests appear in test explorer. There is a timeout error, but the test is trivial and should take no time at all to complete. If I run the test in an HTML page, it runs correctly. If I run the test from chutzpah.console, it runs correctly. I have installed Chutzpah both as a VS extension, and as a NuGet package within the project.

The log file for vstest.discoveryengine.x86 follows.

I built a custom VSTS build step based on Chutzpah. During our automated builds I wanted not only to run the Jasmine tests we had, but also establish the code coverage and fail a build if coverage drops below a threshold set by the team.

This was working for a few weeks. We are using the /coverage flag on the command line.

Now, even in VS on a dev machine using the Chutzpah plugins we see lots of timeouts. Increasing the time out to""TestFileTimeout"": 200000 in the chutzpah.json file does not improve this.

I checked out the git repo for Chutzpah to see if I could see what was going wrong.

I thought I tracked it down to blanket_jasmine_v2.js ~ line 5473

var timeout = _blanket.options(""timeout"") || 3000;

I tried overriding this and manually setting the timeout to 200000 also. 

var timeout = _blanket.options(""timeout"") || 3000;
timeout = 200000;

The error message being reported was being generated just beneath by

`throw new Error(""error (timeout="" + timeout + "") loading source script: "" + options.url);`

But the timeout was reported as 180, not 200000 or 3000. I might be getting my timeouts muddled up, so please bear with me.

If I turn coverage off, everything works again. It doesn't seem intermittent, every test run now has timeout issues. This used to work just fine on my project so I am not ruling out a problem in either our JS or our Jasmine tests. Line 42: Unexpected token (

I don't know which file it it referring to, so its hard to figure it out.

Any ideas?

great work with chutzpah by the way, love it... :-)

We have an issue where tests stop being discovered by the test explorer in VS2015 U3. with TFS source control.

To force discovery we have to cause an edit in a test file (a space will do) and save. Then it detects, however we have a lot of files...
I was thinking maybe a force scan option on the context menu or something... ?

anyways apart from this, it's working great.

I have a problem where, when I try to run a test, I get a ReferenceError: Can't find variable: KnockoutCourt. This is one of my typescript classes. 

I think I am missing some high level knowledge about how to set this up. So please indulge me as I try to describe my setup from the top. 

I am trying to test a ViewModel class for a page that uses knockout. The page loads data from a WebService written in C#. I am using an excellent tool called typewriter that will turn C# model/view model definitions into typescript files. I then include them on the page and I have easy access to the webservice. 

What this does, is it creates a number of files though. So my file structure looks like this: (and this is the order that I include them on my html page)

ApiCourtGroupsViewModel.ts
ApiCourtsViewModel.ts
CourtGroupsController.ts

of course I include the .js files in the html file. 

I then include:
messenger.js (for page level alerts)
CourtGroups.ts

It is CourtGroups.ts that is my typescript viewmodel that I want to test. 

My first question:
Do I have to include ""References"" to the first three files (ApiCourtGroupsViewModel.ts, ApiCourtsViewModel.ts and CourtGroupsController.ts) in my Chutzpah.json file? 

Do I need to have CourtGroups.ts included in the reference section of the Chutzpah.json file?

Oh, these files also reference Knockout since a bunch of the variables are knockout observables. So do I need to include knockout in the reference section of my Chutzpah.json file? 

Each time I add a new file like CourtGroups.ts, it is going to have an accompanying few .ts files in this similar structure. Am I going to have to add all of these to the Chutzpah.json file each time I want to test this new typescript viewmodel file? 

I think I need to see the answer to these questions before I proceed with asking my next question. Because right now I have all of these in my Chutzpah.json file and I am getting this ReferenceError when I try to run a simple unit test (jasmine). It says it cant find a variable that is a class defined in ApiCourtsViewModel.ts.

BTW, all of these files are embedded in a namespace of Api.Courtbooking. I was wondering if that is screwing it up. All this works fine on the applications page, I am just coming back to it to setup unit testing. 

Here is what my current Chutzpah.json file looks like:

```
{
  ""Compile"": {
    ""Mode"": ""External"",
    ""Extensions"": [ "".ts"" ],
    ""ExtensionsWithNoOutput"": [ "".d.ts"" ],

    { ""Path"": ""../Scripts/App/CourtBooking/CourtGroupsController.ts"" },
    {
      ""Path"": ""../Scripts/App/CourtBooking/CourtGroups.js""
    }
  ],

    {
      ""Includes"": [ ""*/Scripts/*.ts"" ],

    }
  ],
  ""CodeCoverageExecutionMode"": ""Always"",
  ""CodeCoverageIncludes"": [
    ""../Scripts/App/CourtGroups.*""
  ]
}


```

I am not sure if I got it right.

thanks

I'm doing things the Visual Studio way so I have a references.js that contains lots of `/// <reference path="""" />` statements pointing at my JavaScript resources, I haven't done any manual configuration for Chutzpah. 
When I attempt to inject my services in the ""beforeEach"" part of my describe test, I get a message like this:

`Error: [$injector:unpr] Unknown provider: apiRequestServiceProvider <- apiRequestService <- newChannelsApi <- newChannelsService`

The code looks a bit like this:

```

 var newChannelsService, newChannelsApi, $q, $rootScope, $filter;
        beforeEach(module(""myapp.channels""));
        beforeEach( inject(function (_newlChannelsService_, _newChannelsApi_,  _$q_, _$rootScope_, _$filter_) {

```

As I understand it, the ""newChannelsApi"" should be arriving as a mock, so there should be no need for the underlying dependency chain, but for some reason when I run the code from Chutzpah it is throwing the above message. 

I'm relatively new to testing in Angular so I could well be doing something weird but it looks to me as though the mocking process is somehow failing or something about the dependency tree here is causing Chutzpah to get confused. Unfortunately my app is pretty complex and I don't have time to put together a light reproduction case.

First off, Chutzpah is awesome. We used it in our Javascript app with TFS and everything worked wonderfully. Really impressive.

Unfortunately, I haven't been able to get it to work in our new Typescript project. We have a TypeScript app that uses jspm for package management and transpiles all the TS to systemjs. For what it's worth, I originally tried to get Chutzpah to work with systemjs and combed through [this issue](https://github.com/mmanela/chutzpah/issues/534) , but couldn't get that working quite right either, so I decided to add an extra gulp task and transpile all of our TypeScript into AMD modules that requirejs can use and got Chutzpah to work great with some tweaks to the chutzpah.json file when running from Visual Studio. This is our current chutzpah.json file:

```
{
  ""Framework"": ""jasmine"",
  ""TestHarnessReferenceMode"": ""AMD"",
  ""TestHarnessLocationMode"": ""SettingsFileAdjacent"",
  ""EnableTestFileBatching"": true,
  ""AMDBaseUrl"": ""Tests/"", 
  ""AMDAppDirectory"": ""App/"", 
  ""Compile"": {
    ""Mode"": ""External""
  },
  ""References"": [
    {
      ""Path"": ""tests/vendor/require.js"",
      ""IsTestFrameworkFile"": true
    },
    {
      ""Path"": ""tests/vendor/config.js""
    }
  ],
  ""Tests"": [
    {
      ""Path"": ""App/"",
      ""Includes"": [ ""*.spec.ts"" ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Now, I'm trying to get our gated check-in to run the Jasmine tests. I think I've poured over every blog post & thread here and haven't found a working solution. In Summary, here's what I have tried so far:
- Copied the latest Chutzpah.vsix contents to our build controller's custom assemblies directories
- Installed Chutzpah Nuget Package to the project
- Added custom Pre-Build task to the project that Transpiles all of the TS into AMD javascript into the AMDBaseUrl (Tests/) directory, then copies the entire App and Tests directories to the Output Directory used by the build
- Specified custom runSettings.xml file with: 
    TestingMode = All
   EnabledTracing = true
  This causes the build to at least acknowledge that the chutzpah.json file is present. But this is the only thing that gets logged to the %temp% log file:
  Chutzpah.json file found at D:\Builds\9386...\bin\chutzpah.json given starting directory D:\Builds\9386...\bin
- I logged into the build server's source directory where it copies all of the files to before building, and manually ran chutzpah.console.exe from the packages folder with the path to the chutzpah.json file, and it's able to run the all the tests without any issues. I noticed that none of the chutzpah Nuget dlls are copied to the bin folder where TFS compiles the project into. Should they? 

Any help would be so greatly appreciated. Thank you!

Not entirely sure if this falls under your project, given it seems to be a blanket.js issue but...

When code coverage includes a file for coverage featuring an arrow function then blanket_jasmine_v2.js throws an ""unexpected token"" error when parsing the "">"".

My particular stack trace begins:

`Error:Error: Line 46: Unexpected token >

Where line 46 happens to be a line in one of my application files using an arrow function. If I comment that line out, the line error changes to 50, where the second and last arrow function is. Commenting both out means the coverage runs. The two troublesome lines in my application are:

`Line 46: var productRoleId = vm.roleTypes.findIndex((el) => el.roleId === roleId);`
`Line 50: var index = vm.rolesToUpdate.findIndex((el) => el.Hash === userId + roleId);`

I'm currently working around this using the ""CodeCoverageExcludes"" option in chutzpah.json, but would like to know if there's anyway I'll be able to run coverage on code containing this syntax in the future.

I'm using the console runner to run my typescript tests.
The tests runs locally just fine from visual studio and I even get the nice html coverage report.
Now I want to publish this report to coveralls.io.
I know that coveralls doesn't support the format chutzpah writes but I found a way to convert the lcov file to what coveralls process.
unfortunately I can't get the lcov file to have any data in it when running from command line:
`chutzpah.console.exe .\chutzpah.json /converage /lcov .\chutzpah-results-lcov.xml`
am I doing something wrong?
Also tried junit, but got only tests report without coverage:
`chutzpah.console.exe .\chutzpah.json /converage /junit .\chutzpah-results-junit.xml`
Tried coveragejson flag which didn't create a file (I believe that when a user adds the /coveragejson flag it means he wants to get coverage report...)
`chutzpah.console.exe .\chutzpah.json /coveragejson .\chutzpah-results-junit.xml`
This is the only thing that created a report file, I'm still trying to figure out how to read it:

I'm having some trouble working with references in the chutzpah.json file. I have tests that work when I use the ""/// <reference..."" syntax, but would ideally like to use a glob pattern in the settings file.

My current understanding suggests that this should work...

``` json
{
  ""References"": [
    {
      ""Path"": ""../scripts/jasmine"",
      ""Includes"": [ ""*.js"" ]
    },

    {
      ""Path"": ""../../applicationdistributiontool2016.web/scripts"",
      ""Includes"": [ ""*.js"" ]
    },

    {
      ""Path"": ""../../applicationdistributiontool2016.web/scripts/pluggins"",
      ""Includes"": [ ""*.js"" ]
    },

    {
      ""Path"": ""../../applicationdistributiontool2016.web/app"",
      ""Includes"": [ ""*.js"" ]
    },

    {
      ""Path"": ""../../applicationdistributiontool2016.web/app/common"",
      ""Includes"": [ ""*.js"" ]
    }
  ]
}
```

...where the top three references are to framework JavaScript and the bottom two are app specific.

However, Jasmine seems to load without issue, but the .js files in the following two paths do not. I've run the command line executable with the above settings file and hit several errors such as, ""Error: ReferenceError: Can't find variable: angular""; I'm using Angular and it's source is in the .web/scripts folder.

My initial thought was just that I wasn't navigating to the folder properly. But if I put a specific reference to the angular.js file using the same path with no glob pattern, then the error for Angular disappears (I still have other errors that I think come from missing references)...

``` json
{
  ""References"": [
    {
      ""Path"": ""../scripts/jasmine"",
      ""Includes"": [ ""*.js"" ]
    },

    {
      ""Path"": ""../../applicationdistributiontool2016.web/scripts/angular.js""
    }

```

I feel like it's one of two issues, either I'm not navigating to the folder properly and Chutzpah is clever enough to find angular.js when given a filename, or I'm not using the glob pattern correctly.

Thanks for any help, I'm going to stick to the original ""/// <referenece..."" approach until I/we can solve this.
Chris.

I believe I have read everything but I must be missing something fundamental. I will start by saying I have an ASP.Net MVC Solution with three projects: 
- CommonResources - just an resx file
- App - the MVC project
- App.Tests - a unit test project that contains a bunch of c# unit tests. 

To prepare my project for js unit testing, I have done the following things:
- pm Install-Package Chutzpah
- installed the Extensions: Chutzpah Test Adaptor for the Test Explorer & Chutzpah Test Runner Context Menu Extension

BTW, it is unclear to me that I needed to run pm Install-Package Chutzpah. There really aren't any installation instructions. 

I have also installed via NuGet: 
- jasmine
- jasmine.TypeScript.DefinitelyTyped

my intention is to write Typescript, not javascript, but since I am stuck, I am starting with just javascript.

At this point, I can verify that I have chutzpah.console.exe on the filesystem. I have the context menu when I right click on solution explorer items. So it would seem to me that I have everything installed properly. 

I know that I don't have a SpecRunner.html file. Do I need one? I was under the impression that Chutzpah will create one for me. 

I will say that chutzpah seems to run but it doesn't find any tests to run. So ...

I have added a javascript file to the App/Scripts/App directory called CourtGroups.js. It contains: 

```
var CourtGroups = (function () {
    function CourtGroups(firstName, lastName) {
        this.firstName = firstName;
        this.lastName = lastName;
        this.firstName = firstName;
        this.lastName = lastName;
    }
    CourtGroups.prototype.FullName = function () {
        return this.firstName + "" "" + this.lastName;
    };
    return CourtGroups;
}());
//# sourceMappingURL=CourtGroups.js.map
```

I have the unit test file in the App.Tests/Scripts-Src directory. It contains: 

```
/// <reference path=""../../app/scripts/app/courtgroups.js"" />

describe(""Court Groups tests"", function () {
    var cg = new CourtGroups(""fred"", ""flintstone"");
    it(""returns full name"", function () {
        var fullName = cg.FullName();
        expect(fullName).toEqual(""fred flintstone"");
    });
});
//# sourceMappingURL=CourtGroupsTests.js.map

```

The source mapping is from the typescript compiler. These were originally TS files. 

When I right click on the CourtGroupTests.js file and select Run JS Tests, I get this for output:

> ========== Total Tests: 0 passed, 0 failed, 0 total ==========

Any suggestions of what I am doing wrong?

Thanks for the tool, it's great however I'm experiencing issues with tests with import statements on top of the tests. My .ts tests are getting compiled using commonjs. I'm setting up my project based on angular2 webpack starter kit and I'm not able to run any of the existing tests in that project using chutzpah. It can't discover them.

Below is the repo:

https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter.git

I'm using: 
- VS 2015 update 2. I use VS to build the project and compile the .ts files.
- Chutzpah 4.2.2
- No Resharper (I've seen other posts where Resharper was causing issues, so I'm trying to avoid it)

Here's the output window text:

------ Discover test started ------
Error: Timeout occurred when executing test file
While Running:c:\tfs\professional_services\tools\uitechstackseed\uitechstackseed\src\app\about\about.spec.ts

========== Discover test finished: 0 found (0:00:10.5995398) ==========
------ Discover test started ------
========== Discover test finished: 0 found (0:00:00.0149985) ==========

Can you please let me know if you're able to run any of the tests under the repo provided?

https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter.git

I've created a VS project (HTML with TypeScript template) so I can have a solution file and use VS.

I'm trying to keep my chutzpah.json file simple to narrow down the issue, here's what I currently have:

{
  ""Compile"": {""Mode"": ""External""},
  ""Tests"": [
    { ""Include"": ""_spec_"" },
    { ""Path"": ""./*.js"" }
  ]
}

I've added the chutzpah.json file under the ""about"" directory in the webpack project so I can just focus on one test (about.spec.ts) and get it to work.

Also here is my tsconfig

{
  ""compilerOptions"": {
    ""target"": ""es5"",
    ""module"": ""commonjs"",
    ""emitDecoratorMetadata"": true,

My team uses a standard gulp workflow to build files into an output directory (i.e. dist), and chutzpah.json to set references and test locations. However, our clean step frequently fails if a developer is using visual studio + chutzpah test adapter plugin, and running handle on our dist/ folder shows pretty much every referenced file as being open by visual studio. After disabling the Chutzpah plugin, this behavior dissipates.

Is there any way to prevent this aggressive locking behavior? 

Also, any recommendations you have for the traditional gulp/grunt flows would be helpful-- Running tests out of our output folder and cleaning the output folder every time we build is the standard practice.

I am using Chutzpah on my dev machine as well as during our TFS nightly builds. The builds were running fine, with code coverage as well, but at some point started showing the issue mentioned in [#340](https://github.com/mmanela/chutzpah/issues/340) and [#493](https://github.com/mmanela/chutzpah/issues/493).

I upgraded the Chutzpah files for the build server reference assemblies, as reccomended in one of those issues, to the latest version (4.2.1), and I think I also made some changes to the projects chutzpah.json files too.

TFS build now no longer runs js tests, and for each js file gives the following exception in TFS build log:
<code>
Error: System.NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object.
    at Chutzpah.TestHarness.BuildTags(IEnumerable`1 referencedFilePaths)

    at Chutzpah.TestRunner.c__DisplayClass15.b__14(TestContext testContext)
</code>

Providing a repo to replicate this may be difficult, since the tests run fine in VS 2015 and only appear on TFS tests. But I can run builds anytime manually and provide any of our config/code files to help resolve this issue.

I am trying to integrate Chutzpah runner to VS build for VS2013. My requirement is to run the tests on build, and fail the  build if any tests fail. For this I am using Chutzpah console application and creating a custom targets file for build.
The issue here is, when I provide the direct path of test file to the runner, the tests execute. But if try and add Tests to Chutzpah.json, no tests are detected.
I have added the repo here : https://github.com/anshul0258/POC.Jasmine
If possible, can you check once and suggest what am I missing here ?
If I give the path in targets file, then the tests are correctly running. But if I try to use json file, the test discovery fails.

I am using chutzpah for my typescript project, and recently added coverage.
I use requirejs, jasmine, external (Visual Studio) compilation, and ""UseSourceMaps"" option is set to true in my chutzpah.json file. I have been unable so far to get coverage for the source _.ts_ files, I get it only for the generated _.js_ files (ie the coverage html file mentions only _.js_ files).

I had a look at [this issue](https://github.com/mmanela/chutzpah/issues/308) and the associated (wonderful) PR, and it seems to me that me mapping between generated and source files is done only for ""referenced files"", which asynchronously loaded files are not. From my understanding, the mapping is reused to decide whether a coverage result for a javascript file should be remapped to the source file once coverage is done.

I created this small project for easier reproduction, this should make it easier for you to tell me if I missed something : 
https://github.com/dufrannea/ChutzpahTypescriptCoverage

I tested with [those changes](https://github.com/dufrannea/chutzpah/commit/f988e73f5978209dcda7c60c39b743c463c537c2) and I properly get coverage for my typescript source files. What my changes do is to  opportunistically find sources and source maps once coverage is done. The way to identify sources is clearly not how it should be done, but hopefully it illustrates my point.

Can you tell me if I am missing something here ? 

Cheers !

Chutzpah menu extension for VS version 4.2.1

Issue:
When running a test suite in the browser (IE11 and latest chrome), jasmine simply doesn't execute. And the problem seems to be this bit of code in the test.html:

```
`              // If we are not running in chutzpah then run the tests onload
             if (!window.chutzpah) {
                  var currentWindowOnload = window.onload;

                  window.onload = function() {
                        if (currentWindowOnload) {
                            currentWindowOnload();
                        }

                        jasmineEnv.execute();
                    };
                }`

```

Apparently, when run from VS2015, the generated test.html is  including the chutzpah_boot.js file which is defining window.chutzpah so jasmineEnv.execute never runs in the code bit above (at the end of test.html file).

If we set a debug point in Chrome and change window.chutzpah to false or undefine it, then all the tests run correctly when we click Continue.

At this point, we have to hack the template to adjust this logic so we can run tests in the browser.

Any suggestions as to what's wrong here?

I will say, I recently encountered an issue with NUnit where referencing properties on a dynamic object was fine locally, but threw a hissy-fit on Travis CI, and so I had to find a way around that (referencing a different pointer that was not a property on the dynamic object).

I have the latest version of the Chutzpah VSIX installed on my TFS 2015 server in VS 2015 Enterprise. Every time the server does a CI build I get this error. It was an internment issue until today when it became such a problem only 1 in 20 builds was passing. Yet all local test runs on developer machines always pass.

I did some digging and found that the error is caused by the fact that there is a default 180 ms timeout as per _blanket.options(""timeout"") when loading source files in the attachScript method ( line 5141 ) of the blanket_jasmine_v2.js file.
I hard coded this value to 10000 ms and my problem is solved, all TFS CI test runs are green again.

Can you please provide documentation on how to override this value in the chutzpah.json configuration? And adjust the default passed into blanket when enabling code coverage to a more sensible value like 3000 or 5000 ms. I imagine anyone with a large number of test on a busy server will be impacted by this problem.

Unfortunately, I have spent a long time trying to get Chutzpah to work for my project, and have failed! 

I am using VS2015
My project is a new Dnx based project, targeting dnx451.

I am assuming the reason I am struggling is because this sort of setup is either unsupported or not yet fully tested / documented yet.

Firstly, adding the Chutzpah NuGet package didn't appear to do anything for me. I added it to the project.json file, it seemingly installs,  but then I can't find anything in the packages directory, no chutzpah console exe etc.

So I moved on to using the test adaptor which to be honest is my preferred way of running tests anyway.

My existing project looks like this:
- Project A 
  - wwwroot
    - lib
      - (bower dependencies installed here)
    - modules
      - (compiled typescript output here as AMD modules)
    - require.config.js
  - typings
    - (tsd's installed here) 
  - Scripts
    - tsconfig.json (typescript project settings file)
    - typescriptOne.ts
    - typescriptTwo.ts

I like to keep my tests in a seperate project, so I created a new project to contain the tests for the above project, i.e:
- Project A 
- Project A.Tests

The tests projects adheres to the same structure as the first.

Try as I might, I couldn't get the test adaptor to work, and I am sure it must be something to with my Chutzpah settings file.

Each time it tried to discover my tests it hit problems which were shown in the output window. For example:

```
------ Discover test started ------
Error: Timeout occurred when executing test file
While Running:e:\src\projectA\wwwroot\test2.js

```

The problem for me is, the output isn't helpful to me in identifying whats wrong. I have been tweaking the Chutzpah file, and each time it would usually lead to a different exception in the output window. Sadly, because the test harness html file is deleted by the test adaptor each time, I can't easily see what impact my tweaks to the chutzpah config file is making to the test harness. I also can't open the test harness html file manually to try and see what the problem is and why thye test adaptor might be reporting an exception - because it only exists for a very short period of time on disk.

I've decided that for now, I can't afford to waste anymore time figuring out what is wrong, but if there are any brave souls out there that can demonstrate some sample, showing Chutzpah being used in a new Dnx project, AND testing typescript files that live in a seperate project, I'd find that really really helpful.

I have a typescript project with test. The code and tests worked as expected, Chutzpah did it's job flawlessly. 

But after I refactored it to use requirejs, there was problems. Running the code without tests works fine, but no tests will run. All fail with a ""Mismatched anonymous define"" from require. 

My chutzpah.json looks like this, I've tried a lot of different combinations, but without sucess.

I see that the samles for typescript + require uses a .bat to compile, is that necessary? It seems a hassle to have to keep the compile.bat updated everytime a test is added. I really like the transparent ease of testing the .ts' compiled by Visual Studio.

I have an issue when writing with TypeScript and using a base class - the base class file might get referenced after the derived which makes the derived class to not be initialized.
assuming I have a folder called `parsers` with typescript files I tried the following in the `chutzpah.json` file but it didn't work:

``` json
{ ""Path"": ""isrealhiking.web\\services\\parsers\\"", ""Includes"": [""Base1.ts"", ""Base2.ts""]},
{ ""Path"": ""isrealhiking.web\\services\\parsers\\"", ""Includes"": [""*.ts""]},

but they were still referenced alphabetically.
the following did work but the json file starts to look bad and the maintenance for this is high.

``` json
{ ""Path"": ""isrealhiking.web\\services\\parsers\\Base1.ts""}
{ ""Path"": ""isrealhiking.web\\services\\parsers\\Base2.ts""}
{ ""Path"": ""isrealhiking.web\\services\\parsers\\"", ""Includes"": [""*.ts""]},
```

Is there a better way to reference all the files I need in order to test my code?

I am using VS 2015 Update 1 on Windows 10 x64.

I can run my Javascript/Typescript Tests just fine via VS Test Explorer, Resharper Test Explorer or Context Menu -> ""Run JS Tests"" (using either QUint or Jasmine, tried both)

But when i try to debug them (via any of the before mentioned was), Internet Explorer opens (White Screen) and i always get the following error in the Output window:

> Error: System.Runtime.InteropServices.COMException (0x8971001E): Exception from HRESULT: 0x8971001E
>    at EnvDTE80.Process2.Attach2(Object Engines)

>    at Chutzpah.TestRunner.<>c__DisplayClass15.<ExecuteTestContexts>b__14(TestContext testContext)
> While Running:[...]\file1.ts

Sadly i this Error message isn't quiet helpful for me... but it states that the error happens somewhere Chutzpah related.

this happens on both - JavaScript and Typescript tests. What's tested doesn't matter, even a simple test like this can't be debugged:

```
QUnit.module(""QUnit Test - "");

test(""Can add"", () => {
    // Arrange
    var x = 0;
    // Act
    x++;

    // Assert
    equal(x, 1);
});
```

I hope you can help me, thanks in advance
Daniel

I have no Productivity Power Tools 2015 for Visual Studio 2015 installed, so it does not looks like a duplicate of #460

Strange thing is that happens only when I trying to run a _single_ test from TE by right click / Run Selected Test.  
Running all the tests (Run All), or just all the tests in a single file works OK.

Test file content:

```
test(""test1"", function () {
    expect(0);
});

test(""test2"", function () {
    expect(0);
});
```

It is fails only if there are at least two tests are declared in the same file.  
Running test1 turning in green (passed) in Test Explorer AND logs the error message in the output.  
Running test2 are not turning in greed (so it remains in ""not run"" group) in Test Explorer AND logs the error message in the output.  

Please let me know it I should attach any additional traces for this issue.

Full trace (test1, then test2):

The status-quo is to either hand-build your own test-runner HTML file to launch (in which case you're basically discarding half of what makes Chutzpah great; autodiscovering all your tests based on a glob match) or to exclusively rely on PhantomJS which had its web-security flags explicitly switched off to disable same-origin protections, etc.

Since VS 2015 tests that ran fine in the VS 2013 adapter are now throwing errors. They work fine on our build machine through TFS running Chutzpah so I assume it is just the adapter that has issues.

Some investigation indicates that a few scenarios cause the errors but they all give an Interop COM message:
<code>Error: System.AggregateException: One or more errors occurred. ---> System.Runtime.InteropServices.COMException: The specified test case was not found in the current result context (mapping test id to test node).</code>

This is the full output from the Tests window:

========== Run test finished: 0 run (0:00:03.8244173) ==========
```

This can be caused by running the tests from the Test Explorer.

Interestingly it appears a single test runs ok. This can be replicated in a new project with a simple test file (example.tests.js):

```
(function () {
    ""use strict"";

    describe(""Tests"", function () {

        it(""tests A"", function () {

            expect(false).toEqual(true);

        it(""tests B"", function () {

            expect(false).toEqual(true);
        });
    });
})();
```

However, some tests (at least `NUnit2XmlTransformerFacts.Will_generate_testsuite_for_each_file` and `JUnitXmlTransformerFacts.Will_generate_junit_xml` contain hardcoded numbers in the expected output with dot as separator, therefore they fail when the application is run with a culture which has a different setting ([of which there are quite a lot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_mark#Hindu.E2.80.93Arabic_numeral_system)).

I installed Chutzpah for Visual Studio and it worked fine for testing a module without any dependencies. 
But when I tried to run tests for a module that had a list of dependencies, my test crashed.
I tried injecting the dependencies in various ways.

At first, I did this:  

```
   beforeEach(module('app', ['ngRoute', 'ngSanitize', '7minWorkout', 'WorkoutBuilder', 'mediaPlayer', 'ui.bootstrap', 'LocalStorageModule', 'ngAnimate', 'ngMessages', 'ngResource']));    
```

Of course, I added references to all the files containing these modules.

Then, after searching a bit on the web, I tried to do this:

```
        module('ngRoute', []);
        module('ngSanitize', []);
        module('WorkoutBuilder', []);
        module('mediaPlayer', []);
        module('ui.bootstrap', []);
        module('LocalStorageModule', []);
        module('ngAnimate', []);
        module('ngMessages', []);
        module('ngResource', []);
        module('7minWorkout', []);
        module('app');
```

And even this :

```
        angular.mock.module('ngRoute', []);
        angular.mock.module('ngSanitize', []);
        angular.mock.module('WorkoutBuilder', []);
        angular.mock.module('mediaPlayer', []);
        angular.mock.module('ui.bootstrap', []);
        angular.mock.module('LocalStorageModule', []);
        angular.mock.module('ngAnimate', []);
        angular.mock.module('ngMessages', []);
        angular.mock.module('ngResource', []);
        angular.mock.module('7minWorkout', []);
```

Every time, the output when running the test was:

```
      Error: Error: [$injector:nomod] Module 'app' is not available! You either misspelled the module name or forgot to load it. If registering a module ensure that you specify the dependencies as the second argument.

Couple pointers :
1. This happens every 10-15 days or so after we fix it temporarily using one of the below solutions
2. I see that this error goes away when I somehow build a new version of chutzpah.dll after pulling the repo on my local.
3. It also goes away when the build controller is restarted.

Please let me know what you want me to do to reproduce it.
Also, I was not able to generate a log file. After I added a .runsettings file using this 
https://chutzpah.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=tfsbuild

```
<RunSettings>
 <ChutzpahAdapterSettings>
   <EnabledTracing>True</EnabledTracing>

and added it to the Build Controllers custom option/settings file, it properly errored out saying this :

I am having a hard time getting Chutzpah to work correctly in Visual Studio Enterprise 2015.

I have a suite of QUnit tests. I have the Test Adapter and Test Runner version 4.1.0 installed via nuget.

For some reason, the Test Explorers does not show all the tests (it show some of them) although I have explicitly mentioned the paths within the Chutzpah.json file.

Furthermore, when I run the tests using run all, not all the tests are executed, just some of them.
If I go an explicitly run the tests that have not been executed, they run no problem.

I have no trace in the Output console, so I am not sure where to look anymore.

When I run the tests using the chutzpah.console.exe, I get a bit of random execution of tests. Sometime they run, sometimes not depending on the js unit test file. 

I have changed the parallelism to 1 in the options, but that did nothing.

The Test Explorer _did_ show my tests, but that was merely because I had a `test.html` file that allows you to run all the tests without Visual Studio or Chutzpah. Some troubles with this include that double-clicking a test took me to that `test.html` file, not the test itself, and that I need to ""touch"" the `test.html` file before renames/deletions/additions to the set of tests are reflected in the Test Explorer.

So I removed the `test.html` file for testing purposes, but to my surprise all tests disappeared from the Test Explorer. There is no warning/indication of this in the Build or Test output, or any feedback from the Test Explorer on the reason my tests are missing. I searched with Google and Stack Overflow and didn't find anything either.

    QUnit.module(""Testmodule"");
    QUnit.test(""Can create default item"", function (assert) {
        assert.ok(!!new ConstructorFn());
    });
}());
```

In hindsight this kind-of makes sense, and if you know the internal workings of Chutzpah it probably makes a lot of sense.

If there's an easy fix, it would be fantastic if aliasing QUnit with an argument in the enclosing function is picked up by Chutpah.

If there's no easy fix or if it doesn't make sense for another reason to ignore this, that's fine: it's only a minor issue for me. Honestly, I mostly took the time spelling out this issue so others that make the same mistake can find this issue and see the workaround / solution here too.

Kind regards and thanks for creating / maintaining such a great piece of open source!

I've just set up Chutzpah on a TypeScript project, and I'm loving it so far!

One thing I have noticed, and was wondering if something could be added for it, is that the provided version of Jasmine (and presumably Mocha and QUnit) sometimes lags behind the version that bower will bring in. In our project we had a separate test runner HTML file, that we were initially using for tests, and obviously there we could bring in the latest versions of everything (so we might end up using things provided by the later versions).

I was thinking that maybe there could be a way to specify that certain references will override the built in testing libraries. When something like that is done, it's obviously down to the user to make sure they reference everything.

I guess I could try and fake it by making a custom harness file, or by replacing Jasmine in the extension installation, but something more official would be nicer.

Is this something I can already do, or is this something worth pursuing do you think?

I found this unofficial [XSD](https://github.com/tsimbalar/CodeCoverageParser/blob/master/CoverageXml/xsd/coverage.coveragexml.xsd) that might help.

I hope you will consider adding support for one of these to Chutzpah to make it easier to integrate with Jenkins and other tools.

I'm trying to do a unit test for my AngularJs app, using Chutzpah in VS2013.
Let's say I have this factory:

```
myAppModule.factory('MyService',function(){
  var fact = {};
  fact.myFunction = function(){
    return ""Hello"";
  };
});
```

I wrote the unit test for it like this:

```
describe(""TestService-Test"", function () {
   var service;

    beforeEach(function () {

    module('myApp');

    inject(function ($injector) {
        service = $injector.get('MyService');
    });
});
```

This works fine, but if I added to the same service just one dependency (or more):

```
myAppModule.factory('MyService',function($scope){ ... etc the same
```

Even if I didn't use $scope, this will throw an exception when run the test in VS2013 using Chutzpah, and the exception says:

`Result Message: Error: [$injector:unpr] ... etc`

As I understood from this error it's about not be able to identify the service I'm asking for.

I need to be able to inject some dependencies in the service creation, but how to do it ?

If I did the same with the controller It'll work like a charm because, it has a clear way to inject the dependencies while creating the controller using the service $controller.

**PS:**
At the top of test js file I'm including those references:

```
/// <reference path=""../js/angular.min.js"" />
/// <reference path=""../js/angular-mocks.js"" />
/// <reference path=""../js/myAppFile.js"" />

If you run the .Spec file in 2013 it works. If your run the .Spec file in 2015 it fails. In Chrome dev tools you can see it didn't download the reference listed in the .Spec file.

**Detailed Reproduction**
To do the steps manually:

(1) Create a VS2013 web project

(2) Add a scripts folder

(3) In the scripts folder add MyLibrary.js with the following contents

```
var myModule = window.myModule || {};
myModule.myLib = function () {
    return {
        saySomething: function () { return ""Hello World""; }
    }
}();
```

(4) In the scripts folder add Chutzpah.json with the following contents:

```
{
    ""RootReferencePathMode"": ""SettingsFileDirectory"",
    ""TestFileTimeout"": 120000,
    ""FrameworkVersion"": ""1"",
    ""References"": [
        { ""Path"": ""//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jasmine/1.3.1/jasmine.js"", ""IsTestFrameworkFile"": ""true"" },

    ],
    ""Tests"": [
        { ""Path"": ""Tests"", ""Include"": ""*.Spec.*"" }
    ]
}
```

(5) Create a ""Tests"" folder within the ""Scripts"" folder

(6) In the tests folder add MyLibrary.Spec.js with the following contents

```
/// <reference path=""../MyLibrary.js"" />

describe('ChutzpahTest', function () {
    it(""say something"", function () {
        expect(myModule.myLib.saySomething).toBeDefined(""Hello World"");

When I right-click on the project inside Visual Studio and select ""Run JS Tests"", the chutzpah.log indicates that Chutzpah is spending about 2 minutes just scanning the node_modules folder looking for settings files and trying to build a test context for every javascript file it finds.  Due to the filter in the settings file, it correctly discards them.

Given my settings file filters out any javascript files outside of js/tests, why is Chutzpah spending 2 minutes looking elsewhere?  The time to look in js/tests is only 10 seconds.  The total time for the test run is almost 4 minutes. Half the time needlessly scanning node_modules.

Ironically, when I run the same tests and folder structure under a TFS build with the Test Sources Spec set to `ProjectRoot\**\*Tests.js`, chutzpah never even looks outside js\tests for additional settings files or tries to build test contexts in node_modules.

Is there some configuration that I'm missing?  How can I tell Chutzpah not to scan the node_modules folder?

**Update:** I'm not very good at markup. I don't know how to draw a folder structure. Just to clarify, the items in my attempt with an underscore are to represent folders.  The underscore isn't actually part of the name.

If I capture the temporary html file the console app creates and the command line it uses to execute PhantomJS (sysinternal's process monitor and process explorer are _the best_) I can recreate this outside the your console application.

PhantomJS says this:

PhantomJS has crashed. Please read the crash reporting guide at https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/wiki/Crash-Reporting and file a bug report at https
://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/issues/new with the crash dump file attached: <path to a dump file>

Without symbols the dump was pretty useless.

I can, however, pinpoint the test the fails, but it's nearly identical to other similar tests in that file, so I can't see what I could be doing ""wrong"" enough to crash the browser. This test, the tests in that file, and the tests in other files all run file in Visual Studio using your tool. They also run fine in the Jasmine test runner page we also use. 

**While this isn't really a Chutzpah issue, but I have a few requests:**

**1. I'd like to see if PhantomJS 2.0 fixes this.** You're using 1.9. Dropping the new version into the install directory doesn't work. The first issue was chutzpahRunner.js doesn't work. See this:

http://phantomjs.org/api/phantom/property/args.html

I fixed that issue, but I still can get it to work. Now I see this:

**Have you investigated using PhantomJS 2.0?** Any suggestions on how to make this work to see if 2.0 fixes the problem?

**2. Logging the current  test executing after a crash**
It would have been nice if the the console application logged the currently running test when PhantomJS crashed. I can see this ""#_#TestStart#_#"" {...} right before it crashes so I would think this is possible.

I did the following:
1. add Chutzpah nuget tools (both).
2. Create a project of type class library
3. removed all references to C#.
4. added jasmine definitely typed from nuget.
4. added a single file called test.ts:

``` js

Thanks for this tool! It is awesome! However, something is not ok. I have checked the issues and nobody has reported something like this yet.

I'm using Visual Studio 2015 Enterprise with Chutzpah to test my javascript code. I get the error below continuously.

It does not matter whether the parallel is set up to 1 or 8. The error is the same.

As a consequence, obviously, the test explorer window does not list the tests described in that file.

I'm not using references in the spec files, they are in Chutzpah.json file.

Is there anything what is needed to figure out how to fix this?

Update: it works fine with references, but, the reason why I converted my project is that I don't want to copy-pasting the references...

Steps to reproduce:
- Use latest Chutzpah adapter plugin.
- Git Clone [kendo-pouchdb project](https://github.com/terikon/kendo-pouchdb).
- Run 'npm install' to install dependencies.
- Open /KendoPouchDB.sln file.
- Open test explorer.
- The test explorer will fail, with 'Error: One or more errors occurred.' in chutzpah.log.

Now to make Chutzpah work again:
- Close the solution.
- Go to node_modules folder.
- Remove all folders that contain 'grunt' in their names:
  - grunt
  - grunt-contrib-jasmine
  - grunt-contrib-jshint
  - grunt-contrib-uglify
  - grunt-kendo-lint
  - load-grunt-tasks
- Open the solution.
- Go to test explorer.
- Tests will appear!

Now developed in VS2013. The problem with VS.Common was something to do with the way I was copying DLLs directly into the TestWindow\Extensions folder, I think.

Another odd thing was that if I DON'T bump the version number but keep the current number (4.0.3), installing the newly built VSIX package results in the previous, originally-installed package being re-installed. Furthermore, when building with the original version number, it seems to want to re-install the newly built package, right there during the build process. Finally, if the VS process doesn't have admin rights that attempt eventually bombs out after a couple of minutes.

It seems that the build.bat should be run as `build package 4.0.4` or whatever version number is required, that then overwriting any current version numbers in the in the AssemblyInfo.cs files.

Anyhow, when built as 4.0.4 and vsix installed into 2013, doing a right-click on a Test item in the test window with a BP set in the script, IE gets launched and the script breaks at the BP in the IDE.

The one thing missing for me was script debugging from the Test Adapter. The goal was to set a breakpoint in a test script, right click the entry for the test in Test Explorer, select Debug Selected Test, then have the debugger load and break at that BP.

So I've had a go at getting that to work. It's quite a large PR so no worries if it doesn't get merged, but wanted to communicate how you might go about implementing that feature.

Essentially, I've taken a look at how Visual Studio debugs a script and worked out how to do that programatically when the test adapter is executed in IsBeingDebugged==true mode.

It seems that I can't include a template like :

If I change the extension to `.html` instead of `.cshtml` then it works correctly and the template is included. Am I doing something wrong or is this not supported ?

Thanks.

`This setting lets you describe in the Chutzpah.json file how to execute a command which can compile your source files to .js files. You tell Chutzpah what to execute and some information about what your executable does (like where to find the generated .js files). Then after running the executable Chutzpah can associate each source file with each output file to still give the nice behavior of mapping tests back to their original files.`

I interpret this to mean that the js.map files are utilized properly and therefore breakpoints in the original TS source should work.

Everything else is working properly.

When I place a breakpoint in a Typescript unit test, it fails to break when `Test->Debug->All Tests`.

It also fails to break when right clicking and selecting the Chutzpah menu item to `Open in Browser`.

I would like to run a very basic typescript test with Jasmine but I can't get it work.
I'm using Visual Studio 2013 and the chutzpah extension.

the file is typescript.spec.ts :

``` javascript
/// <reference path=""../scripts/typings/jasmine/jasmine.d.ts"" /> 
describe(""ts unit test"", function () {

    it(""should be true"", function () {
        expect(2).toBe(2); 
    }); 
});
```

This is what is reported in the Visual Studio Tests Output :

``` javascript
------ Discover test started ------

========== Discover test finished: 0 found (0:00:00,5343273) ==========
```

I currently have no more chutzpah.json since none of the settings I tried worked so far.

NB : All tests are discovered and work fine when I write them in a .js file directly but I really need to make them work with typescript files.

If you could help me find out what is the problem it would be appreciated (a lot).
I'm sure it's all about this compile setting but I didn't really understand how it works in my scenario (basic) when I read the doc.

EDIT : 
I have tried to compile/run your MsBuild TypeScript sample and it works. I can't make it work replacing qunit files/references with jasmine ones tho (0 test found)
If i press manually Run JS Test i get a 
Chutzpah Error: ChutzpahCompilationFailedException - 
 While Running:C:\Users\MASSELGU\documents\visual studio 2013\Projects\TypeScriptHTMLApp2\TypeScriptHTMLApp2\chutzpah.json

Could you provide a basic working example just like you did in the samples with Jasmine instead of QUnit? (and eventually the angular.d.ts which i noticed has the same problem as Jasmines one)

EDIT2 : YES !
I did it !
First I had an old typescript version in my PATH environment variable. I had 1.3 before 1.4 so I had to remove the 1.3 ref.
Then I took the chutzpah.config you gave in another topic :

```
{
  ""Compile"": {
    ""Mode"": ""External"",
    ""Extensions"": ["".ts""],
    ""ExtensionsWithNoOutput"": ["".d.ts""]
   },
  ""References"": [
    {""Include"": ""app.ts"", ""Exclude"": ""app.d.ts"" },
    {""Include"": ""*/src/*.ts"", ""Exclude"": ""*/src/*.d.ts"" }
  ],
  ""Tests"": [
    { ""Include"": ""*/test/*.ts"", ""Exclude"": ""*/test/*.d.ts"" }
  ]
}
```

And it worked !!!!!!!!!
I hope it can help people if they run into the same problem.

Other problem :
I get a reference error : can't find variable: module or angular even tho I include

```
/// <reference path=""../scripts/typings/angularjs/angular.d.ts"" />
/// <reference path=""../scripts/typings/angularjs/angular-mocks.d.ts"" />
```

It seems like the test can't find the associated .js files. Did I miss something in the process ?

Plus, is there a difference between the References field in chutzpah.json and the reference in a .ts file ? Do you need one of them ? Both ?

EDIT : I managed to make it work adding the .js (not .ts or .d.ts !) in my chutzpah.json. Is it the right way ?

```

This makes it difficult to ensure that all tests are loaded/run before QUnit starts if using inline requires, or generally, anything that adds a test after some asynchronous activity. I am using a wrapper to abstract dependency resolution in test files, and working around this has proved tricky in the past. The latest update of chutzpah/qunit made this harder (no longer allowed to call `QUnit.stop()` outside of a test). I am continuing to work around this by generating a test before any of the real tests are added that stops QUnit again, but this now causes tests to no longer appear in test explorer. 

It would be great if there was simply an option to have Chutzpah NOT automatically call `QUnit.start()` and just let the end user control it so I didn't have to keep finding hacks to achieve this goal. Alternatively, just respect the ""QUnit.config.autostart"" property -- if it's already false, then don't start QUnit automatically.

It looks like I could use this `_Chutzpah_covobj_name` global.. which does exactly what I want here.. but this doesn't seem very legit and likely to break in some future release.

What have I configured wrong?  I have jasmine 2.2 installed, which is what Chutzpah defaults to.

It may or may not be related - I assume it is - but when the solution first loads, it takes FOREVER (15+ minutes) for the test explorer to find tests.  And, when it's done, it lists no javascript tests (which makes sense, since it can't find them in any context).  I hope this is just a configuration issue that I can mend.

Only have few other extensions - web essentials and git tools along with a few template ones such as SideWaffle etc - so nothing that should impact testing.

Here is the extract from my %APPDATA%\Microsoft\VisualStudio\10.0\ActivityLog.xml after I uninstalled web essentials and vs restarted.

I have seen a strange thing while trying to run my jasmine test case with Chutzpah Testcase Adapter.

Please get the below detail.

I am using Typescript+RequireJS and jasmine for my test cases 
.
Refere the below image for solution structure.

![solution](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12337278/7536218/84faa404-f5ab-11e4-9067-f734c5282a47.PNG)

Below is chutzpah.json located at root folder

{
    ""TestHarnessReferenceMode"": ""AMD"",
    ""TestHarnessLocationMode"": ""SettingsFileAdjacent"",
    ""TypeScriptModuleKind"": ""AMD"",
    ""References"": [
        { ""Path"": ""defs/qunit.d.ts"", ""IncludeInTestHarness"": ""false"" },
        { ""Path"": ""defs/require.d.ts"", ""IncludeInTestHarness"": ""false"" },
        { ""Path"": ""lib/require.js"" }
    ],
    ""Tests"": [
        { ""Path"": ""tests/unit"", ""Includes"": [ ""_.js"" ], ""Exclude"": ""_.d.ts"" }

```
],
""Compile"": {
    ""Mode"": ""External"",
    ""Extensions"": [ "".ts"" ],
    ""ExtensionsWithNoOutput"": [ "".d.ts"" ],
    ""SourceDirectory"": ""js"",
    ""OutDirectory"": ""js""
}
```

}

below is test case file 

/// <reference path=""../../defs/jasmine.d.ts"" />
/// <reference path=""../../defs/require.d.ts"" />

import ClassA = require(""../../js/ClassA"");

describe(""Jasmine - test case"", () => {

```
it(""Jasmine - Class A object should be defined"", () => {
    expect(ClassA.ClassA.ClassAObject).toBeDefined();
})
```

});
# ClassA.ts

import ClassB = require('ClassB');

export class ClassA {

```
public static ClassAObject: string = ClassB.ClassB.obj;
```

}
# ClassB.ts

export class ClassB {

```
public static obj:string = ""object assigned"";
```

}

You may notice that I have refered ClassA via require which internally uses ClassB via requireJS.

But when I try to run or discover test cases it does not it as mentioned in test case file.
I saw the chutzpah.log and saw that Chutzpah find ClassB.js file at the right location below

/<Project>/js/ClassB.js

But it also again try to find same file at wrong location (on the root location) as below

/<Project>

I guess it can be the issue because I am having an timeout error while see in output window.
And, When I Put ClassB.ts file at root location It works fine.

};
```

I can't see any error between the folder structure and the `chutzpah.json`config file. Perhaps I'm wrong. I'm also frustrated because running the `QUnit` tests in the browser, with same configuration files and tests, are being executed successfully. I know that this issue is a lot different from the browser runner, but I hope to be able to run it.

I've even installed the 'Test explorer' plugin for `chutzpah` and my tests are not being displayed on it. On the other hand, I've executed a little test with `chutzpah` samples with `RequireJS`, and they are working fine, and its tests cases are displayed on the 'Test explorer'

Obviously, I need to use `dojo` because I use it for my classes' structure so...I need it. Actually my final goal is to use `QUnit` with `Sinon.JS`, but I hope that when I solve the issue with `dojo` 
I won't have more problems (it is not a realistic dream, I know).

Basically, this issue is almost the same text as the [`stackoverflow` post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28905394/is-chutzpah-compatible-with-dojo-require-and-sinon) where I explained my problem too. 

If you need some other information or you want know anything else about the issue don't hesitate to ask me. I could even provide you a project to test it if I knew how to upload it.

Here is my chutzpah config:

and here is the execution piece in team city:

%teamcity.build.checkoutDir%\packages\Chutzpah.3.3.1\tools\chutzpah.console.exe

""%teamcity.build.checkoutDir%\Roydan.Web\chutzpah.json"" /coverage /teamcity

Any Ideas as to what would be causing this?  The results are never consistent.  The file that cannot be found will be different each time the build runs.  However, there is always at least one file that cannot be found.

You can reproduce the error by using a protected method in the main file being tested.  The error occurs from that point forward.

Question:  1.  Is this a bug, or am I missing something?  Here is my json file extract:
""Framework"": ""jasmine"",

```
    ""TestHarnessLocationMode"": ""SettingsFileAdjacent"",
    ""TypeScriptCodeGenTarget"": ""ES5"",
    ""RootReferencePathMode"": ""SettingsFileDirectory"",
    ""References"": [ {""Path"": ""../Functions/Ts"", ""Include"": ""*T.ts""}]
```

As you probably notice from the above the my testing takes place in a separate project (not that this will make any difference).  The test project has also been setup for ECMA5, which should allow protected functions?

Question 2:  Is there a workaround.  I have tried [without success yet] to setup a compile option to use msbuild and to use the bat file option.  This also gave Chutzpah Error: ChutzpahCompilationFailedException - while running c:...... json.  My json for that is as follows:

```
{
    ""Compile"": {
        ""Extensions"": [ "".ts"" ],
        ""ExtensionsWithNoOutput"": [ "".d.ts"" ],
        ""Executable"": ""%msbuildexe%"",
        ""Arguments"": ""/t:CompileTS "",
        ""OutDirectory"": ""out""
    },
    ""References"": [
        { ""Path"": ""../Functions/Ts"", ""Include"": ""*T.ts"" }
    ],
    ""Tests"": [ 
        {""Include"": ""*/Tests/*test.ts""}
    ]
}
```

with compile file being: 

```
       <?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8""?>
        <Project ToolsVersion=""12.0"" DefaultTargets=""Build"" xmlns=""http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003"">
          <PropertyGroup>
                 <TscExe>tsc</TscExe>
          </PropertyGroup>
          <Target Name=""CompileTS"">
                 <Exec Command=""$(TscExe) ../Functions/Ts/T.ts Tests/test.ts --declaration --sourcemap --outdir out"" />
          </Target>
        </Project>
```

If I use the above compile option the out folder remain empty.  However somehow I got the files to compile using the .bat file, but the same error message appeared.  What else can I try, or what am I missing?

For completion here is the Typescript file being tested (T.ts) [ps this is just to repro the error]

```
module PT {
    ""use strict"";
    export class Tester {
        public value: string;
        protected val(): string {
            return this.value;
        }
        constructor() { }
    }
} 
```

And here is my test file (Tests/Test.ts)

```
/// <reference path=""../Scripts/typings/jasmine/jasmine.d.ts"" />

describe(""AnIntroductory"", () => {

    it(""DummyTest"", () => {
        // Fixture setup

    });
    it(""realTest"",() => {

I'm using the configuration as in the title but I cannot set Chutzpah up to work even if I've rad and tried all'about I've found about using direcly compiled js files, compile with specifying tsc to use, and so on. I'm sure it's my fault but I can't find out the solution it may work for me and now I'm very confused. All the code seems to compile well and using only quint in another project and, without Chutzpah, sync and async tests works fine. 

My files are organized in this way: 

SolutionDir/cm/data/*.ts => all the classes I want to test are in the CM-project (there are also other folders other than data but for the moment I would be happy let it work for data) 

SolutionDir/cm/scipts/*.ts => support classes for all classes in data (only 2 classes are used and 2 .d.ts). 

SolutionDir/tests/unit/data/.ts => all the unit-tests classes are in a separate Tests-project, normally organized in 1 or more files thought to test 1 specific cm/data/xxx.ts file-class using 1 or more test() clause. Also here I have other ./unit/otherforders/.ts files that tests the same ./cm/data files or other files in ./cm/otherfolders. But I would be happy for now to let the ./data/\* bring to work. 

SolutionDir/tests/unit/Facroty.ts => factory class I use within allmost all tests and is ""referenced"" within the test files. 

Premise: 
I've installed the ""Chutzpah Test Runner Context Menu Extension"" and what here reported comes from starting every time the same test file (with only 1 test() clause) by right click on them and select then ""Chutzpah-ICON Run JS Tests"" entry.
I've placed the Chutzpah.json file and/or the complile.bat file in SolutionDir/tests/unit/data.
Installing the ""Chutzpah Test Adapter for the Test Explorer"" the errors compares on the output windows under the voice ""test"" every time I compile all
Case 1: not using any Chutzpah.json file 
i got many of these: errors TS1056: Accessors are only available when targeting ECMAScript 5 and higher. 
I've verified and the errors refers to the use of getters and setters of TS. 

Case 2: using only ES5 flag: 
Chutzpah.json file: 
{
""TypeScriptCodeGenTarget"": ""ES5""
} 
and I got many of these: error TS1008: Unexpected token; 'constructor, function, accessor or variable' expected. 
I've verified and the errors refers to the use of ""protected"" accessor modifiers and so on of TS 1.3. 

Case 3: try to use external flag: 
Chutzpah.json file: 
{
""TypeScriptCodeGenTarget"": ""ES5"",
""Compile"": {
    ""Mode"": ""External"",
    ""SourceDirectory"": ""../../../../CM/data""
}
} 
and I got only this unique error: 
Error: Called start() while already started (QUnit.config.semaphore was 0 already) 
While Running:C:\TFS\ChefMagic\dev-cm\Tests\Unit\data\Activity_tests.ts 

Case 3: try to use external flag and path settings: 
Chutzpah.json file: 
{
""TypeScriptCodeGenTarget"": ""ES5"",
""Framework"": ""qunit"",
""Compile"": {
    ""Mode"": ""External"",
    ""Extensions"": [ "".ts"" ],
    ""ExtensionsWithNoOutput"": [ "".d.ts"" ],
    ""SourceDirectory"": ""../../../../CM/data"",
    ""OutDirectory"": ""../../../../CM/data""
},
""Tests"": [
    { ""Include"": ""_.ts"", ""Exclude"": ""_.d.ts"" }
],
""References"": [
    { ""Include"": ""../../../../CM/_/_.ts"", ""Exclude"": ""../../../../CM/_/_.d.ts"" }
]
} 
and i get the same error as before: 
Error: Called start() while already started (QUnit.config.semaphore was 0 already) 
While Running:C:\TFS\ChefMagic\dev-cm\Tests\Unit\data\Activity_tests.ts 

Case 4: specify the tsc for compile: 
Chutzpah.json file: 
{
""TypeScriptCodeGenTarget"": ""ES5"",
""Framework"": ""qunit"",
""Compile"": {
    ""Extensions"": [ "".ts"" ],
    ""ExtensionsWithNoOutput"": [ "".d.ts"" ],
    ""Executable"": ""compile.bat"",
    ""SourceDirectory"": ""../../../../CM/data"",
    ""OutDirectory"": ""../../../../CM/data""
},
""Tests"": [
    { ""Include"": ""_.ts"", ""Exclude"": ""_.d.ts"" }
],
""References"": [
    { ""Include"": ""../../../../CM/data/_.ts"", ""Exclude"": ""../../../../CM/data/_.d.ts"" }
]
} 
complie.bat file: 
@echo off 
tsc Activity_tests.ts --sourcemap 

and i got the same errors as before: TS1056 and TS1008 that relates to the use of ES5 and TS1.3 

Note: If I now remove the Chutzpah.json file at all I got this error: 
Chutzpah Error: ChutzpahCompilationFailedException - File not found 
While Running:C:\TFS\ChefMagic\dev-cm\Tests\Unit\data\chutzpah.json 

So, what's wrong with me? It's important to notice that VS2015 comes with TS allready installed but it seems not to work and so it was necessary to install TS1.3 for 2013 on top of VS2015 after it was ready and then all seems to work perfectly (compilation and quint tests without Chutzpah). 

Thank you in advance.

The problem seems to be that the RequireJs dependency that I have specified in my test is only using the filename and not what I have specified so it is looking for the Base.js file in the scripts folder instead of the scripts/Common folder.

The baseUrl needs to point to the scripts folder because some of the components that I will be testing have dependencies that are specified expecting the baseUrl to be the scripts folder.

There are quite a few examples of mocha tests written in typescript.  They use a very limited set of typescript capabilities.  How about being able to use a class declaration which would then enable inheritance and use of utilities and command test code in a base class.

I tried it, suspecting that I may be pushing the limits.  I'm also putting my basic knowledge of Javascript to the test as well.  

To get the typescript compiler to create some javascript I created a typescript file as follows and compiled it with the --module commonjs switch

``` javascript
/// <reference path='../../typings/tsd.d.ts' />
/// <reference path=""../../typings/mocha/mocha.d.ts"" />
/// <reference path=""../../typings/assert/assert.d.ts"" />

import assert = require('assert'); 

class TestClassEx {

  constructor() {
    console.log('Test constructor');
  }

  describe = (""User Management Service Login Unit Tests"", () => {

    beforeEach(() => {
      console.log('Before Each');
    });

    afterEach(() => {
      console.log('After Each');
    });

    it(""Test 1"", (done) => {
      assert(true);
      done();
    });

    it(""Test 2"", (done) => {
      assert(false);
      done();
    });

  });

}
```

When compiled you get what looks like a nodejs module.  This is something that mocha cannot run as it's a shape it's not familiar with and maybe it's not even possible - I don't know.  mocha will report 0 passing when run on the command line.

So am I barking up the wrong tree?  

``` javascript
/// <reference path='../../typings/tsd.d.ts' />
/// <reference path=""../../typings/mocha/mocha.d.ts"" />
/// <reference path=""../../typings/assert/assert.d.ts"" />
var assert = require('assert');

var TestClassEx = (function () {
    function TestClassEx() {
        this.describe = (""User Management Service Login Unit Tests"", function () {
            beforeEach(function () {
                console.log('Before Each');
            });

            afterEach(function () {
                console.log('After Each');
            });

            it(""Test 1"", function (done) {
                assert(true);
                done();
            });

            it(""Test 2"", function (done) {
                assert(false);
                done();
            });
        });
        console.log('Test constructor');
    }
    return TestClassEx;
})();

- Console runner gains a /lcov <path> switch that generates LCOV output
- Transforms (junit and lcov) can now be configured via chutzpah.json, relative and absolute paths for output supported

Example chutzpah.json:

```
{
    ""EnableCodeCoverage"": ""true"",
    ""References"": [
        { ""Path"": ""../code1.js"" },

LCOV output requires `EnableCodeCoverage` to be true and either the /lcov switch specified on the command-line or an entry in the `Transforms` collection as above. Output is relative to the chutzpah.json file. Forward-slashes or escaped backslashes should be used where required.

To make it all easily testable actually touched quite a few files - notably, `IFileSystemWrapper` now needs injected into `SummaryTransformer` instances, which then has associated knock-ons.

First of all: Keep up the great work, your Chutzpah-repo is a really nice set of tools.
Thanks a lot for that :)

We're building a web app containing several TypeScripts containing logic and tests (>30 .ts-files atm).
Now we've noticed that every TS unit tests gets displayed multiple times in the VS 2013 test explorer.

The test explorer displays every test multiplied with the number of .ts-files containing tests.
Example: if we have 8 ""*-spec.ts"" files each ""it()"" appears 8 times in the test explorer.

I guess Visual Studio 2013's TypeScript ""implicit reference"" mechanism (TypeScriptCompile) is the reason for this. Is there any workaround?

Regards,
Kantiran

I have tried to manually add the package in packages.config in my Web project

```
  <package id=""Chutzpah"" version=""3.2.5"" targetFramework=""net451"" />
```

And by doing this, I would have imagined that TeamCity would install the package and enable me to use a commandline build step to run a command line 

```
chutzpah.console.exe ./Test/tests
```

Running this command in Visual Studio runs all my tests fine. But when I look at the TeamCity build log. I can see that it fails on this step, with a

We changed our server api to filter requests based on this header, and now all the tests that were working cannot be rewritten to work with the new limitation.

Other approaches to changing the user agent header, like overriding the browser property, do not work at all, since phantom's page object creates a sandbox with preset values, i.e., it will always use the same header, unless another one is specified through the page.settings.userAgent property.

My actual need is only the user agent setting, but his could be extended to anything related to phantomjs that chutzpah uses. Perhaps another extension point that could interfere in the creation of each object and set custom properties or something similar. Ideally, it would be possible to set these options from within the test itself, since each test could set a different user agent string, or it could be dynamic, in which case a static extension point would also not help.

I had to completely delete my tests that relied on the user agent header, because there wasn't even a workaround to the issue.

```

.. this makes it hard to figure out what happened at the end when the total number of tests run is less than expected. I did a diff on the output from two runs, after sorting them, and found that while every file was _started_ in the incomplete scenario, there were missing results lines for some tests. (Impossible to know which because the results are mixed randomly).

So I tried running the tests with the console runner e.g.

```
chutzpah.console /path ../my/app/root
```

It runs all the tests reliably. It also waits for each test to complete before starting the next one, showing the results after the test start notification in each case. 

Even if I set `/parallelism x` (where x > 1) it still doesn't seem to run them concurrently, like it does within the VS test runner.

So I have a few problems - the first is that I can't seem to mimic the conditions under which chutzpah is running from within VS on the command line. Being able to do that might help figure out the actual problem which is that some tests seem to not finish (without a timeout error), but not consistently, and not repeatably, even on identical consecutive runs.

If it helps, I'm using QUnit, AMD testing mode and lots of async with requireJS, requireJs within requireJS, promises, XHR, etc. though the failures seem to occur just as often on the simplest scenarios as the most complex.

Could get more advanced and split test file set by degree of parallelism (i.e. in above case 8 sets of about 10 files each) but this actually runs _slower_ than simply firing everything through one thread.

Anecdotally, above 1-big-test-file runs at about 15% CPU on one core while max-parallelism lots-of-test-files maxes out all cores.

In PhantomJS you can also disable this using the quot--local-to-remote-url-accessquot option, see

In this way, all the tests were always successfully run, still I had some errors on code coverage such as:

quotError: ReferenceError: Can't find variable: ko 
in file:///.../Scripts/knockout.validation.js (line 2) 
in file:///.../Scripts/knockout.validation.js (line 22) 
While Running:...\accordionmanager_test.jsquot quotError: Error: Mismatched anonymous define() module:quot I think this error appear for the non AMD modules as Q, knockout validation, toastr.

This approach is shown in the files: quotchutzpah_paths_to_all_dependencies.jsonquot and quotconfigurationForTest_without_require_config_dependencies.jsquot.

Second approach 

I dropped this approach of putting the dependencies in the file quotchutzpah.jsonquot and I configured all the dependencies with requireJs. I load the dependencies with:
require.config({
    paths: {
        quotjqueryquot: quot../Scripts/jquery-2.1.0.minquot,
        quotjquery.uiquot: quot../Scripts/jquery-ui-1.10.3.minquot,
        quotknockoutquot: quot../Scripts/knockout-2.3.0quot,
        quotknockout.validationquot: quot../Scripts/knockout.validation.debugquot,
        'Q': '../Scripts/q.min',
        quottoastrquot: quot../Scripts/toastrquot,
        'text': '../Scripts/text',
        'durandal': '../Scripts/durandal',
        'plugins': '../Scripts/durandal/plugins',
        'transitions': '../Scripts/durandal/transitions'
    },
    shim: {
        quotknockout.validationquot: {
            deps: ['knockout']
        },
        quotjquery.uiquot: {
            deps: ['jquery']
        }
    }
});

require([quotjqueryquot, quotknockoutquot, quotQquot, quottoastrquot, quotjquery.uiquot, quotknockout.validationquot],
    function(jquery, ko, q, toastr) {
        window.jQuery = jquery;
        window.ko = ko;
        window.Q = q;
        window.toastr = toastr;
    });

require([quotconfig/tests/fakeAppConfigForTestquot], function () { });
The file quotfakeAppConfigForTest.jsquot contains some settings which are taken from web.config file from the project under test.

With this second approach, the unit tests sometimes run successfully, sometimes fail with the errors:

quotError: ReferenceError: Can't find variable: ko 
in file:///.../Scripts/knockout.validation.debug.js (line 30)quot quotResult Message: Error: accordion() method does not exist in file:///.../MICROSOFT/VISUALSTUDIO/12.0/EXTENSIONS/.../jasmine/v2/jasmine.js (line 565)quot
quotResult Message: TypeError: 'undefined' is not an object (evaluating 'ko.validation.group') in file:///c:/programming/javascriptquot

I think these errors appear because of the asynchronous loading of the dependencies with the require call require([quotdepencencyNamequot], function(){}).

The same errors appear occasionally with the Code coverage. 
With this second approach, the error quotquotError: Error: Mismatched anonymous define() module:quot does not appear anymore.

This second approach can be seen in the files: quotchutzpah.jsonquot and quotconfigurationForTestquot.

I attached a project to reproduce the issues I encountered. 

Could you please tell me how can I load the global variables for the dependent libraries so that the unit tests and code coverage always run successfully?

Thank you for your support.

It would be great if Chutzpah could extend it's existing template support to support pure HTML templates like those used by AngularJS. We would envision the implementation being a variation of the html2Js plugin used by the Karma test runner. The syntax to
 include templates could mirror that used by the existing template support in Chutzpah.

Frist and foremost, thank you for writing Chutzpah, it's been useful for me at my organization.

We have configured Chutzpah in one of your projects. The test cases are discovered and run just fine. We're also able to run code coverage on the project. However, we are getting quotObject reference not set to an instance of an objectquot dialog errors
 from Visual Studio when opening our solution (see attached screenshot). I tracked down the problem to Chutzpah.

I'm attaching a minimal case that reproduces the problem. 

Basically, if you have an Entity Framework connection string in the web.config file of a solution, Chutzpah will trigger a database connection when collecting the project's items.

I debugged over chutzpah code and found the source of the error, this is the interesting part of the call trace:
...
System.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnection.Open
    ...
Microsoft.VisualStudio.Data.Package.DataConnection.EnsureConnected
Microsoft.VisualStudio.Data.Package.DataExplorerNode.EnumerateOrRefreshChildren
...
Microsoft.VisualStudio.Data.Package.DataExplorerConnection.TryGetProperty
Microsoft.VisualStudio.Data.Package.DataExplorerConnection.Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Interop.IVsHierarchy.GetProperty
VS11.Plugin.VsSolutionHelper.GetPropertyValue Line 84    ltltltltltltltltltltlt
VS11.Plugin.VsSolutionHelper.GetProjectItems Line 48
...
Chutzpah.VS2012.TestAdapter.ChutzpahTestContainerDiscoverer.FindPotentialTestFiles Line 376
Chutzpah.VS2012.TestAdapter.ChutzpahTestContainerDiscoverer.OnSolutionProjectChanged

It looks like the call to IVsHierarchy.GetProperty can cause database connections to get open when the project is using the Entity Framework.

If you try to open the minimal case you won't get the quotObject reference not set to an instance of an object.quot errors, as I have cleaned the connection strings in the web.config file. But you should be seeing a quotConnect to SQL Serverquot dialog
 instead. Also, if you debug Chutzpah and break on System.Data.SqlClient.SqlException, you should be getting one on the GetPropertyValue method of the VsSolutionHelper class in Chutzpah.

Also, please note that the minimal case solution can be opened without errors when you disable the Chutzpah Test Adapter plugin. We have found a work around, removing or commenting out Entity Framework's connection string in the web.config file avoids the errors
 to be thrown. So, fixing this is not urgent to us. However, it would be nice if Chutzpah stops triggering database connections.

Sometimes, when opening a particular solution, we will repeatedly get quotCannot Connect To Sql Serverquot error dialogs, followed by a number of quotObject Reference Not Setquot error dialogs.
 Other solution files work fine. 

This of course looks very much like some weird problem in our .sln file, and that's probably the root cause.

However, when I attached a second instance as a debugger, I noticed the error occuring with a call-stack originating in Chutzpah: It seems that the Chutzpah test-discoverer is a bit too liberal in searching for test-files. So while we'll probably be able to
 fix our immediate problem somewhere in our .sln or .suo file, there's still quite a decent performance gain to be had in Chutzpah.

I'm guessing this is not really intended behavior. 

We first noticed this error in 3.2.1, and I've just updated to 3.2.2, which doesnt seem to fix it.

I have a Mvc Web project, that I want to unit test the javascript files, however I do not what my tests in this project. So I decided to create another mvc project use it as the test project.

I have been able to setup chutzpah to work in the ide using the json settions file to get to the referneces and event code coverage to work with blanket.js. (file references) so that headless testing will work with phantomjs.exe.

Well Now that that is working, the fun begins. No developer in their right mind wants to work without intellisense..., Right?

So after some investigation, I can add back the ///ltreferencegt tags to the test files.

this seems to work, but then building becomes an issue for chutzpah is some of these will be HTTP references and can cause blanket.js to have cross-domain conflicts and fail..

So to correct that we add the chutzpah-excluded, attribute to the reference tag. Now the code coverage is fixed again.....But intellissense is broke again.

So, I decided to play with the extra attribute a bit, thinking that the word excluded itself had something to do with it, and after changing the attr name from chutzpah-exclude to just chutzpah, it worked, intellisense was restored.

I continued to play with it a bit and isolated it down to the fact that it is the quot-quot hyphen that is the actual issue. Intelisense is completely ignoring the reference tag if there is an attribute with a dash anywhere in it. granted this is a bug
 in intelisense but the easy solution is to chutzpah to support the attribute without the dash.

Has anyone else seen this issue?

I tried to setup a sample project using similar settings as the example, but so far have been unsuccessful in getting the solution explorer to show tests for TypeScript files whose JS files are NOT included in the solution. (We don't want to include the JS/MAP
 files generated from TypeScript files in the solution because they are removed on clean).

I have attached a sample solution which has two test files SimpleJsModuleTests.js and SimpleTsModuleTests.ts. These two test files test the SimpleJsModule.js and SimpleTsModule.ts modules respectively.

I have verified that both test files run successfully from both of the right-click context menu options (Run JS Tests and Open in browser).

Upon opening the solution you'll see that the test explorer only shows the four tests from the SimpleJsModuleTests.js file, while the other 4 tests from SimpleTsModuleTests.ts are not present. If I show all files in the solution explorer and right-click the
 generated SimpleTsModuleTests.js file and include it in the solution, the 4 additional tests will immediately show up in the solution explorer.

From the documentation it appears that using the Compile Mode External should allow me to have the tests from a TS file show up in the Test Explorer without including the generated JS file in the solution. Is this a correct assumption?

I am facing same issue with TFS 2012 as mentioned in another issue 
https://chutzpah.codeplex.com/workitem/213. Probably that ticket is closed hence posting this issue seperatly. The another post is not quite helpful in my case. It seems Chutzpah is not running test files. Every time build execution gives 0 test executed.
 However I can run same test from VS 2013 installed on same server and also from command prompt.

I have tried checking-in all files from vsix file as mentioned in 
http://blogs.msdn.com/b/visualstudioalm/archive/2012/07/09/javascript-unit-tests-on-team-foundation-service-with-chutzpah.aspx?CommentPosted=truePageIndex=2#comments

I have tried getting files from nuGet package. 
Both ways are not working. One thing I observed is, from VSIX or nuGet package I am not getting few DLLs as mentioned in above blog post

Chutzpah.VisualStudio.Settings.dll 
Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestPlatform.ObjectModel.dll 
SassAndCoffee.Core.dll 
SassAndCoddee.Javascript.dll 

Also, 
Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestPlatform.ObjectModel.dll this dll is not available in my local framework directories. I have TFS 2012 Update 3 and Visual Studio 2013 Professional.

From few blogs I see that this file should be available in VS11 folder, but that folder is not available in VS 2013.

Somehow I got this dll from other extension package (nodeunit) and I used it, but still it is not resolving issue.

Do I need other mentioned missing DLLs to make it work? How can I get those? 

I tried one more alternate approach, by modifying build template and invoking chutzpah.console.exe from InvokeProcess. Which seems to work and I can see result in log file.

But I don't know how can I check reuslt of unit test and integrate it with BuildDetails.TestStatus to make build fail if test case fails.

Any help would be greatly appreciated. 

Thanks amp Regards, 
Shailesh

Now, both my projects compile the TS code with no errors, but when I run my tests, Chutzpah fails to find 3 tests. The error I get is the same error I was seeing when I was working with TS 0.9.5. That is, some
 code I was writing in my project did not work with TS 0.9.5, but it did in the Playground from the TS web site (which I'm assuming was using 1.0) and today this code now compiles correctly. But Chutzpah seems to be compiling that code with an older version
 of TS, so I get the errors. 

Then after digging I found out about chutzpah.json and Compile settings. So I tried to add this:

{
quotFrameworkquot: quotqunitquot,
quotCompilequot :  {
    quotModequot :  quotExternalquot
}
} 

That caused all sorts of havoc, here's an example of one of the errors:

So, I'm confused as to what I'm supposed to set in chutzpah.json to tell it to not compile my code (VS will do that with my project automatically) and just evaluate the .js files for tests. What am I doing wrong with the json settings file? TIA.

 running it in my browser. In the console I can see that the wrong URL is being used to load the test file.

I left the generated harness in the ZIP file (as _Chutzpah.fee23f2ac30325a47f946e34b7df81eb.test.html) so it can be examined. Basically it is trying to load a URL that has repeated quot/Tests/quot in the path:

One of the reasons is the limited support for requirejs in the fact that when enabled it loads requirejs first in all cases.

I'm using chutzpah test adapter for the test explorer 3.0.1. When I start VS and go to the Test Explorer, I can see the output in the quotTestsquot console. It shows ------ Discover test started ------ and then has a timeout for every one of my test files:
 quotError: Timeout occured when executing test filequot. 
I do have the chutzpah logging enabled, and it spits out lots of good stuff, but every discovered test file ends with phantom complaining that it timed out.

I was considering upgrading to 3.2.1, but when I installed it locally, I started getting failures when running tests from chutzpah context menu or console. The tests themselves succeeded, but they started failing because of functionality in a document.ready
 function...which previously didn't seem to be executed during test execution. I believe the two problems are related. I was not worried about the js tests not showing up in test explorer because they were still executable from the context menu or console.
 But if 3.2.1 is going to start failing because the execution of the document.ready function, then I realize I need a better picture into what's really going on.

The sample I'm attaching does not have any references to a document.ready function, so I think that I may be off on that thought...but it is still a problem with 3.2.1 where the execution of the document.ready function causes errors. It seems that in previous
 versions (at least in 3.0.1), the document.ready was not being run). 

I included the chutzpah.log that was generated by the test discovery process. 

Any help you can provide is much appreciated.

I've been experimenting with adding Chutzpah to our TFS 2012 build server. Initially everything looked promising but I encountered a ReferenceError issue as soon as I got beyond the initial use case.

It sounds similar to 
https://chutzpah.codeplex.com/workitem/217 but whereas they're home and dry I am unfortunately not :-(

The error I encountered was this: (names changed)
ReferenceError: Can't find variable: xyz in file:///C:/Builds/1/ [...] /xyzTests.js (line 13)
The xyz variable is defined in xyzViewModel.js and it is referenced in the test file like this:
/// ltreference path=quot../../../../../Scripts/jasmine.jsquot chutzpah-exclude=quottruequot /gt
/// ltreference path=quot../../../../../Scripts/Areas/Views/xyz/xyzViewModel.jsquot /gt
xyzTests.js was given a BuildAction of None and a Copy to Output Directory of
Copy always. 
xyzViewModel.js was given a BuildAction of Content and I changed the Copy to Output Directory to
Copy always to try and rectify the problem. Unfortunately it didn't fix the issue.

I'm a little stuck now and wondering if I'm missing something.... Any thoughts anyone?

I'm using Chutzpah 3.1, I was following the instructions in the blog post on 
Javascript Unit Tests on Team Foundation Service with Chutzpah and the version of Chutzpah used on the build server was taken from the

latest VSIX / zip. 

UPDATE 

I appear to have solved my problem. Step 7 of the blog post I was following says:
Make sure that the js files (that contain the tests) are getting copied to the build output directory.

This appears to suggest that test files should be set to quotCopy alwaysquot. Setting this to actually be quotDo not copyquot fixed my problem and I was able to confirm that tests were run as expected.

So that's good news and I'm left with 2 small questions if anyone could pitch in:

I'm presuming that Chutzpah must have changed since that blog post was written so the quotCopy alwaysquot step is no longer required. Is there any detail available on that?

At present I have a quottestsquot folder in the root of my web app which duplicates the folder structure of the quotscriptsquot folder and contains any test files appropriately nested. The downside of this is that the tests get pushed out when I
 hit quotpublishquot which is not really what I want. Is there a straightforward way to prevent this?

I'm tryng to use Chutzpah.3.1.1 to run Jasmine tests. 

When using a chutzpah.json file from chutzpah.console.exe, I'm getting 

System.ArgumentException: Expecting a .js, .ts, .coffee or .html file or a url

The Path, Include and Exclude are always null inside ChutzpahTestSettingsFile. This appears to be because ServiceStack.Text is not deserializing the collection of SettingsFileTestPath for some reason.

When I switch serializer to newtonsoft, it deserializes ok but then got another error:

Newtonsoft.Json.JsonReaderException: JSON integer 1393870366063 is too large or small for an Int32

I then changed JsFileDone.TimeTaken to a long and it worked. 

My final issue is that I'm struggling with include/excludes in the references. It seems to be loading files that I'm explicitly excluding among other weirdness. I'll elaborate on that later though

Meanwhile I've attached what I changed so far.

We have upgraded to Chutzpah 3.1 and we are making great use of the support for Require which has greatly reduced the complexity of our tests when requiring async modules. The only issue we have now is that we want to use mocking for Require dependencies, so
 for example, a ViewModel might be under test, but this depends on a service module which goes off and gets data. We would like to mock the Service module when testing the ViewModel module. Before we upgraded Chutzpah, we were using the Squire framework but
 it does not look like this will be possible now, as Chutzpah takes care of requiring the module under test. Do you know if it possible to mock Require module dependencies in Chutzpah 3.1? We are using the Jasmine testing framework.

Thanks for all of your time and help!

A workaround exists which is to not use the baseUrl, but instead just tell Chutzpah where to place the test harness. This is done by setting the TestHarnessDirectory property within the chutzpah.json file.

A suggestion has been made to fix Chutzpah by allowing you to specify a relative AMD baseurl separately to Chutzpah in the chutzpah.json file. This would mean you would specify it in both the chutzpah.json and requirejs config files.

Actually it's not an issue but I'm really confused on how to config the Chutzpah.json, the references part.

I have a very complicated JavaScript project (RequireJS&#43;Mocha are most important from my perspective), which has many libraries it depends on: jquery, sinon, knockout, kendo, requireJS, mocha.... (might be more)

Thus, my configuration is like this: 
{
    quotFrameworkquot: quotmochaquot,
    quotMochaInterfacequot: quottddquot,
    quotTestHarnessReferenceModequot: quotAMDquot,
    quotTestHarnessLocationModequot: quotSettingsFileAdjacentquot,
    quotReferencesquot : [  
        { quotPathquot: quotchai.jsquot, quotIsTestFrameworkFilequot: quottruequot },
        {quotPathquot : quotjquery.jsquot },
                {quotPathquot : quotkendo.web.min.jsquot },
                {quotPathquot : quotknockout-3.0.0.jsquot },
                {quotPathquot : quotknockout-kendo.jsquot },
                {quotPathquot : quotsinon.jsquot },
                {quotPathquot : quotrequire-2.1.8.jsquot }
    ]
}
However, the running result will easily suffer from quotmismatched anonymous define() quot error because RequireJS does not like hard-code script loading in the html file, which seems to be how Chutzpah is doing in the temporary html. For example, knockout
 depends on jquery, so if jquery is loaded after the knockout, there will be this error.

Another thing is, the given Sample of RequireJS-Mocha is good, but it leaves me confused that should we config these libraries (jquery, knockout, etc.) at Chutzpah.json, or at config.js? Looks like config.js could define dependencies, while Chutzpah.json can't.

I'm trying to integrate Chutzpah for our Mocha and RequiredJS. I have a simple test like:

UnitTest.js
  define(function(require) {
      var expect = chai.expect;
      suite(quotMiddlequot, function() {
          test(quotEasiest, threequot, function() {
              expect(1).to.be.equals(1);
          });
     });
  }); 
But when I run it from command line, quotChutzpah.exe UnitTest.js /debug /tracequot, it will tell me 0 test found; I open the _Chutzpah.*.html it generated, I found that the problem is:

The script is loaded in quotHeaderquot, like:
ltscript type=quottext/javascriptquotgt
    mocha.setup('tdd');
lt/scriptgt
ltscript type=quottext/javascriptquot src=quotfile:///E:/js/UnitTest.jsquotgtlt/scriptgt

and in the body, amdTestPath is empty:
 var amdTestPath = quotquot;

However, 

if I simply delete the script of loading UnitTest.js above, and add it in amdTestPath, like:
 var amdTestPath = quotUnitTestquot;

and then run the Phamtomjs.exe from the Chutzpah log directly, like:
  phantomjs.exe --proxy-type=none quotmochaRunner.jsquot _Chutzpah.*.test.htmlquot execution 5000

It works (show me there is one test tested, and passed) 

Am I missing some Chutzpah.json settings? Why this happens?

For example I have my directory structure like this:
static\
  scripts\
    SomeModule\
      GlobalObject.SomeModule.Utils.js
      GlobalObject.SomeModule.Models.js
      GlobalObject.SomeModule.js
    GlobalObject.js
  tests\
I replicate the directory and file structure in tests\, but on the files I insert .Tests right before the .js extension

Okay so that being said. So if I wante to test GlobalObject.SomeModule.Models.js I would have a file named
GlobalObject.SomeModule.Models.Tests.js. The way I have my tests and coverage set up I run each test file and only collect code coverage for the file that it's testing. To me it seems like code coverage on files not being tested is useless. So
 I let razor generate my html using a layout and all that and so I can include any .js files that are dependencies for the file I am wanting to test and add a
data-cover flag to the script tag that I want covered. 

I'm just wondering is there a way to duplicate that functionality. For example it would be nice if you had to specify what you want covered instead of Chutzpah covering everything...

Using the example above I would do this in my GlobalObject.SomeModule.Models.Tests.js file:
/// ltchutzpah_reference path=quotGlobalObject.jsquot /gt
/// ltchutzpah_reference path=quotGlobalObject.SomeModule.jsquot /gt
/// ltchutzpah_reference path=quotGlobalObject.SomeModule.Models.jsquot data-cover /gt

/\* Test code would go here and it would only be testing GlobalObject.SomeModule.Models.js thus that would be the only thing blanket needs to instrument/cover */

Please let me know your thoughts on this and I hope that it makes sense. I really like the idea of Chutzpah especially because of the Visual Studio and TFS integration, but currently it will not work for us, but that being said I don't think what I'm asking
 is too crazy seeing as that's how blanket.js works.

I've recently tried to implement Chutzpah and qUnit to test some typescript code and have come up with an issue where I can run Chutzpah no problems to test a simple ok(quotyeyquot === quotyeyquot, quotoh no!quot) assertion in qUnit, but as soon
 as I try to dip into my TypeScript code I get:
'undefined' is not a constructor (evaluating 'new DMC.TreeBurst.Node({
                    id: 1,
                    parentId: null,
                    title: quotquot
                })')
The DMC.TreeBurst.Node is a TypeScript class and my test is a simple demo:

///ltreference path=quot../typings/qunit/qunit.d.tsquot /gt
///ltreference path=quotreferences.tsquotgt
///ltreference path=quotreferences.jsquotgt

module DMC.TreeBurst {

```
QUnit.module(quotTreeBurst.Node.ts testsquot);

test(quotLoad-a-single-node-creates-correctlyquot, () =gt {

    var node = [new DMC.TreeBurst.Node({
        id: 1,
        parentId: null,
        title: quotquot
    })];

    ok(node, quotNode not create correctly with valid constructor parametersquot);

});
```

I believe it may be some kind of namespacing/referencing issue as when I take the test out of my DMC.TreeBurst module it tells me it's unable to resolve DMC (the root namespace for my typescript application).

Are there any tricks and tips on using Chutzpah with TypeScript and qUnit? I'd very much appreciate any suggestions or ideas.

Kind Regards, 

Doug

Unfortunately, chutzpah alone is larger than the attachment limit, so I have added the project to dropbox:

I made two bat files, one for running the tests under phantom, and one for running under chutzpah, in the root directory to make things easy.

The scheme being used was copied from the Durandal testing framework. PhantomJS runs the tests just fine, but the closest I could come with Chutzpad was getting it to discover the tests (but they would all pass no matter what).

So, chutzpah.json changes are not effective until Visual Studio restarts. Is that by design? If yes, maybe it should be mentioned in the docs (or maybe it is but I did not find it). If not, it should be easy for you to reproduce it.

I'm trying to shell to the version 2.5.0 console exe and when kicking off the process from C# the process hangs and never returns. I have to loop and interrogate StdOut to know the task is complete. Using process.WaitForExit, or hooking the Process_Exited event
 both hang until I grow frustrated and kill them. 

Using the following code, the arguments variable is set to 
/debug /file chutzpah_test_runner.html 

chutzpah_test_runner.html is a copy of jasmine.html with the placeholders replaced by all of the test files.

I'm attached a VS2012 repro demo. Had to remove Phantom.exe and the json.net nuget package to be under the 4 MB limit. You can either run the console app, or the unit test in the Build project.

Uncomment this section to see the error (hopefully):
            // THIS DOES NOT WORK - NEVER RETURNS
            //process.WaitForExit(1000 \* 60 \* secondsToWait);
Here is the relevant code...
            var process = new Process()
            {
                StartInfo = new ProcessStartInfo()

```
        process.Start();

        var secondsToWait = 20;

        string IsComplete = quotTests completequot;

        string output = string.Empty;

        // THIS DOES NOT WORK - NEVER RETURNS

        // check each second to see if the process has exited
        for (var i = 0; i lt secondsToWait; i&#43;&#43;)
        {
            output = process.StandardOutput.ReadToEnd();
            if (output.Contains(IsComplete) || output.Contains(NoTests))
            {
                break;
            }

            {
                Debug.WriteLine(quotWaiting {0} of {1} seconds for results...quot, i &#43; 1, secondsToWait);
                process.Refresh();
                Thread.Sleep(1000);
            }
        }

        string error = process.StandardError.ReadToEnd();

        process.Close();
        return string.IsNullOrEmpty(error) ampamp !output.Contains(NoTests) ampamp TestsPassed(output);

Any thoughts?? 

PS: This works just perfectly when I run this from the command line. It only doesn't work when I run this from within C#...

This causes issues with bundling since a bundle could include all .js in a folder which (after running test with Chutzpah) includes the .js files that chutzpah has compiled.

Bundling a complete folder is very common if you have a large amount of .ts files.

Is it possible to :

have a testfolder that contains all reccessary files for the test:

.html in the root the root is the common folder base for all testfiles. 
configure the testfolder path,

Example: 
Test structure:

C:\Projects\Solution1\TestProject\BrowserTest.ts C:\Projects\Solution1\WebApplicaition1\Scripts\BrowserTest.ts TestFolder path: C:\Projects\Solution1\TestProject\TestsCache

This would give the testfolder: 
Root: C:\Projects\Solution1\TestProject\TestsCache\c108fc155bec3def8d323ea7928455c0

Contents:

C:\Projects\Solution1\TestProject\TestsCache\c108fc155bec3def8d323ea7928455c0\TestProject\BrowserTest.js

C:\Projects\Solution1\TestProject\TestsCache\c108fc155bec3def8d323ea7928455c0_Chutzpah.test.html

Pros:

All files for a testrun within a folder No conflict with bundling when running the site, since the .js files that chutzpah compiles is placed in a text folder outside the webapplication.

Chutzpah is integrated into the build system so we run the following command at build time:
chutzpah.console.exe myTestSuite.html /silent /debug /timeoutMilliseconds 30000
Now the output of the tests is very verbose so the console is then flooded with log messages (a good thing). On occasion there'll be failing tests and the console will contain something like quotx number of tests failedquot etc. at the very end of the exe
 run. This is great in determining that tests failed but not so great in determining which tests and why they failed.

In essence I could scroll up and look through the several thousand lines of debug output in an attempt to find out what tests failed and why but with so many lines of output it becomes pretty impossible.

It'd be great if the debug option also re-output the failing tests and their corresponding logs at the end of the test run. This way all failures are in one location and are easy to decipher potential failure causes.

I'm having an issue using relative paths in chutzpah.json for files to include in code coverage metrics.

I have 2 VS projects set up, one for src and one for tests and I'm trying to use relative paths to define the includes between the projects.

Chutzpah appears to be ignoring a path like: ....\ProjectName\src\file.js 

Is this a known issue? Is there a work around?

I've included a sample of the problem. Apologies as this may be user error but this is the only way to upload a file rather than discussions

In the project there are two tests. Both of which make use of requirejs. The only difference between the two is that one pulls in jquery in the dependancies.

If I run the tests using the context menu 'Run JS Tests' then it finds an runs both tests fine. However If I try and use the test adapter it only finds the one without the jquery reference.

Now I'm willing to bet its to do with the hack to set my base url in requirejs in main.js, but I can't think of a better way?

However, I'm thinking this sort of thing should not just fail silently. Is there anything that can be done about this?

Thanks 
Mat 

P.s. hopefully I've included everything?

I'm just playing about with Chutzpah and so far it's worked great running my 
spec.html file. However maintaining the spec.html file is an overhead I'd rather not have.

I considered adding /// reference declarations to my test files, but I then hit a snag whereby I have to specify each file individually to test when calling chutzpah.

Can I propose a few ideas to ease test runs: 

The first solution would be to allow globbing of files names, much like you do with code coverage, so i can give a pattern for all my tests. That way the spec files themselves are the one truth (no
spec.html!), and I won't have to write a powershell script to do this for me.

the second option is inspired the grunt-jasmine task (if you're unfamiliar with grunt, it's a JS based task runner for builds, tests etc). Basically, to configure the grunt-jasmine task you can use a configuration like this:
jasmine : {
    options : {
        specs : 'spec/_.js'
    },
    src : 'src/_.js'
},

As you can see, this allows me to glob both my source and spec files, meaning I never have to update my configuration after the initial setup and I don't have to worry about maintaining a
spec.html or /// reference declarations. For more info, see then
grunt-jasmine readme

Let me know what you thinkI

This is causing all sorts of Cross-Origin-Policy (because of different protocols) when you're code is doing ajax calls to your website/webserver via HTTP/HTTPs.

The bug is due to a limitation of Uri.LocalPath, which does not convert local drive-letter based file paths correctly.

If the URI represents a path of the form:
file:///c:/myfile.js
Then uri.LocalPath will return:
/c:/myfile.js
It should return:
c:/myfile.js
instead. A work-around is to apply the following after getting uri.LocalPath (around line 115 of BlanketJsCoverageEngine.cs):

On Windows 7 and using Chutzpah 2.3.0 I now consistently get a timeout error when running tests either from VS 2012 (quotRun JS Testsquot) or from the console if I'm running from a directory other than the one containing chutzpah.console.exe.

I can run tests from VS 2012 in the browser fine, but not if I do /openInBrowser from the console (which tries to run the tests before opening the test harness in the browser). I'm guessing there's some communication issue with phantomjs because I see the phantomjs
 process start when I trigger the tests. 

At least I have two options that work (running in browser from VS 2012 and running from console from the same directory) so it's not a show-stopper for me, just a bit annoying.

Any ideas?

I just came across a little gotcha with the QUnit test runner in 2.3. In qunitRunner.js, the following code:
function onQUnitLoaded() {

```
// If additional referenced to QUnit are loaded trick them to not pollute global namespace
window.exports = window.exports || {};
```

causes some libraries, e.g., PubSub, lodash, to think they're in a CommonJS environment and therefore not register themselves in the global namespace. I came across it when some of my tests started breaking in the console but not when running in the browser.

I got around it by adding an extra script include at the head of the references list that removed windows.export and all worked fine after that.

This is really a QUnit problem, more details at:

We are using TFS 2012 and VS 2012 with .NET 4.5. The problem is at VS2012.TestAdapter\ChutzpahAdapterSettings.cs in the ToXml method. It could be the override does not match that of the loaded assembly of Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestPlatform.ObjectModel.dll.

from LoRez: 

quot...It looks like I have a newer version of the Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestPlatform.ObjectModel.dll on my machine. My machine has version 11.0.51106.1 in C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 11.0\Common7\IDE\CommonExtensions\Microsoft\TestWindow.
 Whereas the adapter seems to be using version 11.0.50907.0. It looks like the signature for ToXml hasn't changed from what you've implemented...quot

This problem does not seem to occur with tfs.visualstudio.com, but on a stand-alone build server. I believe the reason that this problem cannot be reproduced on tfs.visualstudio.com is that it only happens when Visual Studio 2012 is installed on the build server.
 That way it cannot load the version of Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestPlatform.ObjectModel.dll from your build assemblies folder because it is already loaded in memory on the build server.

For example if you were to write a JavaScript module using an external library, you'll likely add a reference to it for the helpful autocomplete at design time. But if you decide to use a fake version of the library for unit testing (referenced in the test
 suite), the two will end up colliding when Chutzpah spiders through the references - the fake version from the suite, and the real version from the class under test.

When using the /openInBrowser flag, prepare all files as usual, but do not run the tests in chutzpah, open the browser immediately and then exit without displaying any statistics (there are none).

We are running Chutzpah 2.2.1 in Visual Studio 2010 had some issues with vsdoc files which are unexpectantly loaded during tests.

We have the following references in our test file:
/// ltreference path=quotjquery-1.7.1-vsdoc.jsquot /gt
/// ltreference path=quotjquery-1.7.1.jsquot /gt
/// ltreference path=quotFileUnderTest.jsquot /gt

The file-under-test quotFileUnderTest.jsquot has the following reference paths for intellisense purpose:
/// ltreference path=quotjquery-1.7.1-vsdoc.jsquot /gt
/// ltreference path=quotNotifications.jsquot /gt

The file quotNotifications.jsquot is another one of our files which has the following reference paths:
/// ltreference path=quotjquery-1.5.1-vsdoc.jsquot /gt
/// ltreference path=quotjquery.validate-vsdoc.jsquot /gt

This results in the following scripts to be included in the Head when running the tests in the browser:
ltheadgt ltscript type=quottext/javascriptquot src=quotfile:///C:/xxx/jquery-1.7.1.jsquotgtlt/scriptgt ltscript type=quottext/javascriptquot src=quotfile:///C:/xxx/jquery-1.5.1-vsdoc.jsquotgtlt/scriptgt ltscript type=quottext/javascriptquot
 src=quotfile:///C:/xxx/jquery.validate-vsdoc.jsquotgtlt/scriptgt ltscript type=quottext/javascriptquot src=quotfile:///C:/xxx/Notifications.jsquotgtlt/scriptgt ltscript type=quottext/javascriptquot src=quotfile:///C:/xxx/FileUnderTest.jsquotgtlt/scriptgt
 lt/headgt As you can see above, quotjquery-1.5.1-vsdoc.jsquot and quotjquery.validate-vsdoc.jsquot are both loaded as well.

It seems that any vsdoc files referenced by either the test file or the file-under-test file such as the quotquotjquery-1.7.1-vsdoc.jsquot above, are ignored as I would have expected.

However, it seems that any files referenced by the file-under-test file, such as the quotNotifications.jsquot above, has all their referenced vsdoc files loaded.

That caused an issue for us as the jquery-1.5.1-vsdoc.js file contains the line quotvar jQuery = (function() {...}quot overwriting the 1.7.1 jquery object during testing.

In our particular example above we had legacy vsdoc references in our files to 1.5.1, left from a previous jquery upgrade but I would have expected those files to be ignored by Chutzpah.

When we updated the vsdoc reference in quotNotifications.jsquot to the correct 1.7.1 vsdoc version, Chutzpah crashed as it overwrote the 1.7.1 jquery object with the 1.7.1 vsdoc jquery object, preventing Chutzpah to load the tests in the browser all together.

I would have expected for no vsdoc files to be loaded.

Could you let me know please if this is expected behaviour or if indeed those vsdoc files should not be loaded.

I have locally fixed this issue but I want to share the knowledge ... 
We run chutzpah in a post-build event and the problematic build was triggered as a gated-checkin build from the TFS Service. The output was:

For consistency purpose we have Chutzpah checked in the TFS - so I have the same file versions. But when I login on the TFS system and start the build per msbuild I don't get the error.

The error occures because:

The jasmine files in the chutzpah folder are read-only (because they came from TFS)
The TFS-Service is running 24/7 and therefore gets the same temporary folder for the tests

So chutzpah copies the jasmine files (including the readonly flag) to the temp-folder and the first build passes without errors but every further build has this error because it tries to overwrite a readonly file ...

So as mentioned above I have corrected the readonly flags on the files manually. But it took some time to realized the problem ...

mmanela,chutzpah,https://api.github.com/repos/mmanela/chutzpah/issues/65,42844031,MDU6SXNzdWU0Mjg0NDAzMQ==,65,Issue with temp Javascript file created from TypeScript during test run,304410,closed,FALSE,NA,NA,5,2014-09-16T04:45:05Z,2014-09-16T04:45:07Z,2014-09-16T04:45:07Z,OWNER,NA,"<b>vrossi[CodePlex]</b> <br />The output of the temp javascript file is inconsistent from the javascript file that is output when I save a TypeScript file in Visual Studio. Also, it appears like it's missing the necessary code to make quot_superquot work properly and is causing
 my tests to fail. Here's an example... 

Here is the output when I save the TypeScript file in Visual Studio: 

var Test = (function (_super) {
__extends(Test, _super);
function Test() {
    _super.call(this);
}

This is the output of the temp file that is created when running tests: 

var Test = (function () {
function Test() {
    _super.prototype();
}

You'll notice that the initial function definition is missing the _super parameter as well as the call to __extends. When this object is created it tries to call _super.prototype() and fails.

I'm not sure is there is a different with the settings you're using when compiling the TypeScript into Javascript, but if I just use the output Javascript from TypeScript file, everything works great.

Would be much better if test runners themselves determined if they support a JS file. So simply load all the runners in the JSRunners directory and add a simple function:

function isSupportedTestFile(fileName, contents); 

So my customRunner.js would simply implement this function and you then continue on as per usual. This would allow others just to add custom runners without even requiring the source to Chutzpah.

I guess this would add a slight overhead but I cannot imagine it would be a considerable amount.

Its kind of hard to duplicate, but if you have quotRun tests after buildquot checked in VS2012, and quickly change your test names, save, change them again, and save, the test runner output says:

This works, but would be reliant on HTML output in a specific format.

Jasmine supports the notion of quotreportersquot, which are basically classes that take the Jasmine data and output it in a usable format. See jasmine-html.js for an example of a report (the default reporter that comes with Jasmine). Instead of parsing
 HTML, a custom reporter could be used to directly exposes the required data (perhaps as a JSON object). This would be more reliable than parsing HTML.

Jasmine-species1
 is an addin to Jasmine that adds additional test styles. Notably, it adds the ability to use BDD scenario (quotgiven, when, thenquot) syntax2.

Chutzpah doesn't detect these test files as Jasmine tests, and hence doesn't run them correctly. I managed to get it working by adding the correct references (via /// ltreference ...gt) and adding a comment like the following:

/// it('dummy') 

However, this does seem like a hack. A short-term fix might be to search for quotgiven(...)quot and quotfeature(...)quot as well as quotit(...)quot.

I appreciate the contributor/author to provide such great idea and cost time to implement it.

In this PR, I have rewritten those codes by a different new way to boost performance and to apply it to all controls.

### Performance enhancement

Speed up to 3-6x (test locally) in following scenarios.

- Toggle between the mode of if need to collapse unchanged sections.
- Modify the count of the context line. Context lines are the ones unchanged around others but keep visible to let end-users have a way to get context.

### Controls

The old implementation was only for `DiffViewer` control but now (in this PR) this feature also supports `SideBySideDiffViewer` control and `InlineDiffViewer` control.

Plus, for context menu of header in `DiffViewer` control, I have also added the menu items to get and set the count of the context line directly when the unchanged sections are collapsed.

### Other updates

Fix following bugs brought in by old implementation to ignore unchanged lines. It re-organizes the input data but neglects some corner-cases. These codes have been removed/reverted here during I rewrite all the logic.

- In particular cases, the last line of old text may miss if that line is not empty but the new one is.
- Fails to run if the old text is empty. Sounds #70 also want to fix this issue but no need now.

And improve following items.

- Robustness optimization to avoid the exception thrown mentioned in #55.
- Optimize for identical texts.

**Limitations**
I didn't want to change the behavior of the benchmark so it still generates different examples during runtime. It is not a good pattern.

**How to run**
```
cd Perf.DiffPlex
dotnet run -c Release -- --filter *

It is dependent on that the diffs result `DiffPaneModel` computed from diff builder (such as `SideBySideDiffBuilder`) contains sub-pieces information.

Following is an example.

```xaml

```xaml
<diffplex:SideBySideDiffViewer x:Name=""DiffView"" />
```
```csharp

## Sample

Following is a sample of _Before_ vs _Now (in PR)_.

```csharp
// Before
var differ = new Differ();
var sideBySideBuilder = new SideBySideBuilder(differ);
var result = sideBySideBuilder.BuildDiffModel(oldText, newText);
```

```csharp
// Now (in PR)
var result = SideBySideBuilder.Diff(oldText, newText);
```

And of course, this pull request keeps the old style to allow advanced customization and usages.

## Breaking changes

Call the constructors `SideBySideDiffBuilder(IDiffer differ)` and `InlineDiffBuilder(IDiffer differ)` with an argument `null` is no longer throw an exception but use a default `Differ` instance to fill automatically instead.

```csharp
var diffBuilder = new SideBySideDiffBuilder(null);

// Before: It throws an exception.
// throw new ArgumentNullException(""differ"");

// Now (in PR): It is equivalent to following.
// var diffBuilder = new SideBySideDiffBuilder(Differ.Instance);
```

## Helper functions

- `SideBySideDiffBuilder.Diff`
- `InlineDiffBuilder.Diff`

## Singletons

- `Differ.Instance`
- `WordChunker.Instance`
- `LineEndingsPreservingChunker.Instance`
- `LineChunker.Instance`
- `CharacterChunker.Instance`

## WPF controls

A benefit of the helper functions and singletons is that I add a new WPF control `DiffViewer` which we can set the old text and new text directly instead of an instance of `SideBySideDiffModel` or `DiffPaneModel`.

```xaml
<diffplex:DiffViewer />

This PR should fix #47. I've made also a small refactoring by introducing `IChunker` interface which simplifies the `DIffer`. In my opinion, the `IDiffer` interface should be cut to:

```csharp
DiffResult CreateCustomDiffs(string oldText, string newText, bool ignoreWhiteSpace, bool ignoreCase, IChunker chunker);
```

and the rest of the overloads should be implemented as the extension methods. IMHO the name should be also simplified, let's say `CreateDiff`. Of course, these are breaking changes so I want to discuss it at first.

__EDIT__: I realized that this not enough to fix the problem because `InlineDiffBuilder` has hardcoded an invocation of specific overload from `IDiffer`. I needed to go further and I made another refactor by making an `IChunker` a constructor dependency for `DIffer` class. Now the `API` is much simpler and the extensibility and testability has been improved.

i have been doing tests with the WIT One Click Action Extension for 2 days now. 
This is my situation:

1. I have a Customized WIT for which I want to create automated Child Tasks when the State is changed from New to Active. 

2. This Customized WIT has 11 Rules created. these are basic, like autopopulating a field when this other conditions happens... See the image below to illustrate

3. I have tested to make the WIT One Click Action to work several ways:
   3.1 When the WIT has All the RULES enabled, the One Click Action Extention does NOT work.
   3.2 When the WIT has only 1 Rule enable, the One Click Action Extention does NOT work.
   3.3 When the WIT has NO RULES enabled, the once It works if the WIT has no other Rules associated.

4. These are screenshots of he One Click Action that I have set up

But there are some (for me) elementary issues. I ask you kindly if there is a roadmap or something similar to let me know if my issues will be resolved (and when).

- I was able to build a TFS 2018.2 Version, it seems to working fine - is there any plan to support this TFS version by default?
- As some other people demanded, we will be very happy if the default ""@CurrentIteration"" will work for the current workitem and for new created workitems, I think a OneClick action which is moving a workitem to the current iteration is very useful.
- Additionally, we need to setup conditions when a button will be shown (e.g. state of the wi = ""new"")

Command ""cirkit> comb_approx -b -m 2 -l 3"" results in ""[e] not implemented yet, use approximate_bdd program"". Uncommented line 17-31 in programs/CMakeList.txt to build approximate_bdd, but got the following error about the missing header file ""core/utils/program_options.hpp"", which wasn't available in any directory.

If it is not possible to do so through Revkit shell how how can I manipulate the codes to have just toffolis with targets more than 1?

When I was testing the command exact_mig I found the function :

 How should I calculate the cost ? Should I count the primitive M(0,D',C) two times or only one ?

7 gates, 12 input variables and 7 inverters.

For example, using another program I found the function: 
M(M(M'(A,B,1),C',0),M(M(1,C,D),M(A,B,D'),0),1)

Thank you for all your support on the package. I had a few questions. 

I'm trying to read a verilog description of an adder ""RCA_N16.v"" and the package seems to be having trouble with it. It is from the adder library associated with one of your papers. 

I'm writing it simply as read_verilog -a RCA_N16.v

Furthermore, in your paper ""BDD Minimization for Approximate Computing"" you develop a great methodology for automatically approximating circuits. I installed the package and I see this command. 

However, does the error metric calculation happen within the comb_approx command? As in, is it not a separate command? So if I wanted to run it on two circuits (an original and an approximated), I cannot do this with CirKit? 

This question is mostly about the error rate and average-case error metrics of your paper. 

Thanks once again for the great product. The file is attached for reference.

Please refer to the pic in the link. The third bit in inputs are the added ancillary input. Both two attempts guarantee that the function is correct when the added ancillary input=0,  the first attempt has a complete truth table. In the second attempt, I just guarantee the function is correct with a incomplete truth table. You see that the overhead of the two synthesized circuits  are very different though they use the same commands for synthesis. Why cant the second have the same overhead with the first one? Is it related with the synthesis methods or Is there any other synthesis methods in the tool kit that can achieve the less overhead for the second attempt?

This code change allows you to use your own stream when recording audio. The StartRecording function now accepts a stream object:
```
public async Task<Task<string>> StartRecording (Stream recordStream = null, bool writeHeaders = false)
```
If `recordStream` is `null` the old behavior is used where a file is written on the device. The writeHeaders flag can be used to write the WAV headers to the beginning of the stream.

Example usage:
```
var memoryStream = new MemoryStream();
var audioRecordTask = await recorder.StartRecording (memoryStream, true);
```
I added this change for my scenario where I don't want data to be stored on the device or use an internal memoryStream like #48.

When a user is too quiet, typically this results in recorder.GetAudioFilePath() being NULL.  This is frustrating for the users to have to repeat themselves and raise their voice.

When trying to use it we discovered an issue with .wav-file that was generated.
Android refused to play the file.
After some comparisons we found the header of generated files are incorrect.
While a some music players accept that, others like on Android do not.

The documentation we found shows that file length is calculated like this:
""Size of the overall file - 8 bytes, in bytes (32-bit integer). ""
So that means that line 48 of AudioFunctions should be:
`writer.Write (audioLength - 1);`

Then the data length is filelength minus the header.
And line 74:
`writer.Write (audioLength-44);`

To fix it, I simply cloned the project to create a local assembly and then made a Public Static Float volumeLevel variable in the AudioRecordingService.cs file and then updated the value of volumeLevel with the result of Calculate_Levels() every time its called in the AudioStream_OnBroadcast() event handler. Then from my personal app, I referenced the local DLL and was able to simply access the volumeLevel variable whenever I wanted to update the GUI to show the changing volume level.

Unfortunately, it's not working if you try to talk quietly. To record any sound or voice it has to be loud enough to be recorded.

We read the documentation of the Audio Recorder plugin for Xamarin and found that it supports concurrent streaming as per the documentation (It's also possible to get a stream to the recording audio data as it's being recorded). We also referred to the Bing Speech implementation provided in the documentation.

However, we are not able to achieve this functionality. Our observation was that when StartRecording is invoked, a wav file is being written to the GetAudioFilePath () - audiofilepath (ARS_recording.wav) and it always 0 bytes while being on a recording mode (via microphone). Only when StopRecording is invoked the stream writer internally flushes the bytes to the Wav file. Hence the below code recorder.GetAudioFileStream() does not streams any data during recording due to the fact that file ARS_recording.wav is always 0 bytes while recording.

// start recording audio
var audioRecordTask = await recorder.StartRecording ();

using (var stream = recorder.GetAudioFileStream ())
{
// this will begin sending the recording audio data as it continues to record
var simpleResult = await bingSpeechClient.SpeechToTextSimple (stream, recorder.AudioStreamDetails.SampleRate, audioRecordTask);
}

Please let us know if we are in the right path and the plugin will help us in solving the above mentioned usecase.

However, I am having an issue with iOS (UWP and Android are unaffected).

Almost every other time I execute StartRecording (the frequency is actually intermittent), the recording doesn't complete automatically.  I have tried both the Task and event-driven approaches.  When I manually stop recording by calling StopRecording, the result is always null in these instances.

As a rundown of the process that I can see:

* StartRecording is called
* IsRecording changes to true
* StopRecordingOnSilence has no effect (Task is not completed/AudioInputReceived does not fire)
* StopRecordingAfterTimeout has no effect (Task is not completed/AudioInputReceived does not fire)
* StopRecording is called
* IsRecording changes to false
* Task is completed/AudioInputReceived fires
* FilePath is null (always)

The next time I execute StartRecording everything might work perfectly, but I will quickly run into another occurrence of the problem.  As a reference, here are the settings I configure on the service:

StopRecordingOnSilence = true,
AudioSilenceTimeout = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(2),
SilenceThreshold = 0.1f,
StopRecordingAfterTimeout = true,
TotalAudioTimeout = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5),
PreferredSampleRate = 8000

I hope this makes sense.  Thanks.
