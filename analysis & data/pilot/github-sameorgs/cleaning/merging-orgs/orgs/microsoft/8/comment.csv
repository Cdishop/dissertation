I tried blanking the IIS Web Application Name to try to stop the duplicate ""?site="" from being in the computer name field, to no avail.  I get the Default Web Site and then another ?site=""Default Web Site/MyService"" at the end of it, and it all blows up.  I can make the deploy work by stealing the command line, editing it and removing the extra ?site= and leaving just ""Default Web Site"" as the ?site parameter, and running it from a VS command prompt.  So it clearly isn't a permissions issue.  It also seems to understand from somewhere what virtual to create, even though I blanked out the IIS Web Application Name variable.

Currently you have to update the [.nuspec](https://github.com/sayedihashimi/package-web/blob/master/src/Nuget/Package.nuspec) with the version number. The build script can leverage GitVersion to determine the version of the build. (i.e. 1.2.3 or 1.2.3.beta5) and automatically set the .nuspec.

Correct

> When it builds a non-master branch lets push the artifacts to the AppVeyor feed. When it builds the master branch lets push to the NuGet.org feed.

How about this, when we push to `release` branch (_yet to be created_) we release to nuget.org for all other branches we publish to AppVeyor feed? That way we can keep the latest and greatest in `master` and just merge to `release` when we want to go to nuget.org. If you feel strongly about your direction I'm ok with that as well. I just prefer to keep the latest code in the default branch in github.

I did some single step debugging of publish-interactive.ps1.  Looks like the bracketed variable name is emitted into the parameters file by on the build-side of package-web, not the part where the publish happened.  By the time publish-interactive.ps1 sees the {IIS Web Application Name}/App_Data, it is  getting this from the parameters file that was built.  So, I'm guessing the problem is a fail to do the subsitution at build time.

Side note:
In general, I think the biggest issue I'm having is how finicky the parameters are at publish time, So much so, that I am trying to think of a way to simplify things for the people doing the deployments.  The only two parameters I think my deployers should care about are the name of the config transform and the target server (without any Default Web Site/msdeploy.axd?....) stuff.  So just ""Sqa"" and ""MySqaServer"" with everything else 'just working', but because of how finicky the server name is, and the fact that all the other parameters, such as authentication, app_Data path name, etc  and even connection string (!) need to be specified, it seems that file based config is preferred, even though it's more error prone (what if you left the wrong config.ps1 file laying there from a previous deploy and then run the script -- deployed to the wrong place!)

I was thinking it would be better to simply support executing multiple transforms (including more than 2). In that case when the pub-int.ps1 is executed when prompted for transforms to execute you could enter something like the following.

```
    Transforms: release, qa, qa01

1. web.release.config
2. web.qa.config

I've published a pre-release on nuget.org. You can try it out by executing the following command in the package manage console.

```
    install-package PackageWeb -pre
```

It should install PackageWeb 1.1.11-beta2 (or higher).

When you run `Publish-Interactive.ps1` and are prompted for the transform to execute you can pass in multiple transforms by separating them with a semi-colon `;`. For example if you want to run the following transforms
1. web.release.config
2. web.sayedsample.config

You will enter `release;sayedsample`.

Please try it out and let me know what you think and if you run into any bugs.

When I was trying it I noticed that the TransformName value is not being saved into the publishconfiguration.ps1 file. I've opened issue #64 to track it for the same release as this one.

THAT is what I want to create.  However, if the ?site parameter to msdeploy.axd contains ""Default Web Site/MyService"" it will fail with the error described in top message.  If I were to tweak the command line and run it on a VS Command prompt such that the ?site parameter was just the ""Default Web Site"" it would work, and would even create the Application folder inside of it, because presumably the default full site name is buried in the web deploy package somewhere.

It's like a chicken and egg problem.  Msdeploy.axd won't connect to ""Default Web Site/MyService"" because it doesn't exist, but trying to get the magic combination of parameters in PackageWeb to CREATE the MyService folder under Default Web Site is just not happening. 

I am pretty sure it's not a rights issue, because I have been able to get this all to work from a VS command prompt.  But I _need_ those transforms for the different environments.  I'm sure I don't have to tell you how frustrating it is that Microsoft did not integrate publish-time transforms into their web deploy system -- since you're obviously filling a big hole here.

A hole in my understanding is this issue with msdeploy.  Is the ""Default Web Site/Myservice"" target specified in the package that's created during build?  I would have thought so, as it's requested in the Web Deploy publish dialog inside Visual Studio.  My sense is I need to ""CONNECT"" to ""Default Web Site"" but have web Deploy CREATE ""Default Web Site/MyService"" under it.  I just can see no way that ?site=""Default Web Site/MyService"" EVER works when MyService folder doesn't already exist in IIS.

If that doesn't work try this.

In VS create a new web deploy publish profile. The value for application name should be ""Default Web Site/MyService"". Instead of publishing just save the profile. That will create a .pubxml file under `Properties\PublishProfiles` add the following property.

```
<UseMSDeployExe>true</UseMSDeployExe>
```

In Tools->Options->Projects and Solutions->Build (_something like that_) set MSBuild verbosity in output window to `Detailed`.

Then publish in VS. The call to msdeploy.exe will be shown in the output window, just search for ""msdeploy.exe"".

Then publish with publish-interactive.ps1. Then paste the command line from VS that works here and the one from publish-interactive.ps1 which doesn't work.

The publish failed because of an untrusted certificate.  So, I copied the generated command line to a command prompt, added the missing -allowUntrusted as you'll see below and it published PERFECTLY, creating the appropriate MyService app under Default Web Site.  (I've 'dummied' confidential server/user/pw info below, but you get the idea)

C:\Temp\MyService>""C:\Program Files (x86)\IIS\Microsoft Web Deploy V3\msdeploy.exe"" -source:manifest='C:\Users\rmagruder\Source\Repos\MyService\Service\MyService\obj\Release\Package\MyService.SourceManifest.xml' -dest:auto,ComputerName=""https://SERVERNAME:8172/msdeploy.axd?site=Default%20Web%20Si

ckage\MyService.Publish.Parameters.xml"" -retryAttempts=2 -allowUntrusted -userAgent=""VS12.0:PublishDialog:WTE12.3.51016.0""

Then I copied the web deploy package output from the build to a temporary folder, substituted your latest Powershell script (my apologies for the ""<"" error, I right-clicked-saved your link in the message not realizing it was a link to a web page containing the file, rather than the file itself), and ran it with the following settings (again, dummied as necessary).  There were a few problems with this publish.  First, the 'default' connection string was blank, but that may be an error on my side.  I edited the ps1 file below to add that.

$settingsFromUser =@() 
$settingsFromUser += @{name=""IIS Web Application Name"";value='Default Web Site/MyService'}
$settingsFromUser += @{name=""Add write permission to App_Data Folder"";value='Default Web Site/MyService/App_Data'}
$settingsFromUser += @{name=""ThreeDEntities2-Web.config Connection String"";value='metadata=res://_/3DEntities.csdl|res://_/3DEntities.ssdl|res://*/3DEntities.msl;provider=Devart.Data.Oracle;provider connection string=""""User Id=USER;Password=PASSWORD;Server=SERVER;Direct=True;Sid=SERVER;Port=1523;Persist Security Info=True""""'}
$settingsFromUser += @{name=""Computer name"";value='SERVER'}
$settingsFromUser += @{name=""Username"";value='DOMAIN\USER'}
$settingsFromUser += @{name=""Password"";value='PW'}
$settingsFromUser += @{name=""Allow untrusted certificate"";value='true'}
$settingsFromUser += @{name=""whatif"";value='false'}

$settingsFromUser += @{name=""AuthType"";value='basic'}
$settingsFromUser += @{name=""ZipFile"";value='MyService.zip'}

This resulted in:

Error: The remote server returned an error: (401) Unauthorized.
Error count: 1.

This error makes no sense to me.  These credentials a) worked fine in the command prompt version above and published just fine, b) I double/triple checked the server.  This user _IS_ an admin on that box and all the 'stuff' seems to be installed and configured correctly.  

Should computer name be in the format https://server:8172/msdeploy.axd? Rather than just ""server""?
UPDATE:  Changed the parameter to:

$settingsFromUser += @{name=""Computer name"";value='https://SERVER:8172/msdeploy.axd?site=Default Web Site'} 

And it deployed!

So it seems as it would be nice if your script properly turned SERVERNAME into the format above, and prompted for both the target site and the IIS Web Application name without assuming they are one and the same.  Also, I am still seeing the {IIS Web Application Name}\App_Data in the prompts and I'm having to manually override with the actual IIS Web Application Name, so the powershell script isn't substituting the Web App Name variable for adding that folder/content/rights in interactive mode.  

I'll look at why the connection string dropped but that could be user error on my part.

I think we're getting there.  Ideally I'd like our build machine to build & deploy the package.zip to a deployment server, and have someone be able to just run the publish aiming at the target environment to publish to each respective environment, without having to worry too much about getting all these parameters exactly right.  Honestly the only thing she should have to change, ideally, is 'Dev', 'sqa', etc.  (the transform). and the target server name.

In general as long as your code works I'll take it in any shape.

If you're asking what I think would be ideal, then continue reading. When I created PackageWeb I was very new to PowerShell. Because of that the code isn't the prettiest and likely does some funny things.

Since then I've improved and I'd like to ensure that new code is good quality. For functions I'd like them to have
- `[cmdletbinding()]` attribute
- Some comments in the form of PS help (doesn't have to be much)
- Should support pipeline when it makes sense
- Should use `Write-Verbose` for diagnostic messages

For an example of how I write PowerShell these days see one of my other repos for ex: https://github.com/ligershark/psbuild/blob/master/src/psbuild.psm1.

If you are using a PublishConfiguraiton.ps1 you can just add the parameters to the end of the call to `Publish-Interactive.ps1` as follows.

```
.\Publish-Interactive.ps1 ""Computer name=waws-prod-bay-001.publish.azurewebsites.windows.net:443;Password=your-password-here'
```

If a parameter exists in both PublishConfiguraiton.ps1 as well as the command line, the command line value wins.

### How to use without a PublishConfiguration.ps1

If you want to pass in all the Web Deploy parameters, and not use a PublishConfiguration.ps1 file then you need to additionally pass in the `-NonInteractive` switch.

Currently the approach that PackageWeb uses is to extract out the .zip file
to a temp folder, perform the transforms in that location. After that
msdeploy.exe is called with that folder as the ArchiveDir.
Since we want to avoid expanding out the entire package I'll have to change
it to: identify transforms w/o extracting any files, extract selected
transform, perform the transform, copy the .zip file, update the web.config
in the .zip file and then kick off msdeploy.exe.

It may be a bit before I can get to that. I will need to block some
dedicated time just for this.

### Usage

To override the temp directory in the same PowerShell window that you will execute `publish-interactive.ps1` declare the following.
    $pkgWebOptions[""tempFolder""]=""C:\Temp\publish\temp""

If you are using `PublishConfiguration.ps1` you can set this value in that file as well.

### Files

Until the fix is released the .nupkg file is at https://dl.dropbox.com/u/40134810/PackageWeb/PackageWeb.1.1.7.nupkg

I added the following to the PublishConfiguration.ps1 (along with the other $settingsFromUser parameters):

By default the script will look for PublishConfiguration.ps1 but you can override that with the parameter publishConfigExpectedFilename.

In your case you can create different files, for example; publish.config.QA01.ps1, publish.config.QA02.ps1, etc. Then just pass in those files when calling publish-interactive.ps1.

maybe I am a bit naive, but I don't get the problem with gitlab being in a given path from the host:
- you know the path to gitlab as being the path part in gitlab configuration (in .gitspindle config file)
- you know the url path as the part on the right side of : in remote config

But unfortunately I could not get it to work with filters.  [The documentation](http://seveas.github.io/git-spindle/github.html#issues-and-pull-requests) says:

> `git hub issues [<repo>] [--parent] [<filter>...]`
>
> List all open issues. You can specify [filters](http://github3py.readthedocs.org/en/latest/repos.html#github3.repos.Repository.list_issues) to filter issues. When you specify `--parent`, list all open issues for the parent repository.

but the filters hyperlink is broken since there is no documentation for `github3.repos.Repository.list_issues`.  The closest I could find is `github3.repos.Repository.issues` which suggests that something like `assignee:aspiers` should be a valid filter, but when I try this outside any git repo, I get:

    $ git hub issues assignee:aspiers
    Repository assignee:aspiers could not be found

I planned to do this after 1.0.0 was out of alpha status, exactly because maintaining compatibility with 0.9 will be impossible. I'm more than happy to see this work already being done.

I've briefly glanced at the changes and the only thing that made me go hmm was the base64 things, so I'll need to look at that in more detail. Will do a proper review and merge later.

Regarding the base64 thing, I was missing the `.decoded` attribute in there. However, why did you get the content directly from the url in `git hub cat` instead of just using `Content.decoded`? 

Right now I left it using `Content.decoded`, but I realized I can revert it back to almost the way it were if there is a reason for it. It turns out only the `_session` attribute was renamed.

On Fedora (which I run) `pip` wants to install directly into /usr which obviously is root territory so it won't work even though I'm in the wheel group (and /usr/local is root:root as well). 

So my answer would be to write something like:

```
To install the latest released version on other systems, assuming python and
pip are installed do one of the below:

Either make a user install: 

    pip install --user git-spindle

or if you have administrator rights and want to make git-spindle available for other users:

    sudo pip install git-spindle
```

I don't have an OSX system to test with so I have no idea if the above will work there.

If I'm understanding the docs correctly, `git-spindle` should be recognizing the repository based on the remote url configured for it for commands executed within a repository. However, it seems to be using my username in place of the group assigned to the repository. For example:

```
kflorence:~/dev/mosaic/business (test)$ git remote -v
origin  git@gitlab.intranet.solarmosaic.com:mosaic/business.git (fetch)
origin  git@gitlab.intranet.solarmosaic.com:mosaic/business.git (push)
kflorence:~/dev/mosaic/business (test)$ git lab log
Repository kflorence/business could not be found on GitLab
```

Above you can see I'm in the `business` repository which is assigned to the `mosaic` group, but it is looking for the repository with my username instead. Do I need to setup an account for ""mosaic"" for it to recognize this properly?

Tested on py2.7, but didn;t work as it is unable to launch the editor. Also, there seems to be no cmdline option to provide the message directly.

Here's what happened:

Try 1 - In .gitconfig, I had set `editor = wordpad`. This works normally with git, but here it couldn't start the application.
Here's the traceback:

```

    startupinfo)

```

Try 2 - `editor = wordpad.exe` because I thought it is being run as a program, and not shell command
Again, here's the error:

```

    raise KeyError(""Command '%s' not found"" % name)
KeyError: ""Command 'wordpad.exe' not found""
```

Try 3 - I removed the editor line, to let it launch the default one. But this time a windows error appeared saying app should be run as non-elevated user, which I see is a issue with Gitpad itself and also happens when I use git commit without editor set. Will resolve it separately.

But what to do if you have a `editor = something` set?

I finally managed to get it working, by including the wordpad path to env. I think this was very much a corner case as apparently `cmd` on windows doesnt know the path of wordpad automatically, which is where `shell=true` redirects, but `powershell` knows it automatically even when it is not in the env path.

**So, not at all a mistake from `git-spindle`. It is fixed.** :smiley:

**But I think there is another interesting thing too:**

I saw that `_getitem` tries all env path and also append `.exe` to search for the file on Windows, but when I used just `editor=wordpad` i.e. without the `.exe`, it never actually reached that function. First `_call_` tries to resolve it via popen and just fails, so without `.exe` it will probably never actually reach that `.exe` adding stuff.

So for Fedora 21 at least ~/.local/share/bash-completion/completions/ is actually loaded (without adding extra stuff to my bashrc).

It seems like `/etc/bash_completion.d/` is fairly widely supported for just autoloading a bunch of scripts (without the auto-loading stuff that happens under `/usr/share/bash-completion/completions/`).

I'm not very familiar with python and setup.py, but if it's possible my suggestion is to install into `/etc/bash_completion.d/` when doing a system install and under ~/.config/bash_completion.d/ on a `--user` install. And then in the docs say that you need to add something like the below to your .bashrc.

```
for comp in ${HOME}/.config/bash_completion.d/ /* ; do
    if [ -f ""${comp}"" ] ; then
        . $comp
    fi
done
```

Either that or just install it _somewhere_ and say that people need to symlink it to whatever directory they use for their completion scripts.

That said, neither git nor gitk themselves seem to care either, at least from reading the commits I've linked. If the environment variable is empty, nothing breaks – it'll use the spec-defined default, `~/.config/git/`. (That's the case on most Linux systems too.)

On Windows (with Cygwin) and FooBSDs, many users likely already have programs using `~/.config/` too. (Dotfiles aren't a Windows thing anyway. It would be ideal to use AppData I guess.)

On OS X, the new path is just a little bit unusual. (Unfortunately I don't know what paths _are_ usual...)
- I could add a whitelist or blacklist for `os.name == ""posix""` or similar.
- I could swap the order so that `~/.gitspindle` remains the default in new installations, with `~/.config/git/spindle` as the fallback path.
- I could make it use `%APPDATA%` on Windows, and [something] on OS X.
- I don't want to withdraw the patch unless it's explicitly rejected. (Even though more and more programs migrate to ~/.config and ~/.cache, I still have 5× ~/.dotfiles than regular files, and I'd like to clean them up.)

https://github.com/seveas/python-hpilo/blob/8880f692d347e1ac7d0b0de993325d70b69c38aa/hpilo.py#L403

It's problematic on e.g. `Python 3.9.0` on MacOS, where using the above code results in this ssl.SSLError: `('No cipher can be selected.',)`, but changing that line the following way (to drop ""RC4-SHA"") makes it work again:
```diff
-self.ssl_context.set_ciphers(""RC4-SHA:"" + ssl._DEFAULT_CIPHERS)
+self.ssl_context.set_ciphers(ssl._DEFAULT_CIPHERS)
```

I don't fully understand why Python/SSL simply won't ignore this cipher that it maybe doesn't support in that version. [Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ssl.html#ssl.SSLContext.set_ciphers) states:
> If no cipher can be selected (because compile-time options or other configuration forbids use of all the specified ciphers), an SSLError will be raised.

`ssl._DEFAULT_CIPHERS` in this version of OpenSSL evaluates to `DEFAULT:!aNULL:!eNULL:!MD5:!3DES:!DES:!RC4:!IDEA:!SEED:!aDSS:!SRP:!PSK`.

However, digging into the definition of [CIPHER LIST FORMAT (v1.1.0)](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.0/man1/ciphers.html), I see a note about the `DEFAULT` cipher group alias:
> DEFAULT
The default cipher list. This is determined at compile time and is normally ALL:!COMPLEMENTOFDEFAULT:!eNULL. **When used, this must be the first cipherstring specified**.

For OpenSSL v1.1.1, [it says](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man1/ciphers.html):
> The cipher list can be prefixed with the DEFAULT keyword...

Indeed, when moving the ""RC4-SHA"" to the end to let ""DEFAULT"" be first, there is no ssl.SSLError exception thrown:
```diff
-self.ssl_context.set_ciphers(""RC4-SHA:"" + ssl._DEFAULT_CIPHERS)
+self.ssl_context.set_ciphers(ssl._DEFAULT_CIPHERS + "":RC4-SHA"")
```

I can't tell whether RC4-SHA will actually work as I don't have iLO that supports it and likely this version of Python/OpenSSL would not, but I believe is a generally more compatible way of expressing the original intention of this code.

It's not perfect, but I wanted you to get a chance to test, etc and I'll see if I can fix any issues. Currently, the one thing I have a problem with is more of an ILO2 issue than anything.

That is a valid point which is outside of the scope of this issue but also needs to be handled. There is one answer with a few implementations. Digital signatures. Linux distros do this quite well for many years now. PIP allows to upload signatures but not to check them. Git has good support for it. In your case, as you download the file on runtime, you would need to check the signature each time. GnuPG and OpenSSL come to mind.

> the firmware is already signed and the iLO won't accept anything that's corrupt.

Do you have details on that signature or is it just a checksum you can calculate yourself? Or perhaps some home-brown crypto which will break if you look at it (example [mec-tools](https://github.com/eigenmatt/mec-tools))?

Not necessarily. Your Python module is in Debian (https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=hpilo). When you now harden the down-streaming path too, for example, Debian by implementing #184 you are pretty far with mitigating the bootstrapping problem.

Having dealt with a few firmware formats and looking into reversing and patching one of them ([thinkpad-ec](https://github.com/hamishcoleman/thinkpad-ec/)) I have my doubts for every security feature which can not be reviewed (free access to the source code and build chain) so I would still recommend to do this additionally in python-hpilo. Also, we have no idea how good HPE is with keeping their private keys private. Their website setup does not look too well done at some parts. There is a reason why https://github.com/rootkovska/codehash.db exists. Lets bump our thread model up once more: Targeted attacks.

At least the HPE docs have some details on this:

> Authorized firmware updates – iLO firmware images are digitally signed with a 2048-bit
 private key. The boot block checks the digital signature every time iLO comes out of reset.
iLO checks the digital signature before allowing a firmware update to proceed. Remote
flashing requires login authentication and authorization, including optional two-factor
authentication.
> 
> Image Validation
> The entire image is hashed with SHA256 and signed using Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s RSA
2048-bit private key. This signature block is pre-pended to the firmware binary image.
> 
> Boot-Time Integrity Check
> At boot time, each piece has its signature validated before it is allowed to execute. Subsequent
pieces are checked by the previous ones until iLO is fully booted.

And as you can notice, the first commands are very similar as the XML you generated `FACTORY_DEFAULTS` and `LICENSE` in their own `RIB_INFO` and this works.

I know HP XML parser is a bit capricious maybe I hit a ILO bug or something.

I have some experience dealing with iLO scripting.  Basically, you are executing two commands in one XML script that you need to put in two separate XML scripts:

The FACTORY_DEFAULTS tag causes iLO to erase its NVRAM and schedule a reboot.  Now, here is the catch:  The iLO reboot starts as soon as the XML parser sees the closing RIB_INFO tag.   Anything you add after that closing RIB_INFO tag may not execute properly because, even though the XML parser keeps executing your script, iLO behind the scenes is already preparing itself to go for a reboot and sometimes iLO reboots really quick.    

Because of this behavior, I've seen cases where some iLO settings could get corrupted.  I had this problem few years ago and I contacted HP support.  They told me to separate the XML scripts,or change the order of Tags in order to leave the one that triggers the iLO reboot to the end.

These scripts below will always work.  But, you need to wait until iLO comes back from reboot which could take ~1 minute.

I know your script used to work but, it doesn't anymore.  I had the same problem few years ago when a couple of my iLOs would end up with corrupted SNMP settings.  
My script had multiple RIB_INFO sections just like your script and, since the first section of my script was making changes to iLO network settings (MOD_NETWORK_SETTINGS), all my iLOs were  rebooting at the end of the first RIB_INFO section.  
The result was a totally unpredictable behavior where some of my iLOs were getting correct SNMP settings while others were not. My iLOs were all at the same firmware level but, on different server models. Yet, they behaved differently. It was a disaster.

HP support told me to never add extra RIBCL sections after one that is known to trigger an iLO reboot. Any MOD_NETWORK_SETTINGS change will cause iLO to reboot so, will FACTORY_DEFAULTS by the way.  Making the suggested changes to my script solved my problems for good.

Basically, HP support told me that if you see this response coming from iLO:

```
<?xml version=""1.0""?>
<RIBCL VERSION=""2.23"">
<RESPONSE
    STATUS=""0x0000""
    MESSAGE='No error'
     />
<INFORM>Integrated Lights-Out will reset at the end of the script.</INFORM>
</RIBCL>
```

Any RIBCL section you see executing after this message is not guaranteed to succeed because, iLO is in the process of shutting down. In other words, iLO has began closing its doors and windows and, turning off the lights one by one in order to go for a reboot.

Could you also please move the -s/-ssl option to just below the -o option and add the new options/arguments to the documentation?

And finally, there's [code to fall back to sslv3](https://github.com/vpiserchia/python-hpilo/blob/TLSv1_2/hpilo.py#L401) if tlsv1 is unsupported. Should that fallback be disabled if an explicit ssl_version was specified?

and for encode you can register error handlers or use 'replace' as a
error strategy, which i assume uses the U+FFFD, ‘REPLACEMENT
CHARACTER’ ie � - which should be ok.

It feels like your patch is doing work that is already handled nicely
by string.encode()
And i think it would be preferable to use that =)

Yes, i know it's wrong, it did however solve my problem :)

What I'm saying is that the infrastructure for what you did already exists
in string.encode - no point in duplicating code ;)

Thanks for contributing back! I haven't actually used hpilo_ca sign yet
with an ilo4 so I'm curious to see what the problems are.

To generate a patch for uncommitted changes: git diff
To generate a patch for changes you already committed: git format-patch origin/master

That would be a nice idea. I don't generally visit iLO's this way, but
can see that it would help in other use-cases. It would require a new
certificate when the IP address changes though, but that's not a big
deal.

There's also the problem that the iLO generates the CSR, so we have to
mangle it to include the subjectAltName (and hope the iLO actually
supports this.

I was using the 2.9 release but the code hasn't changed much, so the 
patch may apply. One thing to note is that when requesting a CSR it can 
take the iLO about 12 mins to prepare one. I've only tried this with iLO 4.

With blade enclosures the on-board administrator is the easiest way to 
go as all 16 blades are accessible from one interface. From there we can 
click onto the individual iLOs and their remote consoles.

This does work, I used hpilo_cli to generate the CSR, It seems that the 
iLO need the FQDN of the host to accept the certificate and any change 
to the network settings causes the certificate to reset to the default 
useless one. The CSR generated by the iLO includes a subjectAltName for 
the FQDN and the host name but not the IP address. So I have to add one 
when signing the request. I wasn't sure if this was possible with 
openssl but found the answer that it is possible (from TinyCA). I 
manually signed the certificate and imported it with the import 
certificate command. It worked and no more untrusted certificate.

BTW I think that HP have broken their RIBCL commands with iLO4 version 
2.10 as they now return an error saying ""Error writing xml_header"", I've 
a case with HP about this error message.

Kind regards

Similarly, `get_fw_version` returns a single dict, whether it's run  as part of a delayed call or not. `call_delayed` does not (and should not) change the return type of any of the called function. If it does, that is a bug.

Here's an example from the command line, the `+` makes it use `call_delayed`.:

```
$ hpilo_cli 10.1.2.3 get_fw_version

Anyway, I'm afraid the bug is not in python-hpilo, but in your expectations. AHS, and thus GET_AHS_STATUS is only supported in iLO 4. The fact that the iLO returns 'Syntax error' is a [known issue](http://seveas.github.io/python-hpilo/troubleshooting.html#syntax-error-line-0) which is annoying but impossible to fix in python-hpilo.

isnt it possible to catch all this syntax error crap in a special exception e.g. IloSyntaxError? Maybe you could also check if the command is valid for the current iLO version? A List with iLO version and their supported set of commands would be great and a timesaver. Did you thought about that?

- It requires me to maintain that list

- There may be actual genuine syntax errors due to bugs

So, so far I've not been in favor of that, and instead warned about it in the documentation.

Thanks that was very helpful.  I have it working now.  I had to set the

Finally, how do I provide output of the command in the way you want it?

I have been referring to
http://bizsupport2.austin.hp.com/bc/docs/support/SupportManual/c02774508/c02774508.pdf
as
an XML reference.

It's the first time I've attempted to produce any patches for other people
code (and my first time with python and git). My apologies if you don't
find what I have written immediately useful, I hope that at least
even manually merging some of the changes would be helpful to you. Would
you be willing to give me any more specific examples of what you find
sloppy. If I find time to make any further changes to the code I would like
to try and provide them in a form that you find acceptable for merging in.

Thanks
James

It made it hard to figure out if it was my changes or something else so I decided to fix the fails separately.

Here is a longer description of the changes I made. Note that there were many ways to prevent the fails. Let me know if you would have preferred another approach.

**LearnerPrediction and Prediction fails**: This was mainly caused by the fact that the test datasets are quite small. Since the train/test samples are selected randomly we were sometimes _unlucky_ and the accuracy was not satisfying. Considering that by using a 0.8 ratio of train vs test samples on a 14 samples dataset, this leaves only 3 test samples. The current minimum accuracy was 0.75 which would not allow even one fail. I reduced this to 0.66 and increased the _repeat_ from 10 to 100.
Another recurring fail was that the _best_ model couldn't always predict the hardcoded sample for Iris even when the model accuracy was high. Looking at the [scatterplot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set#/media/File:Iris_dataset_scatterplot.svg) for Iris I noticed that SepalLength and SepalWidth were a little bit off from what we would expect of Iris-Setosa so I adjusted these values.

**Index out of range exception**: The GenerateModel() method in Learner.cs was extracting the potential labels from the test set. In a context of low test samples it often happened that the test set didn't even include all the trained labels. When the model would (_wrongfully_) predict a label which was not in the test set it would lead to an invalid descriptor label index. I added a parameter to prevent updating the labels list. Another way to repair this could have been to clone the descriptor from the train set but I found no clone method for Descriptor.

Note that some numl tests are still failing but they are unrelated to my changes. I might give them a look once I fixed NaiveBayesGenerator...",NA,https://api.github.com/repos/sethjuarez/numl/issues/79/comments,https://github.com/sethjuarez/numl/pull/79#issuecomment-338912029,https://api.github.com/repos/sethjuarez/numl/issues/79

The GRU model is still being refined and further developed, so hold off using it for now.  When ready, it'll have the same usage as the other models in the library - which is [describing the data](http://numl.net/getting-started/descriptors.html) and fitting a model to it.  The sliding window is automagically handled by the internal state representation of the GRU thus predicting on a new sample acts as a sliding window and updates the state for future predictions.

A GRU representation could look like this (untested):

    public class SensorReading
    {
	public DateTime Date { get; set; }
	public double Value { get; set; }

	public SensorReading Next(IModel timeseriesModel)
	{
		return timeseriesModel.Predict(this);
	}
    }

    public void Main()
    {
	DateTime now = DateTime.Now;
	var dataset = new {
		new SensorReading { Date = now, Value = 1 },
		new SensorReading { Date = now.AddMinutes(1), Value = 2 },
		new SensorReading { Date = now.AddMinutes(2), Value = 3 },
		new SensorReading { Date = now.AddMinutes(3), Value = 4 },
	};
	
	var descriptor = Descriptor.For<SensorReading>()
				   .WithDateTime(i => i.Date, DatePortion.Time)
				   .Learn(i => i.Value);

	IModel timeseries = new GatedRecurrentGenerator()

It looks like your label attribute is an Int32 - would that be right?

Can you try converting the model object to a Vector form using the instantiated Descriptor object - see Descriptor.Convert(object item, bool withLabel).  Pass in false for the withLabel property.  Then pass the double array to the model Predict method and reply back here with the predicted output (raw value) from the model.

My guess is that one of the features of this specific test item is causing an issue.  Can you check the features against the ones used at training time?

Also can you tell us which build you're using?

`Discrete` is defined as a property on the `Property` class:

```
public bool Discrete { get; set; }
```

This works for both normal features/properties as well as enumerable ones, because enumerable properties are all of the same type. But if we have a complex type with discrete and non-discrete values, then how would this be resolved?

As far as I can tell, `Discrete` is only used for logic flow in two places (currently in portable):
[line 225 in DecisionTreeGenerator.cs](https://github.com/sethjuarez/numl/blob/portable/numl/Supervised/DecisionTree/DecisionTreeGenerator.cs) and [line 35 in NaiveBayesGenerator.cs](https://github.com/sethjuarez/numl/blob/portable/numl/Supervised/NaiveBayes/NaiveBayesGenerator.cs). 

I would think the `NaiveBayesGenerator` can be ignored I would think, because it is a label and I wouldn't think labels should be complex types (though perhaps I'm wrong?).

But with the `DecisionTreeGenerator` (and possibly other future algorithms), we definitely have logic based on this. 

One possible change to address this could be changing the `Discrete` from a bool property to a `IsDiscrete(int i)` virtual method, and maybe giving it a default value to show its usual use: `IsDiscrete(int i = 0)`. This would also need changes in the serialization aspects as well I think. 

Thoughts?

Under this assumption there were two categories of numbers (in my original opinion): 
1. Discrete - binary and small subset of integers 
2. Everything else

This worked well under the above mentioned assumption - not so sure when there is a one-to-many correspondence between a property and the generated numbers.

An additional assertion - the descriptor was never intended to be used to flatten object graphs into vectors. My hope was that there would first be a projection onto a flattened structure that would subsequently be described by the descriptor. I initially went down this path but quickly realized I would be re-implementing a lot of what already existed in AutoMapper. This is why I put work into the descriptor working even with anonymous types (it does). You could theoretically flatten into an anonymous type and couple it with a weak descriptor.

What do you think?

As for your additional assertion, it has been my understanding that the descriptor is the OOP-to-math bridge, enabling the wrapping/consumption/simplification of the ML complexities in object terms (the main reason I chose numl in the first place). As such, I personally like the object graph flattening being encapsulated in the descriptor and I appreciate your distinctions of strong/weak descriptors in the [comments of your blog](http://sethjuarez.com/2013/04/08/descriptors-in-numl/).  So I think that was a good decision also.

And using those terms, this issue is simply an implementation detail of a strong descriptor, and I think it can be done as you mentioned by creating custom `Property` and `Attribute` classes (which is what I've done so far). I might just have to tweak the `Discrete` property, possibly by making it a virtual property with (obviously) its current implementation as the base implementation. This would avoid a breaking change and also allow the mapping process to handle the one-to-many relationship of properties to matrix numbers. If I can, then it's conceivable I could do an attribute as is mentioned by @bdschrisk to provide some kind of syntactic sugar for this.

I don't know for sure though, I just wanted to get your thoughts on this before going ahead. I'll go ahead and try to implement this `Discrete` tweak and see how it looks. Though I haven't dug into your process of math mapping back to the descriptor (label) just yet, it _should_ work (famous last words)...I've been meaning to get some kind of T-shirt and/or coffee mug made:

After debugging the code in **_Learner.cs**_ in the `private static LearningModel GenerateModel(IGenerator generator, Matrix x, Vector y, IEnumerable<object> examples, double trainingPct, int total)` method I found out that when it was attempting to validate the model, I would get a NaN value from the call to **_model.Predict(features);**_.

```
                // make prediction
                var features = descriptor.Convert(o, false).ToVector();

                var p = model.Predict(features);
                var pred = descriptor.Label.Convert(p);
```

The NaN value being passed into the Convert method is causing the IndexOutOfRange exception.

In the **_StringProperty.cs**_ file in the Convert method, the AsEnum is set to true and then it looks for the value in the dictionary and croaks.

``` csharp
            if (AsEnum)
                return Dictionary[(int)val];
            else
                return val.ToString();

I must be doing something horribly wrong. I'm trying to use naive bayes to categorize some data based on input via a spreadsheet. The code runs, but it seems to give me the same category regardless of my input. I've appended some sample code below (gloss over the helper call that reads Excel; that just takes the sheet & converts to a .net dataset). Also, I'm limiting the training data to the first 100 rows. Any more than that and the program gets an out of memory exception!

So I have two questions:
- how to get a meaningful prediction/classification?
- how to load much larger training dataset without memory overflow?

In this case the test reflected V2's as 0 - 999.

I personally like the proposed by @kingsfleet way to calculate fake progress (see below) but don't add it to the plugin due to the following reasons 
1. Be consistent with native logic which does no report calculated progress
2. Allow devs to use any custom calculation for progress based on bytesReceived/totalBytesToReceive values

```
var fakeProgress = 1;

... in progress handler

if (progress < 0 || progress > 100)
{
    fakeProgress = fakeProgress * 0.99;
    progress = Math.round(100 * (1-fakeProgress));

```
NSURL *targetURL = [NSURL URLWithString:_targetFile];

[fileManager removeItemAtPath:targetURL.path error: nil];
[fileManager createFileAtPath:targetURL.path contents:[fileManager contentsAtPath:[location path]] attributes:nil];

I want to choose the header(s) Outlook should show. In my case there are special headers my mail gateway adds.

Late last night I had to reboot for an unrelated reason and (not saying it’s necessarily because of this) since then, it shows up in both instances of outlook. On top is larry@larryseltzer.com<mailto:larry@larryseltzer.com>, on the bottom is larry.seltzer@hpe.com<mailto:larry.seltzer@hpe.com>.

[cid:image001.png@01D6C7B1.E2CBBC70]

On the other hand, there are other add-ins on one and not the other. I’ve always found management of this stuff in Outlook confusing. For instance, I would like to uninstall the Send to Slack thing, but I don’t see it anywhere in any Outlook setting.

So consider the support contact closed, it’s obviously not anything wrong with MHA. But is there a way to get a big picture on all these Outlook add-ins?

Thank you

Is the same true for other add-ins? MHA doesn't have any role in determining when the icon is active - that happens on Outlook's end.

Yes - the contents of the X-Forefront-Antispam-Report header are the source for that section, so I included them verbatim as the source header. Are you saying that's wrong? Why do you call out that the header value start with CIP? Is that not correct?

> Is this expected new design change?

Not sure how to answer this. I mean - I wrote the code, so I guess I expected to do it? But if you're saying something is wrong about it I'd like to understand the issue before I commit to saying it's the expected design.

> Any reasons to do this?

I realized there were fields in the antispam reports that weren't getting parsed out. Some of them were documented, some weren't. The documented ones get parsed out and the remaining ones are unknown fields. In case anything about the parsing is wrong, I also show the original header untouched.

> Shouldn't be kept as ""X-Forefront-Antispam-Report"" in ""Other headers""?

After the work I did on the antispam report parsing, the extra copy down in other headers became redundant, so I removed it. I did the same with the received headers, to, from, subject etc that all appear in their own sections. None of them belong in Other so I removed them.

Places which log 9020:
1. _loadDictionaryRequest

I use both of the above, but we're getting this error from an EWS request, which is the third place this is logged:
3. handleResponse - when wasProxySuccessful is false.

I would first like to just do something simple, uninstall and reinstall … experience proves that fixes 90% of issues … before digging into the logs. Can you please explain to me how to uninstall the add-in? I do not see it listed in add-ins or in control panel/programs. I know I didn’t install it doing anything on our exchange server so it is all local. Also, once uninstalled, do you have a link directly to where I can get the code to reinstall? When I tried to find that it took me to where I could install for an office 365 implementation, but not a client/server based install with on-prem Exchange and client office 2016.

This red shopping bag icon with Store and Add-ins written underneath it is where you manage this kind of add-in.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6773183/38887646-69e3310e-4247-11e8-9dba-793720b3e85e.png)
The whole experience is managed through the Store and OWA/Exchange admin portal  and I have no control over it. If you do manage to remove the add-in, you should be able to locate it again in the store, or else here's the [direct link](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/office/WA104005406?src=office&corrid=eeaf65c8-bf39-4ab2-9096-33bbe1672384&omexanonuid=f7cbeeba-7e18-4118-b5cc-e6ca4d266254).

I can tell you that this is NOT an installation problem and it will NOT be resolved by uninstalling and reinstalling, because there's nothing actually ""installed"" here in the first place. All you're doing in the store is opting in to a manifest which tells Outlook what URL to go to to load the web page that is MHA. Every time you open the add-in a new copy of the code is fetched from my server.

>in none of them do I see the fix

I don't think I suggested any of them had ""the fix"" in them. Just that they were other people reporting the same issue in their code, which is useful information in trying to work out the cause of a problem. I strongly suspect the problem here is config on your end, which is why I wanted you to go through [Andrei's blog](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/emeamsgdev/2014/09/19/troubleshooting-exchange-2013-mail-apps-executeewsproxy-calls/) to see if you could narrow down where the problem is.",NA,https://api.github.com/repos/stephenegriffin/MHA/issues/80/comments,https://github.com/stephenegriffin/MHA/issues/80#issuecomment-382089743,https://api.github.com/repos/stephenegriffin/MHA/issues/80

When I try to do access it from the Store, it asks for my Office account, then tries to find an associated O365 account, which it never will since I do not have one. I am not sure if this is a Microsoft thing or not; however, from my perspective it is just a problem that I need to remove any way I can. Thank you though for your attempt to help me. Bummer though it didn’t work as I was considering having it installed on all 500 PCs under my purview as a tool to detect and fight spam.

Maybe you installed MHA via your [Exchange Admin Center](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj150562(v=exchg.160).aspx), perhaps even using a manifest file. 

Here are the steps from the front page of this GitHub on managing an add-in via the EAC. You should be able to reverse them:
- Go to the Exchange Admin Center.
- Click on the Organization tab
- From there, select the add-ins tab
- Click the Plus icon/Add from the Office Store
- A new page will load for the store
- Search for ""Message Header Analyzer""
- Choose MHA in the results
- Click Add
- Confirm by clicking Yes
- Back in the Exchange Admin Center, refresh the list of add-ins
- You can now edit who the add-in is available for

This was verified over the last hour when I uninstalled Office and then reinstalled. Once done, MHA was gone. I did follow your instructions below just to further verify if there was a footprint of any kind in Exchange and it was nowhere to be found. I wish I could tell you how I installed it locally only but it’s been a while and I just can’t remember.

In any event, I appreciate your support and response. Too often I work with vendors/software developers who just do not understand support is part of the equation when developing software … it doesn’t just end with a release.

Have a great day,

We found the solution.  If you are doing EWS filtering as we are you need to include ""Mozilla/*"" in the list.  I basically kicked off fiddler and attempted to use MHA and noticed that the user agent was ""Mozilla/..."".

Outlook 2016 MSI uses an older version of outlook-win32-16.00.js than Outlook 2016 C2R. In the older version of this file, there is some code to check that a callback function is indeed a function. This code looks like this:
```
            if(Function.isInstanceOfType(args[0]))
                callback = args[0];
```
However, this returns false for our callback function. Over in C2R, this same check now looks like this:
```
            if($h.CommonParameters._argIsFunction$p(args[0]))
                callback = args[0];
```
Where **argIsFunction** is defined like so:
```
    $h.CommonParameters._argIsFunction$p = function(arg)
    {
        return typeof arg === ""function""
    };
```

So in 2016 MSI, **makeEwsRequestAsync** thinks we didn't pass a callback, but in 2016 C2R, it correctly concludes we did.

Action plan: Report this back to Office dev, and also continue to hack to see if I can force something past the isInstanceOfType check.

That's an old error message which I've since updated. I've also in the meantime updated my caching headers to force reloads.

So - what's going on:
1 - Outlook for iOS put out an update which broke one of the libraries I used.
2 - I coded a workaround and shipped it
3 - Since my old pages had no caching headers, Outlook for iOS isn't looking for the updated pages.

One thing which I know will fix this is to uninstall Outlook for iOS and reinstall. That will force it to download MHA again and get the new files (with proper cache headers so this shouldn't happen again). If anyone finds a less drastic workaround please speak up and thank you!

Today I cannot see MessageHeaderAnalyzer anywhere in my desktop Outlook 2016 (Windows) client. I tried to add it to the buttons in the ribbon, but I cannot see any trace of MHA in my Outlook. Maybe I’m not looking for the right thing or in the right place. Other add-ins like Unsubscribe, Bing Maps and Action items still shows up for all my mailboxes in my Outlook client.

 

If I now look in OWA I can see a new little blue MHA-button which shows me headers with a new layout. The gray line with MessageHeaderAnalyzer that was previously on top of the messages is no longer to be seen.

 

I have installed it for all my mailboxes that I can log into, but I don’t see how I can manage addons for shared mailboxes. It also don’t show up in OWA if I open another mailbox than the one that I am logged in as, even though if both my own and the other mailbox has MHA installed.

I don't get to control where it shows up, but I did just update it today to support command buttons in the ribbon. Does that allow it to now work in the other mailboxes?

After changing between some folders I did not see it again before removing the addin and adding it again from the store.

First I only saw it for my primary account and not any other mailboxes. After just clicking around a bit in Outlook it showed up in the other mailboxes as well.

I've tried restarting Outlook to reproduce the problem and the MHA button was gone again, and may suddenly appear, and may suddenly go away again, all in just a few minutes after starting Outlook. While writing the previous sentence I could not see the button. After switching back to Outlook the button was there again, but only for two out of three mailboxes. And now, two seconds after, I cannot see the button in any of the mailboxes, and even while clicking around for several minutes I still don't see it.

I tried again to restart Outlook and the icon appeared after a few seconds, only to disappear again after changing folders and I currently see it in one of my secondary mailboxes, but not the others. A few seconds later I now see it on both my secondary mailboxes, but not my primary. It has now been like this for several minutes.

Sorry for not giving any better explanation of the problem, but it seems too variable or random for me to describe it any better, but something is clearly not working as intended here.

Please tell if there is anything I can do to help resolve this issue.

It's not my machine, but belongs to a friend & I'm trying to help. I helped her search, but I couldn't find them either. She has said she is certain that she did not delete the folders. And that seems likely to me because it was 15-20 folders missing, but 3 remain! 

After failing in my search, I contacted M'soft's Exchange support (I have an account). The tech support guy mentioned the word ""corrupted"" referring I think to the database for mail. He was very nice, but in the end, he said they (MS Tech Support) couldn't ""recover"" the missing/lost/misplaced/hidden folders without `mfcmapi`, and that meant she had to have a Windows machine. Neither of us use Windows any longer, so this is a bit of a roadblock at the moment.

Although the final message "" File converted successfully."" appeared - in fact no file appears in the folder.

Compared to successfull example (with no special characters in filename), Nothing appears after Input File: (marked red)
Apparently, because the special character in that example was on the first place. I have then tested with other filename, where the special character appears at the end or in the middle:
it turned out, the input filename is processed correctly until special character:

I have tried to change codepage before: chcp 1252 and 65001 (UTF-8), but still no luck.




Another approach would be to grab the messages directly from the inbox, convert them and store on local folder. (Similar as with MFCMAPI, where I first Logon with ""Outlook"" Profile, chose the inbox/pst opened in Outlook, and take the right subfolder within the mailbox). 
But I didn't figured out the right syntax for the options.
Using `MrMAPI -Contents -Profile Outlook -Folder 13 -Ms` does export all messages from Inbox of default store. Was unlucky to specify subfolder of another store.",NA,https://api.github.com/repos/stephenegriffin/mfcmapi/issues/392/comments,https://github.com/stephenegriffin/mfcmapi/issues/392#issuecomment-657578952,https://api.github.com/repos/stephenegriffin/mfcmapi/issues/392

When the non-ascii character turns to ?, it is caused passing wrong codepage to WideCharToMultiByte.

But the problem I've reported, MBCS characters are split two SBCS characters.

For example, the character code of ""デ"" is 0x8366 in Codepage 932 (Shift-JIS, the default codepage of Japanese), and it should be 0x30c7 in Unicode.
But stringTowstring handles the MBCS character as multiple SBCS characters, and just change the type from byte to word.
So the character ""デ"" becomes 0x0083 (â) and 0x0066 (f) in Unicode.

This may be OK in US-ASCII world, but it's NG in other language.

However, the functions you identified aren't on the code path for setting or drawing the title here, so touching them won't fix the problem. The problem was exactly as identified in the SO article. Temp swapping in DefWindowProcW for Unicode handling of the message allows us to set the Unicode string without a round trip through ascii. Same trick in the drawing code allows us to get the native Unicode string without another round trip through ascii. So we can stay Unicode native all the way through.

Do let me know if you see any other scenarios where the UI shows ? for unicode characters. I can't fix PR_*_A strings - that conversion happens down in the MAPI layer.

synchronizes its calendar with Outlook.   It only fails in Windows 10 with

of the third party application which is Practice Master by STI , a legal
case management software. This is the message my application generates when
attempting to sync calendars, that is what led me to your thread.  I
appreciate your response and input.  Thank you.

Just talked with stephen, if you are still encountering this issue. Just try to open and close your outlook multiple times. It will resolve the issue.


From yesterday I am having the same issue again with this problem.
My outlook is updated to the newest version and MAPI the newest version as well.

In issue #248 and this issue, i've read that this problem is a MAPI bug.
It also only happens when cached mode is disabled in my outlook profile
But the workaround does not seems to work in my case. 
When I try MFCMAPI version 19.0.19115.01 and double click to open the store, it does nothing at all.

This only appears with some email adresses (O365). 
When i use another outlook profile configured with another email from another O365, it works

Does the O365 plays a part in this bug ?

With on older version 17.0.17069.01 I get the folowing error.
Error:

I am looking for a easy and **fast** (very important) way to detect changes on items since last run of my program. I see, unfortunately a simple compare of PR_LAST_MODIFICATION_TIME is not enough. What about PidTagChangeKey?

Which properties should I compare for a secure detection?
- PR_LAST_MODIFICATION_TIME / PR_CHANGE_KEY
- PR_MESSAGE_FLAGS
- ?

What would you do in that case?

It only controls wheather you want to access the mailbox on the server or on the local .pst file.
I am surprised, because I thought in offline mode is the syncronisation build in there (in MAPI itself). But if I understand you right, the synchronisation is implemented by outlook.

But then I ask myself, why is the reading out of elements in a .pst is very very fast and a .ost very slow. The speed of the online and offline mode does not really differ. I have explained this slow speed for me, that the accessed element has to be checked for up-to-date and a slow connection (RTT) with the office 365 server must be established and, if necessary, to download it again.

specifically from the article:
Note In this same configuration, MFCMAPI.exe crashes when you try to open your mailbox by using the MFCMAPI tool. In that case, the crash signature details match those provided in the preceding sample, and the Application Name value is Mfcmapi.exe.

however, i have an update after the one suggested and still have the issue.  i also tried resetting my VM and using the explicit udpate mentioned and mapi still has an issue.

so, your canned reply was right :), it's a mapi bug!  but it doesn't seem to be fixed.
not sure what to do from here :(.

You have reported a crash. In order to best investigate this report, here is what I need:

1. Exact repro steps. Don't assume I know the steps you followed, or that I would use the same steps that you would.
2. Event log information. Don't upload your evtx files - I won't open them. Don't post a screenshot of your event log either - it's annoying to have to retype hex. Instead, copy/paste the 1000 or 1001 events as text. #48 is a perfect example of how to post event information, especially an event that includes a bucket number.
3. Exact build numbers for Outlook and MFCMAPI.

Thanks for the reply. OK so the problem is Outlook’s internal server. Any ideas how to get rid of the email manually by editing the pst file or some such ? Maybe Windows safe mode will fix it to prevent services running etc ? Something like this ?

 

The stuck email is a pain as it prevents emails going out unless you kill the Outlook process and restart in which case Outlook seems to process the emails in order of size starting with the smallest thankfully !!

 

Thanks

 

Brendan

According to the roadmap to grow, the flow is 
`Startup->Known Startup -> Indian Product based Startup-> International Product based Companies`

## Question : Would you recommend a fresher joining a Service based startup/company as a React Developer?

I am currently working as an Intern, well at least that's what they told but the work requires around 6-8 to be completed.

It's fine now but since its remote, its highly mismanaged. No complaints but now when I am looking for a full time role which will be around May-July, I am applying to only Product based startups even if the pay is max 4.5LPA.

**I personlly feel that joining a Product based firm @ 4.5LPA >> Service based company @ 5-5.LPA.**

---About college placements---
    Find placements outside. People are looking to hire. But they are doing skill based hiring. Show them that you can build           
    software and you'll get in.

     Conventional placements happen on potential. If you don't get the chance to play that game, then play the game of 
     showcasing your skillset.
     jobChallenge was just one idea. No one's stopping you from building a kick-ass portfolio, write blogs, write essays.
   - Do open source.
   - Give talks.
   - Collaborate with peers.
   - Help seniors build projects.
   - Learn to network. 
   - Read programming books and post your summaries. 
   - Be bullish about your Growth. 
   - Everyday go on Discord/Twitter and show your work to the world. 
   - Talk about your progress, your learning.
   - Learn programming. 
   - Learn git. 
   - Learn cloud. 
   World is not looking to hire newbies, what can you do? STOP BEING A NEWBIE. 
 
   And all of this looks hard. You feel OMG, it's easier said than done. But this is how I learnt. Nobody told me what to do, I saw    
   what other people were doing and did that. I know this sounds brutal, but hey! you want to win this tide, it's not gonna be easy.
   Frame this answer.

   
   
---What to do if you don't go to college---

  If you don't want to go to college, don't go to college. But then build your basics.

  Learn about Networking. Write your own webserver. Publish on Github (POG). Publish a Blog (POB). 
 
  Learn about Databases. Write your own database. POG, POB.

  Learn about Software Design. UML Diagrams, Agile. POB. 

  Learn about Algorithms. Publish your own implementations as a library. POG, POB, PoNPM. 

  Learn about programming language. Build your own compiler. PoG, PoB.

  Understand system design. Read blogs from big companies. Write your own understanding. PoB. 

  Learn about Operating Sytems. Try to write your own small OS. Learn linux. 
  POG. Agressively PoB. 

  Learn some math as well. Algebra, Vectors, Matrix, Statistics, probability, graphs. This will serve you well in any field. 

  Learn about Artificial Intelligence. Write your linear regression algorithm. Don't be a script kiddie and run sklearn models. POG,     
 POB. 

 Obviously do all the other things I told in the previous answer. 
 Be complete engineer with the basics and the skills which market demands.

 Additionally, I don't care about your English. But if you can't write 5 words together to make a sentence then it's going to be really    
 difficult for you making your mark without a degree. Communication is key in this world when you want to make a difference. So,  
 yes, please think about this too.

CSS is not easy. It's tough because of many reasons.
1. It's verbose. You need to know a lot of keywords to make it work.
2. It's declarative. Which means your normal programming logic doesn't work.
3. There's cascade which you need to understand. A lot of people don't do CSS well because they don't understand cascade well. 
4. There are tons of other concepts like box sizing, position, media query etc. which you need to understand.

- that tells us about the content what's the book about.
- Read the intro part or the first page where the author tells the moto behind writing the book.
- This can make you excited about the book and can start reading.

At least for me. It means I am putting my personal stamp on you. When I refer someone I put in the system what I admire about the person and why he/she would be a good fit. How the team/organization will benefit from his addition into the team. I think that's one of the reason that when I put a referral the candidate is almost always called for interview. Coz my comments show utmost sincerity and honesty.

I can't do that when I don't know the person. So, messaging me and asking me for a referral I feel is not a valid ask. Question is, ""Can I not get your referral if we haven't worked together?""
Answer is, ""You can! Utilise the community and here's how""

1. Speak in meetups and conferences. I follow a lot of speakers.

2. Write good blogs and share your knowledge. I follow a lot of bloggers.

3. Create something on Github and evangelize it.

4. Participate in discussions on Twitter and LinkedIn.

5. Moderate a telegram group, a subreddit.

6. Start a newsletter. 

Give me a chance to know you better. Let this be organic. In the last 2-3 years of my job at Microsoft I have referred a lot of folks. I love to be the one opening the doors for your next opportunity. But not through DMs, through open collaboration on public platforms.

**Consider “Burger king” (BK) and “Mc-donalds” (MD):**

Both “BK” and “MD” make burgers (for now consider only burgers), but both of them have a different way (framework) of making them and they taste different. BK has its own framework and MD has its own framework for making burgers. Framework controls the way burgers are made.

They might use common materials (libraries) such as cheese, buns etc. made by other manufacturing companies or they might even produce their own.

You could say a framework is a collection of libraries, but the idea is different. (a library is just another module or function which is exposed to be used outside)

Now coming to software framework:

Similarly, in software, a framework is a certain way of writing your software not only a piece of code but your entire application. It’s solving structural and architectural problems on the code level.

For ex:
**This is how you render HTML to the DOM using nothing but plain JavaScript.**
`    var HelloMessage = “<div>Hello world</div>” `
`   document.getElementById(""root"").innerHTML = HelloMessage`

**This is how you render HTML to the DOM using jQuery library.**

`    var HelloMessage = “<div>Hello world</div>” `
`    $(“#root”).html(HelloMessage)`

See how jQuery simplified the DOM node fetching by it’s general “$(node)” syntax, no matter whether its “id” or “class” or “tag”, but it didn’t change the way you assign “<div>” element. (I know it’s a very small example for demo :/)

**Let’s talk in terms of Inversion of control, it will give you a more clear idea.**

When you use a library you have the control over your code. Whenever you need something from the library you simply call it.

On the other hand, when using a framework, the framework is doing most of the work and there are particular places where you insert your code (for ex: In react you put your html (jsx) inside the render function). Framework usually owns the “main” function. In case of react `render()` is the main function.

So whenever the framework needs the application specific code it calls your code. So here the control is “inverted” from you to the framework. This is called inversion of control.

Conclusion: Library gives you a set of functions/modules/APIs which you can use to solve a certain problem, but it doesn’t change your code on the structural or architectural level. On the other hand, frameworks also give you a set of functions/modules/APIs but it does change your code on the structural or architectural level. Library - you call it, Framework - it calls you.

Hope this answers your Question!

In my personal experience I find self study better than going through some coaching because you don't have to keep up with the pace of coaching/tuition. But you have to be systematic with the way you approach you approach competitive questions. Reason I say this is because I have seen people who start by going through difficult question even without know basics and end up frustrated and low because they are not able to solve competitive questions.

1. Start with by learning data structures first. Take one data structure at a time and then go to any competitive site(hackerearth, hackerrank, codechef) of your preference and then start solving questions based on the data structures you have learnt. Most of the sites have question based on data structures.
2. Then go for algorithms and follow same approach.
3. Once you are able to solve all easy levels and few medium level questions, then go for events/competitions online.
4. Participating in time bound event is necessary because it helps you in approach a problem fast which is always the case in interview.

The course has already started at [youtube.com/tanaypratap](youtube.com/tanaypratap) . 
I would advise you to subscribe to it and enable notifications so that you never miss a lesson.

## Order for the Coding part
1. **[Create your profile by learning HTML/CSS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8cl_8ktp9M&list=PLzvhQUIpvvug-c-bExl_xFcopeQi_sa29)** This will get your hands dirty with some HTML, CSS and teach you about Github. It will host your first website that too for free!

2. Once, you have created your portfolio, **[go learn vanillaJS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_R6dvU4820&list=PLzvhQUIpvvuj9nN70USkHJrrSeQ9aiqdB)**. This course will teach you programming in a fun way by creating your first app. Take time with this course. Read MDN docs as mentioned in the course and try to understand most of what is being taught.


## Other Materials

This is a running course and sometimes I make videos about what students ask in some of the live Instagram AMAs, or at the github AMA repo.

Feel free to go through these  **[AMA videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz5_ccyusbg&list=PLzvhQUIpvvuhBNrOVqlhRnhDqz8ob6MeW)** as they answer some of the most asked questions about tech industry.

If you're in college, I would strongly recommend you to go through the videos about **[how to make the most out of your college life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtU-82K3OBQ&list=PLzvhQUIpvvujXvcaIthycttSLChcP_rF2)**.


If you are new to tech industry, I feel that it's imperative to understand how cloud works as it has been a game changer. Please go through the **[cloud series videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsb40ZFBs_Q&list=PLzvhQUIpvvug_CmlkJlzSce4j-w37p3xd)** to understand it better.

Sometimes, you need a little more push towards making a decision or a little more practice on a particular tech. **[Supplements](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hVzE9UEacI&list=PLzvhQUIpvvuhpBvp_dmjPizeHLVpMCxYB)** is for that.

In India to get placements, you need to be good at DS & Algo, so concentrate on that. Once in job, keep a tab on Flutter, it will take some time for Flutter to grow. When it grows, then jump to it.

In cases where your hosting provider has limited bandwidth, say in Github pages it's 1GB per month. You can optimize your site's data usage by following few tricks

### use cdn

Most of our site these days are libraries. jQuery, Bootstrap etc. should be downloaded from CDN and not from your site's root . 
For better performance, try to use one CDN for all libraries. This will reduce the time to resolve domain for multiple sites.

### optimize images

Images form a major chunk of data transferred on the client. However, sometimes we put images which are huge, say 5MB. But that image can be optimized using [squoosh.app](https://squoosh.app/) and you can save precious bytes over wire.

Understand that this will impact your website positively coz the page will load faster

### always serve minified assets

Use modern build tools to minify your javascript and css

### Images from service providers

Imgur serves as a image service provider. You can upload your image and use that URL to show images. This way, images are not served from your bandwidth.

Whether you like to believe it or not, what is shown in movies is not the actual work. It's **not that fancy.** Nobody actively attacks you. There **are bots**. And then there are devices on the other sides which fights these bots, called firewall or advanced levels of firewall. 
So, your job is mostly reduced to seeing the logs and alert. Most of this field is **automated** by Cisco and other big players. Therefore, even though the field has a lot of money, most money goes to these big companies.

Other part is that you have to do a lot of mugging up to pass certifications. These exams are extremely costly and needs almost zero creativity. And if you don't have a certification, your value will be zero.

Penetration Testers also mostly use tools, albeit advanced ones. And they have a playbook. Oh! we found this vulnerability, good, let me try to get escalated privileges with this. So, the creativity scope is quite limited.

Social engineering is some aspect but if you work for a company, which you will work for, that engineering will be left to sending phishing emails.

I am not saying that it's a boring field. I am saying that majority of the work is not as fancy as it seems from outside.

Clearly the if is wrong. I should've used `return tl::make_unexpected(input.error())` instead. The next line was UB.
Obviously the real fix to this bug was to rearrange the lambda and use .map() instead which I did.

`const auto transform = [](const auto& input) { return output{input...}; };`
`const auto out = in.map(transform);`

- `std::optional` has `operator<` etc. similar to your current implementation. So your code's behaviour is kind of expected, except for the difficulty of comparing orders of errors.

First I thought it's a bug in the constant folding but it's actually by-design. You could argue that it's unfortunate, but it's based on the behavior of `decimal.Equals`. I've rewritten the code below to bypass the constant folding. As you can see, the problem is that `1.23m` and `1.2300m` are considered equal, which is why the constant folder collapsed them into the same value slot.

``` sql
WITH Value AS (
    SELECT 1.23 AS Value
),
RoundedValues AS (
    SELECT ROUND(TO_DECIMAL(Value), 2) TwoDigits,
           ROUND(TO_DECIMAL(TO_STRING(Value) + '00'), 4) FourDigits
    FROM   Value v
)
SELECT  r.TwoDigits,               -- 1.23
        r.FourDigits,              -- 1.2300
        r.TwoDigits = r.FourDigits -- True
FROM    RoundedValues r
```

You can replicate the behavior in C#:

``` c#
const decimal twoDigits = 1.23m;
const decimal fourDigits = 1.2300m;
const bool equals = twoDigits == fourDigits;

Console.WriteLine(twoDigits);               // 1.23
Console.WriteLine(fourDigits);              // 1.2300
Console.WriteLine(twoDigits == fourDigits); // true
Console.WriteLine(equals);                  // true

Unfortunately, just applying this attribute does not solve the actual problem. In order to improve performance of expression evaluation NQuery uses .NET lightweight code generation (LCG) to emit MSIL at runtime. To make this work with websites you will need at least a trust level of ""High"" (which is not an option at all). 

At the moment I see to possible ways to circumvent this problem:
1. Place NQuery in the global assembly cache (GAC). In this case NQuery will have implicitly full-trust. NQuery will assert the needed permissions to allow you to run your web application with any trust level.
2. If NQuery does not have the permission ReflectionPermissionFlag.ReflectionEmit it is possible to use interpreted expressions. In some scenarios this can be much slower but at least it would work.

Please allow me to ask you a few questions:
1. Is placing NQuery in the GAC an option for you?- How much data needs to be processed by NQuery?
2. Are you using a lot of queries with nested SELECTS etc?

Answering these questions will help me to decide how to support web site scenarios. Thank you.
