-------

https://github.com/davezuko/react-redux-starter-kit/issues/465

* [x] Replace Express with Koa
* [ ] Refactor configuration overrides
* [ ] Refactor webpack configuration
* [ ] Compile webpack manifest separately from vendor bundle
* [ ] Drop add-module-exports plugin
* [ ] Replace `cheap-module-eval-source-map` in development
  * needs investigation
* [ ] Re-implement better-npm-run
  * rationale: this will allow us to safely/always run tests w/ NODE_ENV=test, which opens up the door for improved configuration.
  *  Also, I'm considering dropping support for the application to be compiled with `NODE_ENV` development since it would simplify babel configuration.
* [ ] Enable automatic server restarts during local development (nodemon/piping/something else)
* [ ] Upgrade react-router to `^2.0.0`
* [x] Document compatible node engines in `package.json`
* [ ] Document recommended npm version (`^3.5.0`) in README
* [ ] Document example projects
* [ ] Document useful utilities (reselect, redux-state-history).
* [ ] Revisit https://github.com/davezuko/react-redux-starter-kit/issues/430
* [ ] Enzyme

More to come.
