1) when does the data begin?

day 1 the repo was opened
day 1 the first issue was created...

2) I believe you collected data from one additional repo. who?


3) What is your third inclusion criteria?

4) what is...

fs::file_copy(
  fs::path_package("githubIssueCollection", "tidy-gh-issues.R"),
  "path-to/issue-data-dir"
)

The gist is that it runs the tidy script, but I don't know how to use it.
