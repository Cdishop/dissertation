1) when does the data begin?

day 1 the repo was opened
day 1 the first issue was created...
- full history of repository

- might fall apart if you have a repo that is transferred from one owner to another


3) What is your third inclusion criteria?



common:
- open an issue adn then resolve their own problem
- or someone who isn't author answers it

- this inclusion says, there must be one action inside of the issue
- if this is included, then the author must have made an action


- issue rows 3 through 7. Opened by someone who isn't associated with repo. then closed by owner and owner left a comment. followed by two comments by original issue author. 

- the owner must appear at least one time in the user association column




4) what is...

fs::file_copy(
  fs::path_package("githubIssueCollection", "tidy-gh-issues.R"),
  "path-to/issue-data-dir"
)

The gist is that it runs the tidy script, but I don't know how to use it.


yes. this runs it and then copies it to your directory. 


fs::file_copy(
  fs::path_package("githubIssueCollection", "tidy-gh-issues.R"),
  "."
)




other points

- thank you
- easy, great. happy to do so again moving forward
- not in academia. like it?



+ re-run the github data collection piece
+ rtweet: don't run on that. That's a collective
++ filter that one out
++ if you want to look up a user. use github_user
++ he didn't pull information about users
++ he has a user table, but the info really isn't that useful

listviewer::
gh::gh("/user") listviewer::jsonedit(gh::gh("/user"))
purrr::map_dfr(issues$user$id, gh_user_by_id) 
gh::gh("/users/:user", user = "lionel-)
