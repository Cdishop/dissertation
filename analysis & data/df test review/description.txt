How many longitudinal data sets with more than two time points?
93 (27 amj; 57 jap; 9 obhdp)

What were the time points like?
as many as 80 and as few as 3. Many with time points consistent with ESM studies: 2 surveys a day for 5 days = 10 time points. or for 10 workdays = 20 time points. 

How many dickey fuller tests or assessment of random walks?
0







# Textbooks

Every textbook has a chapter or two on random processes, dickey-fuller testing, probability theory and stochastic topics, unit root testing, and stationarity assessments. Psychology and organizational behavior textbooks on longitudinal modeling do not. Mostly growth.

Unit roots and random walks, why important?

For a single trajectory, if it is consistent with a random walk then it moves randomly, stochastically. This means that it may do any of the following: rise with an increasing trend over time, decreasing with a downward trend over time, fluctuate around a stable level over time. These three movement patterns are all readily generated from a random walk. 

For 2 or more trajectories (panel data), if one is consistent with a random walk then relationships detected among the different series are more likely than not spurious. The presence of a unit root or unit roots in panel data poses the problem of spurious regressions. In the presence of a unit root, a series presents a peculiar sort of trend that is not deterministic but stochastic, and the presence of such trends in two series containing unit roots may induce an artificial correlation between them.


What are they?

In a simple autoregressive (pure, meaning no concurrent exogenous variable influencing the system) processes, the movement is described by

yt = pyt-1 + errort.

If p is 1, then you have a unit root and the variance of y grows to infinity with t.
