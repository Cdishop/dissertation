## DF test



The test for stationarity begins with a unit root process (i.e., random walk): Yt= pYt-1 + ut (ut is the white noise error term). Thus, the notion of the unit root test of stationarity is to regress Yt on its one period lagged value Yt-1 to see if the p is statistically equal to 1 (Gujarati, 2003; O’Brien, 1999; Watson and Teelucksingh, 2002). If the p is equal to 1, the Y series has a unit root and it is nonstationary (Gujarati, 2003). If the p is statistically different from 1, the Y series does not have a unit root and it is stationary (O’Brien, 2003). The Eviews 6 Student Version does not automatically
tabulate values for the p coefficient for the formula above. However, it can be computed if the above equation is modified (Gujarati, 2003). That is, I subtract Yt-1 from both sides of the above equation: yt−yt-1= α + pyt-1- yt-1 + ut (i.e., this is also known as the first differenced series). If I solve the equation, I get ΔYt= (p-1)Yt-1 + ut. I can treat (p-1) as an estimated coefficient of Yt-1 and the equation becomes ΔYt= δYt-1 + ut. I can test to see if δ is equal to 0; if δ=0, then p=1 (Gujarati, 2003). Since δ = (p-1), for stationarity the value of p must be less than one; thus δ must have a negative value (Gujarati, 2003: 814). 

Furthermore, it is essential to know which test to use in testing the estimated coefficient of Yt-1 to find out whether it is statistically zero or not. As Gujarati (2003) argues, the usual t test cannot be used here because under the null hypothesis that p=1
(i.e., δ=0), the t value of the estimated coefficient of Yt-1 does not have an asymptotic normal distribution. Thus, I need to use critical values of the tau statistic (τ), which is also known as the Dickey-Fuller critical values. In addition, MacKinnon (1991) prepared a more extensive table for critical values and these values are programmed into the
Eviews 6 Student Version package. These MacKinnon critical values are directly calculated and tabulated by Eviews to test the null hypothesis in unit root test.

The Dickey-Fuller test can also be estimated in three different forms: Yt is a random walk (ΔYt= δYt-1 + ut); Yt is a random walk with drift (ΔYt= α + δYt-1 + ut); and Yt is random walk with drift and time trend (ΔYt= α + βt + δYt-1 + ut) (Gujarati, 2003; O’Brien, 1999; Watson and Teelucksingh, 2002). In this study, I use the second equation. In all of the cases, the null hypothesis is the same; that is, δ=0 (i.e., p=1). If the null hypothesis is rejected, Yt is stationary with a mean of zero in the first equation; Yt is stationary with a non-zero mean in the second equation; and Yt is stationary with a nonzero mean and time trend in the third case (Gujarati, 2003; Watson and Teelucksingh,
2002). In each case, I use OLS regression to estimate these equations, and divide the estimated coefficient of Yt-1 by its standard error to find the tau statistic (τ) and refer to critical values reported by Eviews (Gujarati, 2003). If the computed tau statistic (τ) in
absolute value (i.e., ADF test statistic in Eviews output) exceeds the MacKinnon critical tau values, I reject the hypothesis that δ=0 (i.e., p=1) with the conclusion that series is stationary (Gujarati, 2003). In contrast, if the computed tau statistic (τ) in absolute value is smaller than MacKinnon critical tau values, I accept the null hypothesis and conclude
that series is nonstationary.

Said & Dickey (1984); it is possible to test the hypothesis difference = 0 without knowing p or q (p being row and q being the moving average coefficient). Arima (p, 1, q). 

The value of d indicates the amount of differencing necessary to reduce the series to stationary. The number d also equals the number of unit roots in the characteristic equation for the time series.

Dickey & Said (1981) discuss how to test for d = 1 when p and q are known.



The Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test is used to determine if a variable has a unit root or is stationary. A variable has a unit root, if after a shock, it does not move back to a longrun trend. Dickey and Fuller (1979) showed that the null hypothesis of their test is that the series has a unit root and is non-stationary. The test gives you the choice of including a constant, a constant and a linear time trend, or none in the regression. Including the constant and trend is the most general specification, and was the choice for this study. Also, the test allows for the specification of the number of lagged differenced terms. A lag of one was chosen for this study since the data is of annual prices and quantities. Based on the results of the ADF, the null hypothesis of a unit root cannot be rejected for level data (Table 1).


The ADF test is one way of testing the existence of a unit root in a time series process. It represents a more general test than the traditional Dickey-Fuller test because it takes into account the possibility of having a random walk process with serial correlation in the errors. That is, it takes into account that the possible time series representation for the process in question could be an autorregresive specification of order p with a unit root, commonly known in the time series jargon as ARIMA (1, 1, 0).



Most real world data in non-stationary in nature, but you need stationary data for forecasting. Non-stationary time series can arise for many reasons: a non-constant mean, non-constant variance, or both. 

The statistical basis for our estimation and forecasting depends on series being covariance stationary. 

In deterministic trend series, the trajectory trends due to a "time" variable constant.

In a stochastic trend series, the trajectory is a random walk and it happens to be trending up or down.

Unit root test: whether phi is 1 or not. 

When we have a stationary system, the effect of a shock will die out gradually.

When we have a non-stationary system, the effect of a shock is permanent. 





# unit root tests

If a unit root exists, then typical regression-based analyses cannot be applied to the data structure to make inferences about the underlying process. 

Consider an AR(1) process: yt = phi*yt-1 + errort

We want to test whether phi is equal to 1. Subtracting yt-1 from both sides we can rewrite the AR(1) model as:

delta(yt) = yt - yt-1 = (phi - 1)yt-1 + error t

And now a test of phi = 1 is a simple t-test of whether the parameter on the "lagged level" of y is equal to zero. This is called a dickey-fuller test. 

Dickey and Fuller computed the critical values using Monte Carlo techniques to test for the stationarity of the data.

The DF is generalized to the augmented DF test to accomodate the general ARIMA and ARMA models.


# DF vs augmented

DF is to test for the presence of a unit root in time series. The augmented test was developed to accomodate more complex models with unknown orders.


# Problems with unit roots

In multivariate frameworks, unit roots lead to spurious regression results.

In univariate frameworks, unit roots cause OLS estimates of AR(1) coefficients to be biased. 




## Random Walks

# on graphs

The classical one-dimensional random walk describes the discrete steps of a particle on a lattice (e.g. Z) and its position at the n th tim e step can be characterized by S n = X\ + ... 4- X n where Aj’s are independent and equal to 1 or -1 w ith probability 0.5. The d-dimensional lattice version similarly allows the particle to travel one unit in any direction along the lattice with equal probability.
