1) short ish

Imagine if I told you about my colleague who is encouraging and always provides assistance -- much more so than others that I work with. When we think of a person like that, all of us think that her behavior must be driven by her motives, her personality, her dispositions, something exceptional about her. 

Imagine if I told you about my colleague who is encouraging and always provides assistance -- much more so than others that I work with. What causes her to act that way? We naturally think of her motives, her personality, her dispositions, something exceptional about her. 

I want to show that, instead, a random process can account for it.
I want to show that her behavior could actually be driven by chance. She could be no more trustworthy, no more compassionate, no more caring, no more generous, no more charitable than others, yet if my process occurs, she will demonstrate exceptional behavior. 

I want to show that chance/randomness can actually create what appears to be exceptionally charitable or compassionate behavior. 

You could have two people that share the same motives, the same dispositions, they are the same person, but a chance process could account for her behavior.






2) really short


Let's say you and I work together. How many times do you have to help me for me to know that you are actually a helpful person and this exchange wasn't just chance, it wasn't a one-off?
