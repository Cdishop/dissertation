# Good phrasing

Building upon a famous result
on long leads in random walks (Feller 1968), this
paper demonstrates that such a process will typically
generate sustained differences in resources. As a result,
in situations where profitability is an increasing function
of the level or the quality of resources, the most
likely outcome is not that the average profits of firms
equalize over time. Rather, the most likely outcome is
that there is a group of firms with consistently high
profits and a group of firms with consistently low
profits.


# random walk versus must increase random walk. How to test?

For an initial illustration of this outcome, consider
the situation featured in the introduction. Two firms
compete for customers, and a critical resource, such as
the speed of the computers produced, follows a random
walk. The firm that is able to produce the faster
computer in a given year makes a profit of $10 million,
while the other firm makes a profit of $5 million.
Due to the phenomenon of long leads, it is very likely

that one firm has the faster computers, and thus, the
higher profit, during most of the observed period. For
example, if the firms are observed during 10 years,
i.e., n=10, it follows from Equation (5) that the probability
that either Firm 1 or Firm 2 will have the highest
product quality during all 10 years, and thus an
average profit of $10 million, is 35%. This also implies
that the distribution of average profits will not be concentrated
at $7.5 million. Rather, the distribution of
average profits will be bimodal, with $5 million and
$10 million as the most likely outcomes.
The implication of such a bimodal distribution is
that it is very likely that the average profit of the two
firms will differ substantially. Using the approximation
introduced in the previous section, we have that
the expected absolute difference in average profitability
is 3.18 and the median is 3.54.7 Observations of
such large differences in average profitability might
suggest that it would be unlikely that the difference
was generated by chance. And indeed, a two-tailed
t-test of the difference between average profits shows
most often that the difference is significant at a significance
level of 5%. However, since the data are generated
by dependent rather than independent draws,
such a test would be inappropriate. A proper test,
using the distribution generated by a random walk as
the null hypothesis, would instead show that even a
difference in average profitability of $5 million based
on 10 years is not significant. Indeed, it would require
approximately 510 periods before a difference in average
profitability of $5 million would lead to rejection
of the null hypothesis of a random walk.

Obviously, the mapping between resource stocks
and profitability levels is unlikely to have the
“tournament-like” quality of this example. However,
to the extent that resource stocks are related to competitive
advantage (Barney 1991), profitability is likely
to be an increasing function of the stocks of resources.
If so, the general proposition that a random resource
accumulation process is likely to generate sustained
interfirm profitability differences follows. Specifically,
consider an industry with n firms in which profitability
of firm i in period ti t is a strictly increasing
function of the stocks of the resources of firm i in
period t, Ri t . Formally, 1 t >2 t if and only if R1 t >
R2 t. In this case the profitability rankings of firms will
be subject to long leads exactly as outlined in the previous
section. For example, if b =1 and n=100, a firm
spends, on average, 83% of the time either among the
50% most profitable or among the 50% least profitable
firms during the first 10 periods. Thus, there will be
persistent differences in profitability rankings.

## my thoughts

So, the underlying idea is a random walk. But his real life example is an accumulation on something that must increase. How do you test it?
