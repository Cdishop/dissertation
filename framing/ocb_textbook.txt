# random walk

lots of material on evaluating ocbs, on people rating it. Tie this in to the random walk stuff. If you are trying to praise someone for sustained, superior helping, be careful.

p.479 all about antecedents to help. Motives, personality, etc. 

p. 495 little attention on how requests for help interplay with help itself to inform organizational performance. We respond to this call.
