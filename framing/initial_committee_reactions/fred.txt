# 1) Social Capital

Bizzi, 2015 (international encyclopedia of the social & behavioral sciences, 2nd edition, volumn 22

An outcome of helping. After you help, you accumulate social capital from your peers, and that gives you advantages (reputation, people like you, etc).

What I am talking about is potential capital. You haven't yet acted, but if you did it would give you social capital. 

# 2) comparative effectiveness research

NIH got sick of funding research from one perspective
- does cognitive behavioral therapy work?

Now, they fund research that is comparative:
- is cognitive behavior or interpersonal therapy better?

I am kind of establishing a similar argument in my paper.

# 3) Bandura random chance factors

Look up paper.

# 4) BBC article on opportunity structure

After the civial war, whites and blacks were equal in their level of poverty. After 3 generations, the whites were way ahead, essentially they were back to the advantages that they had before the civial war. Why?
- they had different opportunities







# Bandura chance

Gladkova, 2017

Bandura conceptualises chance as‘an unin-tended meeting of persons unfamiliar with eachother’(Bandura, 1982: 748). He postulates thattwo sets of separate but interactive constructsshould be taken into consideration as we try tounderstand how chance affects the life course:personal determinants and social milieus. Onthe personal side, chance meetings are most likelyto affect life courses if they get converted into alasting relationship. Interpersonal attraction, aswell as personal characteristics such as people’sattributes, belief systems, interests, and compe-tences influence whether a chance encounter willturn into a strong tie or not. On the social side, theimpact of chance encounters depends on the‘holding and shaping power of the milieus into which people are fortuitously inaugurated’(Bandura, 2001: 12). Social circles with their be-liefs, value systems and prescribed behaviourpatterns, and the kind of people who populatethem make some chance encounters more proba-ble and leave a stronger impact on people’s livesthan others (Bandura, 1982).
