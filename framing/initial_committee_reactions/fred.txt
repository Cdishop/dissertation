# 1) Social Capital

Bizzi, 2015 (international encyclopedia of the social & behavioral sciences, 2nd edition, volumn 22

An outcome of helping. After you help, you accumulate social capital from your peers, and that gives you advantages (reputation, people like you, etc).

What I am talking about is potential capital. You haven't yet acted, but if you did it would give you social capital. 

# 2) comparative effectiveness research

NIH got sick of funding research from one perspective

Now, they fund research that is comparative:
- is cognitive behavior or interpersonal therapy better?

I am kind of establishing a similar argument in my paper.

# 3) Bandura random chance factors

Look up paper.

# 4) BBC article on opportunity structure

After the civial war, whites and blacks were equal in their level of poverty. After 3 generations, the whites were way ahead, essentially they were back to the advantages that they had before the civial war. Why?
- they had different opportunities
